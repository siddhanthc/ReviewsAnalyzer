	They are letting the place rot	they are budget hotels and there are budget hotels. but this is the worst hotel ever. very depressing. no upkeep. shower appliances coming off the hook. stained carpets. personal unfriendly/demoralized. i think they want to get rid of the budget crowd altogether. i left after one night. do you yourself a favor and go to a better hotel nearby.	
Nov 13 2009 	unbelievably tranquil and luxurious	I just got back from Beijing yesterday and can't rave enough! I'm 20 years old and stayed in a room with my older aunt and two young cousins (both under 12) and all four of us fell in love with the plethora of chinese and western breakfast assortments (from fresh and safe fruit to buttery homestyle croissants and traditional american bacon eggs and hash browns) and tranquil and luxurious enviornment. The staff was above and beyond helpful and attentive. The bartenders in the hotel bar are not only beautiful but very funny and comforting. My favorites being Kitty, Lily, Zheng, and Melody! The hotel is right across from Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Cartier, Burberry, etc. and when it's snowing, its unbelievably magestic! We stayed for 5 days and 4 nights and found every moment in the hotel, dining room, and pool to be absolutely FABULOUS!! The hotel offers enough western tradition while never masking the Chinese culture. If I had the option to go back I would do so weekly!! Everything was very clean, and organized making relaxation while getting a massage or laying by the infinity-like pool beautiful. If you have the opportunity to visit Beijing absolutely make it a point to stay at this hotel (the new part I would recomment as I've never seen the older rooms) at least for one night. It is absolutely worth every penny!!!	
Nov 11 2009 	Good location wonderfull breakfast!	A mistake occurred with our booking, but it was no problem, we were up-graded and we had 3 great rooms, 2 of them, suites! It was the only place we truly enjoyed in Beijing, breakfast was great, if you are a foreigner in CHINA, you need to get a good breakfast because you dont know where you might find appropriate food again! Beijing was cold but when we walked into the hotel, it felt like heaven, great service!	
Oct 21 2009 	Great location but dated stuffy rooms	My husband and I live in China and came to Beijing with his parents who are visiting from Canada. We arranged a private tour with CITS and were booked at the Novotel Beijing Peace. You could not ask for a better location, walking distance to the Forbidden City and the Wangfujing Night Market (snack street) and if you are a shopper, Louis Vuitton and Burberry are just a stones throw away. The lobby was large and grand and looks like what you would expect from a 4 star hotel. After a reasonably quick check in, we headed to our rooms on the 15th floor, our room was a fairly large corner room with a spectacular view but this is where the stars started to fad! The room was very dated with bad carpet, an uncomfortable and well used love seat and a brass and glass table straight from the 80's. The bathroom was disgusting!!! The toilet seat was so old that it had yellowed and the fixtures were ancient and decrepit. To top it off the rooms were stuffy and hot and the windows did not open. In our room there was no A/C but we were able to turn a fan on to get some of the air moving but my in laws were not so lucky. My husband then went down to the front desk to complain about the air conditioning and to get different room for his parents and was told that the hotel was booked and there were no other rooms available. They also told him that no rooms in the hotel had A/C at this time of year and that it was like that in all hotels in Beijing!!! Please, this is not our first trip to Beijing and we have stayed in countless hotels during all seasons, don't give us that crap! After some negotiating the in laws were moved to a new room - better but still no A/C and the room stank of smoke even though we were on a non smoking floor. The next morning we headed down for a delicious buffet breakfast which was included in our stay. The food was very good for a buffet and the selection was abundant. The hostess that brought us to our seats was friendly enough as were the many chefs and cooks but the waiting staff were in need of some serious customer service training. We were half finished our breakfast before we were able to get someone to bring us some coffee and even then it seemed like we were bothering her. It looked like none of the waiting staff were happy to be there, moving slowly and never smiling.I would also like to say that the cost of the internet in the room is outrageous at 150 RMB for 24 hours (although this is not exclusive of this hotel).Anyways, long story short - I will not be staying at this hotel in the future and I would not recommend it to anyone.	
Oct 18 2009 	Superb location / comfortable accomodations / great breakfast	I'm a fan of Novotel and found this location to fully meet my expectations. Clean, comfortable, quite room with an excellent breakfast buffet. Concierge helpful with navigating to destinations in the city. Only negative was the consistently grumpy breakfast buffet employees who served up food and coffee with a grimace.	
Oct 14 2009 	almost 4 points but what a shame the service is so bad and the lobby just disguting...	I'm staying often in this hotel for business and if a few years ago, this property was extremly bad with disguting rooms, the refurnishment of the rooms has been really well done and in regard to the value, Novotel Peace is now a good deal in Beijing and a quite good choice...OK, if we focus on the service, it's still very average with a staff not good at all in english and not very smily. You have always the impression to disturb them when you need something. The staff at the reception could try to think why they have decided to work in the hospitality industry cause it's hard to see... Same at the restaurant for the buffet breakfast, don't even expect any smile or any &quot;good morning&quot; and don't forget the hot drinks are in self service cause if you ask them, it could make them unhappy...About the concierge, if you need any &quot;tip&quot; about the city or a restaurant, i highly recommend you to refer to your &quot;Lonely Planet&quot;Anyway, you understand you will do not choose this hotel for the quality of service but more probably for the location just in the middle of the city at 20 minutes walk from the Forbidden City and easy access for shopping and sightseeing; for a very good value cause the rooms have been renovated and spend a bit more to stay at the Executive level cause if the bathrooms are a bit dated in the standard and deluxe rooms, the ones of the Executive rooms are brand new with a large shower very comfy; for a good design of the rooms, modern and zen, different from what you expect to find in a Novotel; for the very acceptable size of the rooms making a stay with a third person absolutely possible and for the buffet breakfast offering a good and yummy selection of sweet and salted dishes (crèpes are really good and friend veggies so delicious...).However, if the rooms are nicely decorated, the lobby is still not renovated and looks like from an other century often with an ugly flower arrangement and with dirty and very old sofas in the lounge. I hope the management is thinking about re-designing the lobby cause this is the first impression the guests have when checking...But due to the excellent rooms and this incredible value for money, this property is close to 4 points but a lot of things have to be improved and for now, let's just say this hotel is recommandable but nothing amazing...	
Oct 10 2009 	Great location	Stayed here for a couple of nights before attending a conference just out of Beijing. The Novotel is well located, close to the big ticket sights. The hotel met the standards that you would expect of its chain. The buffet dinner was relatively expensive by Beijing standards, and there were probably more affordable &quot;Chinese cuisine&quot; options within walking distance.	
Oct 9 2009	Comfortable base in Beijing	We stayed at the Novotel Peace for three nights, this being the first leg of our seven city tour of China.After passing through strict swine flu checks at Beijing Airport we arrived late morning at the hotel.The hotel has a large, impressive lobby with a wide staircase at its centre. At the time of our visit, a huge mooncake was displayed on a table in the centre of the lobby.Having stayed at several Novotels in the UK, this was in a completely different league. The room was large, with two double beds and floor to ceiling windows offering views along the busy road running outside of the hotel and over the rooftops of Beijing.The bathroom was a little tired but was perfectly adequate.There is a separate room for Internet use, but two free computers were available on a 'first come first served' basis in the lobby area towards the lifts, however these were almost always in use.Breakfast was included in the price and was varied, catering for all nationalities. The lobby bar was expensive but was quite comfortable and relaxing after a hard day's sightseeing.We ate in The Square restaurant, also on the ground floor, on the last night, where we had a tasty Nasi Goreng and Club Sandwich.As mentioned by most reviewers, the situation of the Novotel is perfect. Ten minutes walk to Wanfujing Street and the evening food street, serving such exotics as Sheep's Testicles and Sheep's Penis!The hotel organised a taxi one evening to take us to the Houhai Bar and restaurant area and wrote on a pad the Chinese name for the Novotel which we had to present to the taxi driver for our return trip as they would never have understood us otherwise.I would recommend the Novotel to anyone visiting Beijing. In addition to the obvious sights such as Tiananmen Square, Forbidden City, Summer Palace, Hutongs and the Great Wall, do make the effort to visit the Temple of Heaven in the south of the city. If you get there early you will be entertained by hundreds of locals singing, ballroom dancing, playing musical instruments and practising tai-chi - an definite highlight of a Beijing trip.	
Oct 1 2009 	A bit of a disappointment	If you're searching for an affordable hotel within walking distance to the heart of the city, Novotel Peace is not a bad choice for the price BUT don't expect much. The lobby is deceivingly well-furbished but as soon as you're shown to your room, you'd be a little disappointed. The first three days were were in a twin room. It was a pretty good sized room but it was oddly shaped, facing the backstreet, and worst of all, there must have been some plumbing problems because part of the carpet was wet all the time. We didn't complain because we were barely in our room, but on our 3rd day, half the room was soaked! We received a note from the reception saying that they would like to reassign us to an &quot;upgraded&quot; room on the 12th floor. They should have done this a long time ago but we should also have complained. It was a nuisance packing our stuff and moving on our last evening knowing that we'd have to re-pack the next day. The &quot;upgraded room&quot; was a twin-Queen room with a nice view of the surroundings but there was mould living in the bathroom and its condition was worst that our first room.Besides our rooms, the facilities and service is a meager &quot;ok&quot;. The swimming pool cannot accommodate more than two serious swimmers, breakfast (if not included with the price of the room) is pretty expensive for Beijing standards (15 Euros per person) and although the variety of food is great, you'd get a better deal at local restaurants. Service? There wasn't quite much besides organized tours which was overpriced. My mom and I paid 600 RMB for a driver to take us to the Great Wall and the Ming Courts. We sorta regretted later as the driver was always rushing us. We decided to go for this option in the first place to AVOID the hectic of tours. One word of advise: take a whole day for the Summer Place. It's worth it and you can get there easily by taxi. Check out the option of taking a ferry from the zoo.My mom and I decided that we would split up our week's stay in Beijing first staying at a traditional Hutong courtyard hotel 15 minutes from the city center and then move to a more conventional hotel for the swimming pool and travel convenience. All our knowledge about Beijing stemmed from travel guides and internet sites so we didn't really know the layout of the city. Although Novotel Peace is really close to the Forbidden City (20 minutes walk) and to the shopping district of Wangfujing (5 minutes walk), our Hutong (Ji House Courtyard Hotel: www.jihousecn.com), situated close to Gulou was a much better place to stay in terms of sight seeing and nightlife. It gave us a more authentic feel for Beijing, whereas Wangfujing area is over-priced, over-westernized, and not too exciting. However, the second day of our stay at Novotel, we discovered lots of small, wonderful local boutiques behind the hotel great for shopping. Verdict: I'd will most likely try another hotel next time. If the price is right (we paid 50 Euros per night which was really cheap), and if you don't plan to spend too much time at the hotel, sure, it's not too bad of an option.	
Sep 29 2009 	Unbelievable service and value!	We had a fantastic stay at the Novotel Peace. Great location, very close to Wangfujing shopping and the snack street. Walking distance to Forbidden City and Tiananmen. The room was very clean and comfy, with nice furnishings. And finally, the concierges were beyond fantastic. Friendly, courteous, went above and beyond in making sure that our taxi drivers knew exactly where we were going (and we went to some unusual places). They also can quickly and easily arrange a car to the Wall or other popular spots for a fairly standard price. Really a great place; would recommend to anyone. One note: paid internet in the room, but free wifi in lobby and also two computers in lobby for general quick use.	
Sep 26 2009 	LOCATION AND...LOCATION	We booked this hotel after reading the somewhat positive comments on this site, and locating it on a map....Well, we did found the location to be near perfect....The hotel is facing the Peninsula (wich has a Bank of China international ATM in its basement floor), Lee's Garden Hotel,etc...I did felt a ''western'' athmosphere in this aera, wich is not bad...it kinda allows you to digest more easily the somethimes-intense sightseeing during the day...There's an entire trendy shopping aera minutes away, with a fantastic shopping center at about 10 min walking from the hotel, with numerous and great restaurants;ranging from Pizza Hut to South Silk Road (wich I highly recommend)...The Forbidden City is at about 15-20 minutes walk, (for the north gate, if not mistaking), but would suggest to take a cab (about 10RMB), and keep your energy for inside the city, since theres already a lot of walking and standing still inside the city)...The temple of Heaven is a couple of minutes away by cab from the hotel, etc...Theres a very nice tea shop just next to hotel (can't miss the waterfall-tea pot outside)...We did avoid it at first since we where afraid to get scammed there, but actually, after comparing it to Xi An tea shops, the prices are very reasonable...When we first checked-in, they located us in the west-wing. First thing we noticed is the ridiculeous walking distance from the lobby to the room, and the awfull looking carpet waiting for you in the 4th floor hall....It looks like all the toilets from the floor rooms have leaked and spoiled the carpet...all the way...But the rooms where renovated, and had quite a lot of storage facilities...The bathroom was nice, with a separated glass-shower unit. After our trip from Xi An, they relocated us in the east-wing, in a corner room, and the room, although a bit aged, was huge, with a nice corner wall-window, etc...The breakfast brunch is ridiculeously overpriced, the internet is free if don't mind standing up and having some people waiting from you in your back, and reading your e-mails with you (only 2 screens) . If you want tu use it the business office, it costs about 3RMB/minute for internet...But the worst was probably the service....I wasnt expecting an unforgettable consumer service in China (no offence), but since this hotel is proudly french-owned, they should seriously thinking about teaching the staff to be more friendlier....But I guess that tall-french dude who seems to be the manager there is more busy talking about China's car-prices with the bell-boys than talking care of business...All in all, its really the location that makes it a great deal for us, since the rest is kinda forgettable...	
Sep 20 2009 	Location can't be beat great value here	The location is perfect for Beijing, just 3 minutes walk to Wanfujing shopping street. Not too far to the subway, I think about a 10 minute walk. The food in the buffet restaurant was really excellent, and a great value for money. I went to other Beijing buffets, most were much more expensive and not have as good or generous as here. The room was fine, about 3.5 to 4 stars, everything worked great, especially the air conditioning. There is an older and newer tower, the newer seems a bit nicer and more recently refurbished. Compared to other Beijing hotels, this is an outstanding value for money.	
Sep 16 2009 	Value for Money - Great Location and Service!	I stayed in Novotel with my partner for 5 days in Beijing. We managed to get a good deal online for only USD65 per night. Location was good, just a stone throw from WangfuJing, although it is about 8mins walk to the nearest MRT station, it was ok. Room was rather small but good. Good housekeeping service and free WiFi in the room and internet at the lobby. Clean sheets and hot water!Only grasp is the bed is hard. Don't be surprised to wake up to shoulder ache for the first 10mins in the morning. Also, breakfast is USD 17 per pax which is ridiculously expensive! But there is a nearby shopping centre which has Mac 24hrs and eatery that opens at 8am.. and at another corner, a breadshop that opens at 6am so no worries there!Stay here if you are fine with a run in a mill hotel, with good location.	
Sep 5 2009 	Affordable luxury in the heart of Beijing	I was impressed the minute I walked in the lobby. We were immediately greeted by a bellhop who took our bags. My daughter and I arrived at midnight and were told that my son who had arrived at 9:00 a.m. had checked in at that time. I assumed he would have had to wait until the afternoon to get into a room. My request for an extra blanket was immediately met. The room was very clean. The concierge was always very helpful. When he made reservations for us to see an acrobatic show we arrived expecting to be shown to the cheap seats that we paid for, but we were taken the center of the front row. The free buffet breakfast was great. The only thing I disliked was the smoking in the lobby and bar. Unfortunately that seems to be the norm anywhere in China.	
Sep 4 2009 	Great location usual Novotel style rooms	I got put up here on a business trip to Beijing, I didnt have any choice of the hotel. After my business trip I spent 2 weeks travelling round China and when I returned to Beijing I chose the Emperor hotel, which is worth checking out, a little pricier, but fantastic.I thought the hotel was fine as a business hotel, I spent a very happy week here. The location is great and when I had a little time to myself I was able to quite happily see many parts of the city on foot. The breakfast at the hotel is of a good standard and has a wonderful array of choice from Western and Eastern selections.The rooms are typical Novotel style, if you have stayed at a Novotel or similar standard chain hotel before you will know what to expect.The taxi hailing staff outside are fabulous, they ran around outside hailing taxis for me at all times of the day and night, in the rain, everything. Big thank-you to them. A good pick I think if it suits your budget - enjoy Beijing!	
Aug 26 2009 	Perfect location for touring the Forbidden City	We stayed on the Club level and the room and the service were very nice. We had a king room with a comfortable couch that was big enough for our adult son to sleep on. They did not charge for the third person. We enjoyed a view of the Forbidden City from our room. The Club level includes an elaborate breakfast buffet and happy hour with free drinks and hor d'oeuvres. The only negative was that the bed was a Chinese bed and very hard.	
Aug 25 2009 	not so nice hotel and not a nice staff	This hotel was a bad experience. I am a A club goldmember that is a card where you get some extra's. You can get a free upgrade when the hotel is no full and also you can get late check out. With the booking i asked the hotel to give me a upgrade from the superior room to the excutive room. When we checked in the staff did not know anything about the request of our upgrade. There came a lady to help and she told me that next time that i want mine upgrade i need to call the hotel. But in the reservation form of the hotel you can put a text for the hotel. She sad to me that she will give us a upgrade because the hotel was half full.The upgrade was nothing just a bigger superiorroom and not what the website of the hotel told us a room with free internet and a apple dockingstation.They also made a mistake with the internetconection. You can by internet for 24 hours we did that for 3 days. When we want to settle the bill they charged us 4 days of internet. When we explained to the reception that there was a mistake the girl did not want to listen because she did not understand us. After 20 minutes complaining and explaining she charged us 3 days. But she still did not understand us.The rooms are not very nice and very old the really need to upgrade the rooms.The breakfast was a real party a great buffet with a lot of choice.I will never stay again in Novotel Peace Beijing because of the service the don't give.	
Aug 12 2009 	Fantastic hotel central location nice pool	Amazing foyer!. Room spacious and very clean. Swimming pool on second floor very pleasant with large changing rooms and small gym. Breakfast buffet excellent choice of european and asian cuisine. Dodgy coffee machine though!Great location for walking to Forbidden City and Tianamen Square. Wear comfortable shoes and buy some water from the shops along the way. Takes about 20 mins to get there. Lots of restaurants to choose from too. Main shopping area Wanfujing is not far from the hotel. Very pretty at night lit up. Supermarket across the road (and down a side street )from the hotel sells drinks and snacks cheaply.	
Aug 7 2009 	Great location	Overall our 5 day stay was great. The staff is friendly but service is not upto the mark. My coffee sachet in the room was not replaced after the first one. House keeping should have seen to it. I used the coffee from the kid's room.The location of the hotel is the best. Close to shopping and restaurants. I would go back and stay there again.	
Aug 3 2009 	Decent central hotel - good option for small families and others	We spent 5 nights at the Novotel in mid-July -a large, bland, good-quality, reasonably priced Western chain hotel located in central Beijing. We opted for an executive room (somewhat more expensive but assures you of a better quality room) - all was fine with it. - Views - We were on a top floor and did not have a view over the Forbidden City - apparently there are very few rooms with good views in that direction.- Cost - We checked out the main discount websites and were able to get a much better deal directly from the Novotel - about 20% off the regular sale rates, but for a non-changeable non reimbursable reservation. We had to become members of the Novotel/Ibis/Sofitel &quot;frequent users&quot; group - free and easy to do over the web - to access the lowest prices though.- Families with teens - A huge advantage of the Novotel is that kids (at least 1, probably 2) stay free in rooms up to age 16, unlike the 12 year cut-off of most hotels. That lowered our costs a good deal, and makes the Novotel an especially good option for small families.- Location - in central Beijing, near a subway stop, near huge shopping malls and a shopping street, a long walk or short taxi ride from the Forbidden City, etc. We went to the acrobat show one night and had trouble finding a taxi afterwards - ended up taking the metro back (a stop was right beside the theater) and got home faster and at 5% the cost in the end. FYI - subways (metros) are easy to use, with announcements in English as well as in Chinese. There are plenty of ATMs in the area (across the street and in the nearby Peninsula Hotel). Too, there is a good nearby food shop - turn right as you leave the hotel, then take the first left;- it is maybe 40 meters down that road - good for getting snacks and reasonably priced bottled water, etc.- Our room was in excellent shape. Yes, the hotel is not brand new but our room was kept in very good condition, strong water pressure for showers, safe included, a sitting area with two small sofas and a coffee table, a flat-screened TV, etc. - Pool - small but fine, about impossible for people to do laps and have kids in the pool at the same time.- The front desk and concierge desk staff were fine - well-informed and pleasant. We went to a less travelled part of the Great Wall and were able to get a good English-speaking driver for the day for 600 yuan in a comfortable car. (You can negotiate a regular taxi down to about 400 yuan, but forget about English, comfort, and a fair number of Beijing taxi drivers are formula 1 wannabees...- Internet - there are two recent apple computers in the front lobby for guests to use for free - quick access to websites. I think (not sure) that wifi is also available for those with their own laptops.- Breakfast - The Novotel breakfast buffet is both excellent and overpriced (around 22 USD per person), so we ate there once. It is too bad that they don't offer a lower-priced continental breakfast for people not travelling on an expense account... We never found a good substitute breakfast restaurant in the area - places to eat at the nearby mall and shopping street open up too late, etc. Twice we bought pastries at a nearby store and milk, Nescafe and yogurt at another, and ate in our room. Would we return? Yes, but without a lot of enthusiasm as, again, the hotel is bland but fine. It is a good option for small families on a budget and for business travelers. We would have preferred going to a more typical Chinese hotel in a Hutong but, in the end, are glad we did not - taxis are loathe to enter into those areas (roads are very narrow), most do not know of the smaller Hutong hotels and, for a first trip to China, being in a large western chain with an English-speaking staff and easy to access made it worth it...	
Aug 1 2009 	Initially disappointing got better	Arrived late at 11.00 pm. Although we have booked and paid for in advance by many months and advised them we were going to arrive late they hadn't pre-allocated us our requested rooms - two adjoining rooms as we were a family of five in the main block preferably higher up with a view towards the Forbidden City ( I had read other Trip Advisor reviews to ask for this.) . Instead they gave us two old rooms on different floors in the adjoining tower - room numbers start with 2 if you are at reception and they try to give you one of these rooms. They said they were fully booked that night and that there was no other option - letting us inspect the rooms to see if they are suitable. After a 20 hour flight what could we do - say they weren't suitable and go to another hotel ??? remember we had pre-paid. Anyway they promised to move us the next day. In the adjoining block the carpets were very water stained and smelt musty - the hallways had low ceilings and the rooms looked like they hadn't changed since the 1960's. The beds very very very hard - so it was better to lie on your back to try and spread the pressure of your body over the mattress rather lie on your side and know where all the pressure points are. Anyway they did move us the next day to the main block to Level 10. We did have a distant view to the Forbidden City and to the back of the Novotel where they was still a cluster of Hutongs. The beds were much better here. Rooms were spacious and about average - we have been to better Novotels in other countries. There is free wireless internet at the lobby bar - room internet is exhorbitantly priced and although they had two free Macs in the lobby one was down and the other one was lways being used. Breakfast was nice although a bit pricey. Cheaper good food at the mall 5 minutes walk down to Wafujing St on the 6th floor. Bottled water in the rooms a rif off considering you could get it for 1.4 RMB from the local convinience store - why pay 60 RMB in the room. Stayed 11 nights - great central location - walked the second day to the Forbidden City - would have been better to take the taxi as it was 35 degrees Celcius!	
Jul 20 2009 	Alot to learn about guest expectations	Outstanding location, poor service. A weekend treat away from Bangkok to Beijing where the worst service we had all weekend was on the executive floor of this hotel. Staff are surely poorly trained if they cannot offer you a glass of water in the lounge rather than give you a lecture on how they will charge you for a bottle of water instead. Thankfully all the other places and service we encountered in Beijing contradicted this poor impression.	
Jul 17 2009 	Excellent Hotel in Beijing	Excellent location, close to wan fujing shopping street with famous and oldest Roastduck restaurant. The staff were bar staff were friendly. Very impressed with this hotel.	
Jun 26 2009 	Good city hotel	When we arrived we were able to check in straight away, even though it was only 8am. It meant that we had a twin room rather than a king, but it was so good to be able to get some sleep, and it set us up for the rest of the day. The room was very pleasant, and certainly not shabby, as some people have mentioned.The location is good, minutes from the main shopping area, and walking distance to the Forbidden City, about 20/30 minutes I should think. We always got distracted by the shops, which is why I'm not sure how long it took.The pool was nice, although the footbath on the way into the pool looked dirty, and you couldn't avoid it. The pool was small, but as we were still on English time(sort of) we were having a swim as it opened at 6am, and had the pool to ourselves.The breakfast was good with a lot of options, and everything was very fresh.Internet in reception was very useful, the only hotel on our holiday that provided this service. Changed money in the lobby a couple of times, and they were very helpful, letting me have a mixture of large and small notes. Mini-bar, like most hotels, stupid prices - 60 yuan for a bottle of water, surely they would make more money if they charged less, as more people would use it?Overall, good hotel, in an excellent location.	
Jun 26 2009 	A very good location if slightly worn looking appearance inside this hotel	I stayed in this hotel for 3 nights, I had chosen the Peace Hotel as it seemed very central and I was going to be doing some hardcore sightseeing whilst in Beijing.Arriving late after a flight from Kazakhstan, I jumped in a taxi at Beijing airport and after some initial confusion discovered that the locals recognise this hotel as 'Peace Hotel' and don't understand the Novotel part of the name.A huge lobby awaits, that includes 2 huge I-Mac's for free surfing, check-in was fairly quick. The layout of the hotel was quite strange and my room was in a wing that meant I had to go up one floor then walk around the top of the lobby before getting a lift to the floor I was staying on. The room itself was standard Novotel fare, although the large flat screen TV was a nice touch.The location is very good, and has a choice of 2 metro stops within a few minutes walking distance. It's also located less than a minute walk from Wangfujing St which is the main Shopping St in Beijing.It's quite possible to walk to Tianenman Square/Forbidden City, as I did on several occasions, and this will take between 10-15 minutes (depending on how hot it is!!)Overall this hotel was a great location, although the interior could do with a little bit of TLC. On my floor the hallway carpet was showing signs of an air-con water leak but the manager told me it is due to be replaced soon.	
Jun 23 2009 	Reasonable Hotel great location	The hotel was good. It was within walking distance to the Forbidden City and the shopping district. There was a subway station within 5 minute walk which meant you can get around Beijing without much problems. Downsides - the bed in my room was unyielding hard and could not get a strong wireless signal for internet access which was supposed to be free. Staff were generally very helpful.  I would stay there again.	
Jun 5 2009 	Location is important in Beijing - Novotel Peace has got it	- Number one is that the hotel is just off Wangfujing St. and its shopping, eating and crowds, and close (10-15min walk) to Tiannamen and Forbidden City. Beijing is a BIG sprawling city and so location is very important.- The hotel itself has two sides.. The lobby looks modern and there is free Internet via courtesy iMacs in the lobby. However, the rooms are old and quite shabby. The mattresses were hard and not in a good way. Its an older hotel that they have tried to spruce up with so so renovations to the rooms.- I think the location makes up for this hotel and I would ignore the rooms but I've noted this to be fair. For Beijing this is a well priced (expedia for us) hotel with a great location.	
Jun 3 2009 	Holiday Get Away	Whilst living in central China, I took my family to visit Beijing and selected the Novotel Peace hotel for our weekend stay.As with all the Novotels, in China where I have stayed, the staff were excellent and the hotel gave great value for money.	
May 26 2009 	A very pleasant stay...	We stayed for 4 nights on 15-19 May (room 1106 and 1108) and would say it was a pleasant stay at the hotel. Upon arrival, we were given suite rooms but we didn't like the idea of walking to the other wing of the hotel when we were brought to the rooms. So the reception staff was very helpful to make changes to give us executive rooms instead. Though we wished the rooms were on higher floor and non-smoking, we believed the staff had tried their best to accommodate to our request. Anyway, it was already very nice of the hotel to give us complimentary upgrade to executive rooms. Room 1106 had strong smell of smoke when we entered the room, but the housekeeping staff on duty were very helpful too, they sprayed air refresher and it helped to get rid of the smoke smell.  The concierge staff, Mr Stephen Mao, was commendable. He spoke very fluent English and helped us identify the tourist attractions which we should visit in Beijing. He also helped us to arrange for an English-speaking taxi driver to bring us to the Great Wall (Mutianyu). The free internet access at the lobby allowed us to check our e-mails and be connected with our loved ones back home. Excellent! On the whole, we enjoyed our stay at your hotel and will look forward to staying there again.	
May 25 2009 	Great for location but the room was average.	When we arrived at this hotel we thought it looked really nice, certainly the lobby and restaurant areas are. However, our room looked 'very tired'. We also found the bed very hard, it was like sleeping on the floor. In fact I even checked under the sheet to see whether there was in fact some board there as it felt like it. However, the shower in the bathroom was great with an extra large head as well as another than you can use freehand.The wing that we stayed in had a funny smell - kind of musty but I'm not sure that it was that or something else.The location was excellent, only five minutes walk from the main shopping street in Beijing. The staff were friendly and helpful. Breakfast was included in our rate and we did enjoy the selection. We didn't eat any other meals in the hotel though.There are two computers in the lobby that provide free internet but these were often in use and the internet in room is expensive.	
May 25 2009 	Great location with the style and comfort of a European hotel. All for a good value.	I couldn't beat the value for the location. I could see the Forbidden City from my window and could easily walk to Wafujing shopping district. The rooms and lobby were nice and it was a comfortable place to be as an American on his first trip to China. The staff was very nice, but there were some service oddities that I'm not sure were their fault. The line to exchange money was often 20 minutes, it was nearly impossible to hail a cab in the evening, and they nagged me about not having enough &quot;deposit&quot; even though I had given them my credit card to be charged for meals, incidentals, etc. Three criticisms: While the breakfast buffet was great, with Chinese, European and American options, it was a pricey lone option at the hotel. The Internet was free only in the highest level of rooms and in the lobby. It was $20/day in the two lower grade rooms. Oh, and the massage services were, um, less than professional.All in all, I'd stay here again easily.	
May 13 2009 	Extremely overpriced poor value with amateur/rude staff in good location	The Novotel's accommodations were the least impressive and most expensive of my 7city-3week China trip. Beijing was the last city I was visiting so I thought I would splurge on hotels and end on a high note but it fell flat. I booked an executive King room and was shocked to see that the room was extremely substandard, unimpressive, small and looked to have been decorated 25 years ago. The staff was lazy and generally unhelpful. The porter/doorman who stands outside refused to help us get a cab on a few occasions so he could smoke and talk to his buddies. Whenever you asked an employee something that involved them doing something they pretended they didn't speak english but then you would hear them speak fluent english 5 minutes later. They told the cab, after supposedly double-checking, to drop us off at the wrong area of the airport which is a HUGE problem at the Beijing airport since the terminals are so far away from each other it might as well be another airport. The thing that made me the most offended though was the restaurant/buffet. The price was absolutely ridiculous. It was so outrageous I went to look to see what they were serving, maybe I was missing out on something? Lobster and Caviar covered in gold leaf? After telling them I might be interested in eating there and wanted to see what they offer, the staff followed about a foot behind me and treated me like a criminal about to stuff food in my pocket and run out the back door. Lastly, let me mention that the hotel knew that I was just married and on my honeymoon and they did absolutely nothing to make my stay there special. Not even a congratulations. The hotel is extremely overpriced for the quality of rooms and service. I travel all over asia and this hotel cost 2 to 3 times as much as others in major cities like HK, Shanghai, etc. that were far superior in every way.	
May 13 2009 	Nice situated	I spent there 4 nights, the hotel is quite good and I suppose the price is reasonable. Wireless in restaurant for free.The breakfast you can get for extra ca 150RMB...The hotel is in very center of city, close to the Forbiden City. The shoppes are more expensive there.	
May 8 2009 	A pleasant stay	First of all, I arrived mid-afternoon from Shanghai and was surprised that at 4.30pm the room wasn't ready. I then found out that the internet in the room wasn't complimentary. I brought it to their attention that when I made the booking through Expedia.co.uk that they had phoned the hotel to check and that the hotel confirmed it was so. The receptionist, reluctantly agreed to honour this promise. I was offered a drink and asked to wait till the room was ready. They had no King size beds available and I was put in a room with 2 queen beds even though I was down for an executive room 1 bed. By the way, the queen beds looked like large singles.Nevertheless, the room was comfortable and spacious and there was a comfortable sofa to sit on. Nice floor to ceiling windows which were in need of a clean, though. I missed the bathroom I had in Shanghai and the wonderful shower at The Bund Riverside. The phone in my room was turned off which I only discovered on the last day when I asked for an early morning call and the bell boy had to come upstairs and knock on the door as I wasn't answering. Fair dues, not their fault, previous tenants must have switched it off. I chose not to eat breakfast there as it wasn't included. The man at the tour desk was very helpful and I chose to book a tour on a small bus with a small group to the Great Wall and Ming tombs which was fine.On the whole, aside from the early hiccups, it was a pleasant stay. But the moment you step out of the building be prepared to have to deal with all the soliciting and massage offers. You get used to it after a while. :)	
Apr 27 2009 	Could be better	During our stay in Beijing, we stayed in both the Novotel Peace and Novotel Xin Qiao. To be honest, I enjoyed the Xin Qiao better. The Peace building seemed to have older rooms. Until we got our upgrade to the premium floor (which is what we were supposed to have in the first place) it wasn't great. Luckily it was only one night... but I felt the regular rooms were dirty and during the night, the ventilation kept making a high pitch sound, I thought it was something in the halls but it wasn't. Breakfast at the Square near the lobby was a lot better than breakfast in the premium lounge. Way more selection, and fresher food, however, it isn't worth whatever they charge, about 125RMB or so. All in all, if you can afford it, stay in the premium suites. Cleaner, newer, free breakfast, and Happy Hour, which was great... free drinks and snacks between 6pm and 8pm. As an aside, the subway is about a 5 minute walk... not far but when compared to the Novotel Xin Qiao, Xin Qiao is steps away from the subway. If I had to choose, I would go Xin Qiao over Peace.	
Apr 25 2009 	Nice hotel in good locations	We were very happy with this hotel - not only because it had a great location but also because the rate we got as Accor Advantage members during their 3 day sales was crazy - AUD$75.00/night. The hotel was a 5 min walking to the main shopping strip of Beijing and a 5min taxi ride to the Forbidden CIty and Tia'namen Square. When we arrived, we requested a non smoking room and because there were none left we were upgraded to a suite. It was nice enough but was situated in an old part of the hotel quite a way away from reception. It was very large but a bit old and tired compared to the other part of the hotel. The buffet breakfast was fantastic - lovely food and the huge lobby had a great bar area that you could sit and watch all the comings and goings of the hotel. They also have free internet on 2 terminals near reception - a good deal. Staff were always helpful and attentive.	
Apr 24 2009 	Great Location	This hotel has everything that you could want. The staff are helpful, the rooms are comfortable, the breakfast buffet is enormous and the room service is efficient.You can book your tours at the travel desk, I would recommend that you hire a hotel car to visit the Great Wall. The cost is 600 RMB for the whole day and you can tag on a few detours that are on route.If you don't have breakfast included in your room package then it can be very expensive (£15 per person), in the shopping Mall across the road in the lower ground floor you can find a nice chinese restaurant which serves a full breakfast for around £3, they also serve great Dim Sum.Free internet in the lobby and if you are in a Club room you have internet in your room and also in the club lounge. It is worth paying he extra for a club room as you get your drinks free of charge in the evening and light snacks. The hotel bar is extremely expensive and two drinks and two small snacks came to £24 - you don't want to spend too many evenings relaxing in the bar. If you are looking for a supermarket then there is one just across the road heading towards the Hilton hotels. The shops in the hotel are very expensive and charge 10x the cost of anything you can buy outside. For clothes shoping go to Ya Show, 5 floors of fake designer goods, i-phones to Gucci hand bags. Bargain hard, things sell for 10% of the original asking price, walk away if they don't come down to your price. My daughters spent a small fortune on clothes all of it reasonabley good quality - make sure you have room in your suitaces.	
Apr 22 2009 	Great location and price	We stayed at this hotel last week for 5 nights. The hotel service was very good. Upon checking in we were given a smaller room, that didn't match the description of what we had talked about with the reservation department. We immediately went down stairs explained that we were in the wrong room, they changed our room and moved the bags immediately. The standard rooms are very small and I would not recommend them for a couple. Our room was on the 18th floor overlooking street, we enjoyed breakfast everyday on the 19th floor. It opened at 6:30am. The conceirge and front desk were helpful in providing directions, getting cabs, making dinner reservations, etc.... Everything you would expect in a big city.	
Apr 21 2009 	Great Location	Novotel Peace is an ideal place for a traveler who want to catch up with beijing after finishing his business. Located at the center of a very active shopping areas of Beijing. Also located nearby is the Food street which is bustling with local food in the evening. You get things like dog meat, fried scorpions, silk worm, snakes etc . Priced at a reasonable approx. 700 rmb per night inclusive of breakfast. Novotel peace is nothing fancy and down to business with its features and service.	
Apr 14 2009 	Great value location and service	This hotel is within walking distance of the Forbidden City and a great shopping district. Pay the extra and stay on the club level floor- it has a wonderful buffet breakfast- probably the best I have had in China. Only complaint is super hard beds. I really like a hard bed but this was like sleeping on the floor with a only a sheet underneath. Most hotels have too soft beds- this is the first one with too hard.	
Apr 14 2009 	Good location	Great location within walking distance from the forbidden city (a reasonable walk) and within close distance to the night food market (great for eating scorpions) reasonable rooms (old wing could do with some work), staff were attentive enough although their concierge weren't too suggestive. When i asked for a good Chinese restaurant outside of the hotel, he suggested the place next door. Not so good. Breakfast was excellent and almost worth the stay. Fresh ingredients!!Overall a good hotel.	
Apr 12 2009 	Perfect well located hotel	Stayed at the Novotel Peace for three nights from April 2 - 5. Clean, well-appointed, and convenient for central Beijing. For business purposes it was perfect as a well-known hotel as well as its walking distance from everything. Even Tianenmen Square and the Forbidden City are easily walkable from here is you are in good shape.Fantastic breakfast buffet! The flight crews of Air France stay here so great croissants and baguette can be had! I highly recommend this hotel for any type of travel.	
Mar 28 2009 	Excellent Value Service and Location	The staff was multilingual which was extremely helpful especially while navigating through a foreign country. While the hotel didn't have the same grandeur as the other larger hotels, it was still very pleasant. The room was a little cozy and the bed a on the firm side. As far as value, location, and service, this hotel can't be beat.	
Mar 9 2009 	Western-friendly for business and tourism	We stayed for 3 nights at the Novotel. Compared to US business hotels, the Novotel is similar in style to a nicer Hilton, Westin, Marriott, or similar &quot;brand-name&quot; hotel. (Novotel is NOT a recognized brand in the US.) Most of the staff was competent enough in English to make us languange-impaired Americans feel at ease. Location was within walking distance to a shopping mall and to some other restaurants and shops. I believe it was just outside Beijing's 2nd circle, so it was reasonably close to The Forbidden City and nearby attractions. The hotel lobby was impressive and comfortable for an afternoon libation. And the breakfast buffet was marvelous. I would see this as a great hotel for the business traveller, and a comfortable and familiar hotel for the tourist.	
Feb 12 2009 	Appreciated the spacious room with its full-length window 'wall'	I took advantage of a very good rate, about US$70 per night, to stay at this four-star hotel that I would otherwise not have splurged on at &quot;normal&quot; rates of $150+. The room I got was a double with a good view. Bathroom was well-equipped, with hot water at all times. Everything worked, and there was no damage evident anywhere in the room. It must've been recently renovated. Most of all, I loved the full-length windows that opened out onto the street, and the ample sitting space near the window with a lounge chair for resting. The in-room bar was well-stocked, albeit fairly expensive; by contrast, the room service (the burger platter I ordered was delicious and hot) was more reasonably priced, a very high quality, and had a pretty extensive Western/European menu. The hotel staff spoke English quite well, took care to answer my questions and offer help, and this holds true for the restaurant manager as well, a Frenchman who also spoke English. The location was meticulously clean. Perhaps one downside was the lack of much of a bar scene on the premises; the lounge was for little more than that: lounging, before or after a day in the field. I also think the breakfast buffet could have offered more extensive variety of hot dishes.	
Feb 2 2009 	Excellent in every way.	We stayed in this hotel for 8 nights, and had two rooms. Each room was spotless and very comfortable.The staff were without exception, very friendly and helpful.We always ate breakfast at the buffet, and it gave us a great start for our days of sightseeing or shopping.	
Jan 15 2009 	All the makings of a great stay	The Novotel is a French chain of Hotels, so you know reputation and quality are somewhat important. You walk into the large open lobby and find a friendly (and very helpful) staff that all spoke English. There was free Wifi and Apple Computers for guests use in the Lobby as well. The Hotel rooms were very spacious, clean and comfortable. Water was replenished everyday along with nice towels and bathroom supplies. Though it is inevitable you'll have to take cabs a lot, I found the location to be very good, considering how spread out and large Beijing is. It is approx. a 15 minute walk to Tian'men Sq. and 3 minute walk to one of the busiest shopping roads in the city, I believe it's called Wangfujing Road. There is a great Food market that opens at night on that road, if you are up for eating Dog, Snake, Squid, and whatever other mystery meat the vendors offer. I did not get an opportunity to try the buffet because it was rather expensive, but it did look amazing.Overall, I really enjoyed my stay and would highly recommend it to anyone traveling who is not on a very strict budget or who can find a good deal.	
Dec 31 2008 	Very central	Stayed at the Novotel Peace several times. It is a good 4 star hotel in the centre of Beijing opposite the Peninsula and close to Wangfujing shopping street. From the airport it will take you about 40min. The rooms are clean and spacious but the decor is a bit old fashioned. If you book one of the Premiere rooms you get access to the lounge. Breakfast is great and offers a big selection of Asian and European dishes. In the lobby there are two computers and guests have free access to the internet.	
Dec 15 2008 	Great Location Needs Better Maintenance	As mentioned in previous reviews, the location of this hotel cannot be beat. Easy walk to Forbidden City, shopping, restaurants, etc. But the rooms, or at least the room we had, which was booked as an upgraded room (do not recall the exact term, but a higher price than their standard room) was sadly in need of care. The room was large, the bathroom was very large, the bed was comfortable, but the carpeting was worn, the draperies were dangling off the hooks, the TV was old and got poor reception, the bathroom shower curtain was stained, the marble in the bathroom had mildew stains, the towels were small and thin. In sum, the room was shabby, and gave off an atmosphere of poor maintanence. With just a bit of work the place could be brought up in standard and to us, this speaks of poor management (how difficult can it be to put the draperies back on the hooks? to replace a shower curtain? to scrub the mildew off the bathtub caulking?) Too bad, because the hotel is so well located and has such potential, but we would not book there again unless assured that the rooms had been refurbished.	
Oct 3 2008 	Loved the Novotel Peace Beijing	We have just spent 5 days at the Novotel Peace and it was excellent, my son stayed free as he is only 15, I had read good and bad reviews but decided to stay there, the buffet breakfast was the best we have ever had, even better than the Sofitel in Xian, freshly made crepes while you wait, I had been advised to upgrade to an executive suite which we did, we had a 2 room suite with 2 tvs, my son had a rollaway bed in the other room, the only fault I could find was the bed was a bit hard, this was the only hotel we came across with free internet in the lobby, 2 large apple macs, it was great. The service was excellent, Stephen was our porter when we arrived, he speaks good english and wrote down some names for me in chinese for the taxis. we loved the Novotel Peace and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone, it was even better than the Novotel in Shanghai.	
Sep 28 2008 	give the executive floor a go	Somehow - I'm still not sure how- we ended up on the executive floor of the hotel for 5 nights during the olympics. We really enjoyed the perks of this. Private check in. You have an enormous room - although strangly a very tiny bathroom with a leaky shower screen. You have your own floor to take a bespoke breakfast with fantastic views across the city and in the same place every night between 6 - 8 they hold &quot;happy hour&quot; which is free unlimited drinks and food - very civilised. The room service is a fair price (although the food can be a bit tepid) but the buffet restaurant in my opinion is hugely overpriced. In the location you are you are right in the thick of the city so there are plenty of places to eat and right on top of the shopping centres. Nice hotel.	
Sep 28 2008	Found Peace at the Novotel Peace Beijing	I know this review is long overdue but I couldn't resist telling everyone how grand my experience had been in this hotel.My 3 colleagues and I recently had a business trip in Beijing last May 2-11, 2008. When we arrived at the hotel, I noticed some fixing going on in the entrance just in front of the revolving door. We got two rooms for a 10-day stay in the 16th floor. The receptionist told us that occupants of our room was yet to check out so if we could wait for 20 mins. Well, ok. No worries. We put all our luggages in the other room and decided to have a walk in Wangfujing which is nearby. After an hour stroll, the room was ready and with one of my colleague, we transferred our stuffs to the next room.What I liked about this hotel is the accessibilty to almost everything. It is stratgically located at the centermost part of Beijing. It is a few steps to shopping malls, fast food chains, and banks, a few minutes walk to Forbidden City and the Tiananmen Square, few minutes drive to the world famous Silk Street Market (hehehe), where we hang out nightly, few minutes to The Nest Olympic Stadium and electronic market. You should check the electronic market, guys. I bought a Sony digital camera for half the price here in the Philippines. As the Chinese salesladies say, &quot;It's cheap-ah.&quot; It is also an hour or two drive to the Great Wall in Badaling. Nice view in the lounge through the glass wall where you can see the street outside. The hotel's lobby is majestic. Very well lit,huge, feels comfortable and has a free WIFI access. The staff speaks very good English (thank God), very attentive and helpful. Thanks to the supervision of Ms. Sophie LePage. The forex is a little higher here in the concierge and they do not take a fee unlike when we exchanged money at the airport.The room was clean, spacious, cozy and comfortable. The bathroom was also nice and my favorite place, the bathtub complete with hot and cold water. They tap and shower got a very good supply of water. There were nights that the water was dirty but they inform us in advance that they were fixing some pipes and tanks. They always left a note saying what time the repair would take place and what time the water would be available. Our room was in the 16th floor so I had a pretty much good view of the city especially at night. The food. It was superb. I looked forward for the breakfast every morning at The Square. There were so many choices be it western or eastern breakfast. The breakfast was to die for. The European supervisor made us feel comfortable and always offering us coffee when he could ask his staff to do that instead. I didn't catch his name but I will include him in my photos.The staffs were great. I would like to commend the housekeeper in the 16th floor. My roommate left his wallet in his bed with all his money (US dollars and yuans). He was quite worried and had no chance to go back. When we arrived in the evening, the wallet was beside the bathroom sink. Talk about honesty. Kudos to the housekeeping staff.The not so-bad side. The picture quality of our TV was bad. There were only a few English channels to choose from. The bar was not inspected before we checked in. There were empty cans inside the fridge and some soda stains. And we found out only on our last day. We were lucky it was not charged on us. The indoor pool closes at midnight, the only time we had the chance to swim. I hope they open it whole day round.Overall, yeah, I loved it. I'm looking forward for my next visit here sometime next year.	
Sep 24 2008	Nice Hotel in a good location	The hotel is really central so location is brilliant to access the malls, forbidden city etc. Whilst there we went to the Badling section of the great wall, we hired a private taxi to do this as they wait for you. This cost us about £50 for the day, on the way we also got the chance to stop by the olympic stadium as the paralympics were on. The zoo is about 15 mins away from the hotel and costs about £2 to get in, was good to go and see the pandas. Didnt think much of the food both in the hotel and outside really but thats mainly because the food is so different to our idea of chinese food but if you are adventurous with what you eat then you wont be short of somewhere to go !! If we ever went again I would stay at this hotel, rooms were fine, clean and had everything we needed.	
Sep 17 2008 	doesnt quite live up to 4 star rating	stayed at this hotel from agent recomendation, and it doesnt quite live up to a 4 star reputation. I only had a superior room booked, so didnt expect too much, but when checking in to my room i have to say it was very dissapointing. the room just could fit a double bed, not much more, and it was dark, dank, old.i asked to change rooms, and to their credit swapped me into a twin room, bigger, even with two double beds. it had a couch, great view from 15 th floor, and was clean. about what i would expect from a 4 star hotel.breakfast was included , and for the 6 days of my stay, we ate brakfast everymorining at hotel, which is a buffet style, and is one of the best i have seen. lots of choice, all hot, fresh.hotel is in wanfujing area, and is very close to everything. you can walk to forbidden city, its close to 3 different metro stations, and is very well located. hotel has a currency exchange desk, and concierge were helpful at all times... they have their own security who were abit overbearing most of the time, stopping us 3 nighs out of 6, when coming back to hotel late at night. to check if we had a room for 2 people .. other wise a very nice place to stay, but i think 3.5 star at best	
Aug 27 2008 	Modern hotel in great location... with a few mishaps	We decided to book this hotel based on the Novotel name (consistent, mid-range quality) and location (convenient for the main attractions) and overall we were not disappointed. It was modern, felt safe, seemed well-maintained and was clean. The room was spacious and well-appointed and the staff (all of whom spoke excellent English) were very helpful.I would recommend the place subject to certain caveats:Hard bed. Our bed was mind-bogglingly hard. I personally don't have a problem with that, but it drove my wife nuts and she hardly slept the whole time we were there. Something to bear in mind.The food. The restaurant tries to do a bit of everything, food court-style, and doesn't really manage it at all.Great Wall trip. The concierge organised a car and driver to take us to the Great Wall. On a previous trip, I had just hired a taxi for the same quite inexpensively, but this time, I was lured into it by the apparent ease of the arrangement. Wrong wrong wrong. The trip was organised round the driver's schedule rather than ours and involved in addition to the Great Wall and Summer Palace that we wanted to see, several stops at jade factories and the like run by his mates that we did not want to see. The first place we played along with, but he was not amused that we did not want lunch at his friend's restaurant (we broke sandwiches) and distinctly unimpressed when he did not get a kickback from the second factory since we didn't buy anything. We were rewarded with the most dreadful driving you can imagine... we're talking narrow hilside roads, on the wrong side and when he took the key out of the ignition when we were moving to start messing with his phone... at 50mph... I had to make him stop. Not a pleasant experience, but at least the arrangement was only cash on safe arrival back at the hotel.Why do I relate this story? Well I do hold the hotel responsible for recommending this lunatic and his downright dangerous driving and interest only in &quot;commission&quot; from the unwanted stops is something that reflects badly on the hotel.The surroundings. The area in which the hotel is located has been massively re-developed in recent years and whilst it is indeed a convenient walk to Tiananmen Square for example (around 15 minutes), the surroundings lack any charm and whilst I personally didn't mind this, if you are looking for an &quot;authentic&quot; Chinese experience, you may be disappointed.	
Jul 23 2008	Good mid-range hotel - food terrible	Spent four nights at this hotel. Good location for shopping and within half an hour walking distance to the Forbidden City. There were a lot of staff but they were not overly helpful. Tried the coffee shop twice for quick meals but the food was disappointing both Chinese and Western - bland and tasteless - cheaper and better quality to be found outside. Only two English language TV channels. The rooms were clean and comfortable. Overall, a typical Novotel.	
Jul 9 2008 	Great hotel	Spent three nights at Novotel Peace Beijing, July4-7, 2008. Hotel lobby very nice and clean, front desk very helpful. Currency exchange available, also have business center. Concierge, very helpful with restaurants, tours to Great Wall and other sights. You must try Peking duck, out of this world. Rooms very clean and spacious, although carpeting and bathroom fixtures need updating. The biggest advantage for this hotel, location, location, location. Two blocks to Beijing's #1 shopping street, Wangfujing. 10 minute walk to the Forbidden City. Pearl Market and Yashow Market, short cab ride away (20 RMB). Bring extra luggage, you will need it for all your shopping. Enjoy...	
Jul 4 2008 	Good choice in central Beijing	The Novotel Peace Beijing is a nice, mid-range hotel that is reasonably priced and in a good location. The main restaurant offers an excellent buffet-style meals offering both Western and Chinese dishes, and a lot of cook-to-order items. The rooms a bit dated but are, for the most part, reasonably spacious (some rooms in the newer wing are smaller). One problem in the springtime is the hotel's air conditioning is not yet on and the rooms can be stuffy since the windows don't open (except in the newer wing).The lobby is attractive and offers free wireless internet access (internet access in the rooms is available for a daily fee).Serivce was friendly and helpful.	
Jul 2 2008	Novotel Peace Beijing Wangfujing district	Recently stayed at the Novotel in Beijing, found it to be very good. Very clean, staff spoke excellent English (and French) and were very helpful. The location is almost perfect - right next to the Wanfujing Station for easy access, plus a 10 minute walk to Tiananmen Square and the Forbidden City. It's also just across the road from a couple of shopping centers as well as many restaurants - we had Peking Duck 3 times! There's also a MacDonalds, Pizza Hut, KFC, Starbucks and a Haagen Daas if you need Western Food.There is free wireless access in the lobby, plus 2 Apple Macs were set up for free internet access as well.We stayed in a King size room which had a flat-screen TV, although with only 3 English channels. Room was large, comfortable, very clean. Shower pressure was good (I mention this because I've lost count of the showers that dribble in hotel rooms). We had a room at the back of the hotel and it was very quiet.We didn't eat in the hotel because there were plenty of places just over the road.Highly recommended, though expensive.	
May 24 2008 	nice place	We stayed there for 3 nights. The hotel has a great location, perfect breakfast, good clean room. The service could be better but it's not a 5-stars hotel, right? Be honest, I don't have complains: I had a good time.	
Apr 19 2008 	The Ideal Place to Stay in Beijing	I have to agree with all the positive comments in the previous reviews, this hotel is ideally located, is to a good standard and is reasonably priced (we were in one of the premier rooms)The concierge desk were helpful in arranging our day trip to the Great Wall, the Summer Palace and a quick look at the Olympic Stadium. They arranged for a driver to take us and stay at each location until we had finished and all for 600 Yuan (just under £50) which we paid upon return to the hotel. They also gave us some good advice about using taxi's ie how to say &quot;turn the meter on&quot; and suggested we make a note of the registration number so a complaint could be made if we felt that we had been overcharged. They also have cards with the hotel name in chinese which are useful to show taxi drivers when trying to return at the end of a long day.The breakfast was great with so much choice (including delicious cooked to order pancakes) although we felt that the buffett dinner was perhaps not quite up to the same standard and a little on the pricey side when compared to outside (but still only £60 for three of us). If you want good chinese food (confirmed by the number of locals eating there) then the Xiu Lan is excellent with the average dish costing less than £4 and the portions are generous, beer only £1 a 600ml bottle. The service was excellent and a couple of the waiters spoke a little english (out of the hotel, turn left and it is approx 100m on the left)If you are planning to go to Beijing I would recommend this hotel as an ideal base. As we were leaving they were just erecting some covering above the main entrance, we did receive a note on our last day saying that the windows are all about to be cleaned, so don't let this put you off.	
Apr 17 2008 	Does the job	Stayed for a few nights in this hotel and overall it was decent enough. Booked a double room and there were none available so we were upgraded to a suite which was appreciated. The room was spacious and unfortunately a little grubby in places but not bad. Bed was hard but I had no issues sleeping on it. The actual décor was a little 1970s; brown colour scheme (not in a classy way either) with cheap upholstery.Breakfast was buffet style and pretty good.The location was fine with a ready supply of metered taxis driving past that you could flag down. Get the hotel to write on a piece of paper where you want to go and the hotels name as well so you can get back!Booked my holiday as a package and had two days pre-booked sightseeing with a guide and driver. They were ok but we got dragged to the usual shops/factories and fed pretty poor food. For the last two days I got in touch with Sophia ([--]) an independent guide. She charges about £30 per day and is well worth it. Shell take you to see what you want, take you to proper Chinese restaurants and not drag you round shops or factories. If I had one piece of advice for tourists going to Beijing it would be drop the travel agent. Book your flights and hotel. Get a taxi from the airport (really easy, safe and cheap) and book an independent guide. Youll get so much more out of your holiday.Other than the usual tourist stuff we also visited Chuandixia village. From what I read on the internet I thought I was going to a real Chinese village off the beaten track. After a 2.5 hour drive I got to a village where farming has given way to tourism. Its pretty and the buildings are original but its all catered towards tourists and really not worth the drive. I would also recommend Beihai park. Much much quieter than the forbidden city and in my opinion more interesting.	
Apr 11 2008 	An average hotel with a nice lobby	We picked this hotel because it was close to the Wangfujing area (walk takes 10 minutes). We stayed here in April 2007. Right behind was a Hutong-like area, but it did not catered for the tourists. Around the hotel, there were places where you could buy food and provisions, and some restaurants. We saw interesting things, like a man setting up a business by the side of the road which repairs bicycles. The hotel has a very nice marbled lobby, and it was quite busy when we were there. Check-in was efficient, but when we were assigned our room, we asked if it was a non-smoking room. It was not, and it took a while to change it to a non-smoking one. Our room was OK, but light on furnishings and decor. There was one problem with the sheets, which were soiled and not washed properly. Service was as you would expect of a Novotel hotel - good. Apart from the lobby, the corridors were narrow and looked tired. Breakfast was not included with out room and was pricey for our budget, so we got ourselves fresh baked breads from a shop round the corner. We asked the porter where could we go to sample the famous Beijing duck, and he directed us to a famous restaurant chain in Beijing. We had the duck there, and it was pricey by Beijing standards. Not surprisingly, it catered for the tourists. On our last day, we found a restaurant right next to the hotel which served Beijing duck for half the price. All in all, we had a good stay at the Novotel Peace, but there were arguably better choices around.	
Apr 3 2008	Great base for seeing Bejing	Stayed at this hotel for 3 nights whilst on honeymoon in Sept'07. Our room was clean and comfy and our en-suite had a great walkin shower, which was welcomed after a hot summers day exploring the city.Lots of choice for breakfast (waffles, fruit, bacon, egg fried rice). Hotel staff very helpful and they arranged taxi's for us to make day trips easier. Good location for exploring the city itself - only a 10 minute walk from Wanfujing Street (modern shopping street). We even walked back from Tiananmen Square one day - but if you're going to do that make sure you're wearing comfy shoes!The hotel has a nice bar to unwind in of an evening - they'd often have a pianist playing - and much to my husband's delight they had their own internet cafe as well.We'd recommend this hotel for anyone looking for a good base from which to see Bejing.	
Mar 29 2008 	Terrible service and management	I stayed this hotel for my marriage anniversary trip this month. My experience was terrible though I am not sure if I was just unfortunate or the hotel's service is problematic. My room was executive room that has nice plasma TV and free access to executive lounge for breakfast and early evening snack/drink. Breakfast and snack/drink are both terrific. Further, executive room guest has two options for breakfast, either 1st floor main restaurant or 19th floor lounge. Anyone staying over three nights, having two options make breakfast experience much more enjoyable. The hotel has a terrific location too. Very easy access to Wangfujing, Tiananmen, Lama Temple and Temple of Heaven(through newly opened subway #5). Throughout Dongdan and Dongsi street (less than a quarter mile east from the hotel), travelers can find many interesting small, independent artistic shops for ethnic cloths, bags etc. Hotel facilities are somewhat outdated but acceptable. You can see that the hotel tries very hard to keep up with new facilities. Executive rooms are recently updated and have many comfortable features. Nevertheless, I would not recommend this hotel to anyone for following reasons (in order of minor to major problems).1. If you arrive, you will receive a letter that indicate variety of executive room previliges, including newspaper every morning. Strangely, they never deliver newspaper to rooms on the 18th floor. I had to complain to recieve it. 2. Do not use hotel's tour service. I went to the Great Wall and Ming Tombs through their service. A group of 6 left 30 mins after the promised departure time. After about 40mins visit to the Ming Tombs, the bus stopped by two shops wasting more than two hours. Then, we went to lunch to have the worst Chinese food in my life. Due to earlier &quot;forced&quot; visit to shops, our lunch time was less than 25 mins. Then, it went to the Great Wall. The guide gave us less than one and half hour. After busy picture taking, the bus visited another shop! - this time, a ridiculously overpriced tea shop in the middle of nowhere. When the group finished the shopping &quot;obiligations&quot;, Beijing was already full of traffic jam. The guide and driver asked me and my wife to take taxi to go back since others' hotel are located in different direction. It was gruesome even though the tour guide found a taxi and paid in advance for our return trip. From 8 am to 6:30 pm, actual cultural experiences at Ming Tombs and the Great Wall lasted less than two and half hours. Considering re-direction and others, forced shopping at three different shops costed us about four hours. For this terrible service, they charged 350 RMB p/p. For some cheap group tour (usually 150-200 RMB) to Great Wall, my experience may not be unacceptable. Nevertheless, for the price offered by the hotel, this is simply unaccetable/disgusting/ horrible experience. I strongly complained the hotel manager and offered two tickets for Peking Opera next night. The only reason I did not complain further and accepted their offer was because my wife did not want to see any disturbance during the trip. 3. The bathroom had two problems. Water drain in the shower booth did not work well sometimes (but not always). I guess it tends to flood when other rooms are using shower booth together. I sometimes had to stop the warter until it drains. Glass wall of the show booth was not fully water proof. After shower, the whole bathroom floor was wet. I complained these problems a couple of times. For the first problem, I got the answer that they could not find any problem. I suggested my theory - drain problem occurs when many rooms are using shower booth at the same time. Then, they said, &quot;we cannot control other rooms' use of shower booth.&quot; Quite compelling explanation! They never attended my second problem until I leave. 4. I booked this hotel because I believed that this hotel is eqipped with bidet (many websites listed it including expedia; someone here also mentioned it). I needed it because of medical reasons. Hence, I cancelled my original reservation at Park Plaza and booked this hotel though this hotel was about 50$/per night more expensive. I could not see a bidet in the bathroom. I went to the executive reception desk. They did not know what bidet is. After a few phone calls, the attendant explained that the hotel used to have it but not anymore. I though I was just unlucky. Two days before I leave, I went to meet an assistant manager to complain three problems I mentioned above here. At the end of the discussion, I briefly mentioned about my disappointment about unavailability of bidet in the room. The manager was surprised. He said, &quot;actually some rooms have it.&quot; I was dismayed. If some rooms have it, why they did not offer an option when I checked in? I was really furious and protested seriously then. Next morning, I met a guestroom manager to protest about this. He apologized and offered a new room. I did not take it as I did not want to pack up and move for just one night (we had some baggage). He instead offered 10% discount. That was meager considering all my troubles. But I just accepted it. My stay could have been happy-ended if my next experience did not happen (# 5)5. When I checked out, the executive floor manager said that &quot;we are giving you 10% discount because of your troubles with water drain and newspaper delivery.&quot; I replied that &quot;no, I did not receive discount because of newspaper and drain. That is because of &quot;bidet&quot;&quot;. The manager said, &quot;what is bidet?&quot; I was entirely lost. It seems people in this hotel is not communicating each other. I guess that is the source of all troubles in this hotel. Did I have to explain all over again why I was unhappy? The room rate was slightly over $200 after &quot;generous discount.&quot; I found that this hotel has a serious problem in terms of communication and management. It seems the hotel is mainly for group tourists and Air France employees anyway. It is not for an individual traveler for sure.	
Mar 6 2008 	Nice Stay	Perfectly good hotel. Handy for Forbidden City and Tiananmen SQ. We were in a premier room and it was excellent with plasma screen HUGE bed and nice robes etc. No problems. The breakfasts were good and the breakfast room was the restaurant at night. It was lacking in atmosphere at night so we went to &quot;Le Cabernet&quot; which was the French restaurant attached to the hotel and just outside to the right. Nice young French manager there and great food at a better price than the hotel restaurant. One tip if you want to go to the Great wall and the summer palace don't book a coach trip Have a word with the concierges who were really good. We had a taxi for 600 Yuan (about £40) for the day and he took us to the wall which was 1-2 hours drive away-the Mutianyu part which is less touristy than Badaling- waited while we did it all then drove us to the summer palace and again waited till we were fifnished and we paid at the hotel when we arrived back. He even took us to the Bird's nest Olympic stadium. Great experience all round.	
Feb 28 2008 	Great Hotel and Location	I just checked out of the Novotel Peace Beijing and was extremely pleased with my stay. I had booked the Executive Floor room which was well worth the additional US$20 in the price as it included free internet service, evening cocktails/appetizers and full hot breakfast in the 19th floor Club Room with expansive views of the Forbidden City looking west overy Beijing.The hotel is also extremely well situated in the heart of Beijing, 15-20 minutes walking distance to Tianamen Square and the entrance of the Forbidden City. It's also in very close proximity to the Wangfujing pedestrian shopping street. The subway is only a 5 minute walk away. Cab from the Beijing Capital Airport was only 100 RMB. Ask the information desk at the airport to write the name of the hotel in Chinese for you to give to the cab driver. It's located just outside the arrivals area.The guest rooms were amazingly well appointed and recently renovated, at least on the executive floor (17). It would have been easy to mistake this room for one at a W hotel in any other major city. Contemporary and upscale furnishings including a king bed, sofa and coffee table. As with most Asian hotels, the service was great with complimentary bathroom amenities galore, tea/coffee service, robes, slippers and turn down service. The staff even folded my clothes left on the bed when they came in for the turndown service! Cost of the rooms was very affordable for central Beijiing at only about 1100 RMB per night.The buffet restaurant does a great job at providing a nice selection of western and asian fare for about US$30 for dinner. They had a number of vegetarian options.Only a couple of minor downsides... the bed must have been one of the hardest I've ever slept on. The fitness center was not terribly large and had a limited amount of equipment for use. Smoking is permitted in the lobby area which can get a little overwhelming. Tour desk and front desk staff spoke adequate english.Look out for the very large groups of Air France crews that frequent this hotel. They move in large numbers.	
Feb 4 2008 	A Good Hotel	Chose this Hotel following reviews on this Website, was staying for a few days on a stopover from London to Sydney.I went for the Executive Suite, yet again following advice from this website. The room was great, two LCD TVs, King Size bed, Air Con the works, couldn't fault it in anyway.I used the Exec Lounge for the inc Breakfast and Evening Buffet and this was good. The only fault I would say, as with any buffet, is that if you go at the wrong time the food could be a little on the cold side.I used the concierge service downstairs to sort out a couple of days trips, they were exceptionally helpful. I think it was around £45 for a very nice car and driver for the day. If you can I would recommend getting Mr Kong, his english was excellent and he took me to a very nice authentic chinese for lunch.I used the 24 hr Restaurant as I was leaving, it was nice but not really my thing. I would recommend staying here as it was all very good. It probably lacked a little atmosphere and was very formal but if that's your thing, well fair enough.	
Jan 26 2008 	new renovation	After staying at this hotel last year I decided to book this hotel again but on the executive leve. I was not disappointed. I checked in on the 19th floor and was given a room on the 16th floor with great views. Breakfast on the executive level was very nice with plenty of food and custom ordered breakfast. Plenty of coffee, juices, fruit, pastries and chinese fare as well were available. The room was very nice with all new bathroom with rain shower and nicely appointed. Everything looks ready for the Olympics and the staff was great. I highly recommend this hotel for its location and helpful staff.	
Jan 9 2008 	Great value and Location	We booked our stay through the Accor centralized hotline, very convenient. We found our stay a pleasant one, and excellent value for money. Location is top notch, a stones throw from Wangfujing and with many taxis in the area. Certainly a better choice for tourists than the overpriced Penninsula across the road.We were upgraded, and the room (newly renovated West Wing) was excellent, very large with a separate living room/TV area, small bathroom, and adjoining big bedroom space. No lack of space, except perhaps in the cramped bathroom (no tub, only shower). The room was clean and comfortable, and probably worth more than the price paid. Breakfast was a good spread of Continental, American and some (awful) Asian dishes. The Crepe/waffle station was a highlight.Service was moderately displeasing, but not immensely so. Although we booked a twin/double room, clearly stated on our reservation, reception insisted that only bfast for one was included, the other being chargeable (which we disputed, and eventually won). Apart from that and a few other service hiccups, some staff were great, especially the taxi/bell boy and luggage service.Overall a recommended choice for value-conscious travelers.	
Dec 30 2007 	Good hotel good location good value	We loved:- the central location in Wangfujing: short walk from Forbidden City, night market, great shopping etc...- wonderful buffet breakfast with a French flair eg crepes and delicious croissants among many other stuff.- comfortable rooms, friendly staff- cheap for what you get and in comparison with similar neighboring hotels	
Dec 1 2007 	Great hotel for a great price	My stay at the Novotel Peace was great. The room was very comfortable and had a great view of Beijing. The staff were first class! Their English was great and they always willing to help. The Hotel was very clean and well maintained. The buffet breakfast was very nice and always looked fresh. The bar was also very nice with great views outside. Overall a very good hotel and when i return to Beijing in Feb 08 i will stay there again.	
Nov 25 2007 	Good location	Travelling in business I stayed four nights at this hotel. It has a good location close to Wanfujin St and within 20 min walking distance to the Tianamen/Forbidden city entrance. I got a good reception and was able to check in early (10 in the morning). My room was at the second floor and had an immaculately clean bathroom. In spite of having signs warning for the noise disturbances due to the reconstruction of the hotel nothing was heard. The view could had been more exciting but the service offered with the early check in was worth not seeing the Tianamen sq. The concierge desk was very helpful with practicalities as maps, shopping info, directions etc.The breakfast was very good and offered av variety of things.I would definitely stay here again.	
Oct 31 2007 	Regular guests	My husband and I live an hours drive from Beijing CBD. We attempt to regularly have a weekend in Beijing and the Peace Novotel is our favourite hotel. We have now stayed on five occasions and each time was a pleasant experience.Twice we were fortunate to be upgraded to lovely 17th floor suites but just the standard rooms are pleasant enough. We will continue to treat the Peace Novotel as our 'holiday home'.In order of priority, the main reasons we stay are the: cleanliness, meals, comfort, pool, staff, location, price, coffee, wine selection.	
Oct 22 2007 	Great stay in the Centre of Beijing	We wanted something in the centre of Beijing and this fitted the bill perfectly; it was a few hundred meters from the night market and the main shopping pedestrian area- this may not sound much but Beijing isnt the easiest city to walk around so having places to walk to in the evening was great. Room was quite small but nicely (and newly) fitted out and facilites were good-pool, small gym etc. Breakfast buffet was great as well. Staff were v friendly and concierge came up with great restaurant recs nearby.	
Oct 20 2007 	A Good Base	As we booked our stay through a travel agent not sure what we paid. It was called at Superior Room (Room 2202) but was very much like what we would have expected for a Standard Room (maybe they call standard rooms superior there - and then you go up to deluxe, etc) Anyway, couldn't actually fault the room. It was comfortable and clean with a good bathroom. But as it was called &quot;Superior&quot; I was disappointed at the size - not even a table and chair - and certainly no outlook. However, the Hotel itself was otherwise faultless. Right from the time we checked in all staff were most obliging - with the Conceirge staff being outstanding. As we were determined to do everything ourselves and not join any tourist groups or take on a guide, without the help of the Conceirge staff we maybe wouldn't have managed so well.As an example, we wanted to go to the Great Wall somewhere where the hoards of tourists don't go to. They arranged for a car to take us to Simatai, and our climb on the Wall there was about the highlight of our whole stay in China. Only cost 800 Yuan for a full day.The location of the hotel is spot on. We walked to Tiananmen Square and the Forbidden City, and the adjoining two gardens. Good shopping, small restaurants, the night food markets, etc. are all nearby. To go further afield, taxis are ever so cheap. The Hotel provides a card with their own name and location written in Chinese, and overleaf the names and locations of about 15 sites also in Chinese and English. Invaluable when you are out and about by yourself. The Hotel also provides a good map. Nothing seemed to be too much trouble for them.Breakfast was excellent. It took ages for the hot water to come through (sometimes 5 minutes). When it did come it was perfect. However the Hotel must have the most enormously excessive water usage because of this.Would definitely recommend this Hotel and stay there again.	
Oct 12 2007 	Very centralized hotel	Apparently, the rock bottom pre-paid rates guaranteed at accorhotels-asia.com is not a pre-pay situation. We had to pay upon check-in: bring a copy of your printed reservation with rates. Love the fact that kids eat free and b'fast selection was very extensive (most of the AF crew stay here). Bed is very firm (you can bounce coins off it). Least troublesome hotel among all the Accor brands for my entire trip. Good location and close to everything. OBTW, if you're flying into Beijing airport late, go for the hotel arranged shuttle van. No need to give unfamiliar directions to taxi drivers.	
Sep 9 2007 	Fantastic Hotel with Excellent Service	As I lone woman traveller I read many reviews of hotels in China before choosing this one. I was so pleasantly surprised by the hotel, and would highly recommend it. I was there for 4 nights, my room looked out onto the front of the hotel, I was able to open the window, and even though there was building work going on next door, the hotel advised me of this in a note left in the room. The room was clean, quite spacious, the bathroom was amazing with a huge shower and the room was always cleaned and replenished daily. English was spoken by a lot of the staff, I used the business centre twice daily and never had any problems. Breakfast was excellent, and because the hotel is used by Air France crew breakfast included French crepes. I was able to sit in the bar in the evening writing my diary and was made to feel welcome and the bar staff were extremely attentive. One evening I ate in the French restaurant attached to the hotel, and the food and service were second to none. The location of the hotel was my main reason for choosing it, walking to the Forbidden City takes about half an hour down Wangfujuing Street, the Night Market is just along from the hotel for an experience you have to see, taxis were readily available for further travel, I met with a friend in China and the hotel rang my friend for me and gained directions for the taxi driver. I would hearily recommend this hotel to others, the carpet in the corridor to my hotel was stained, but otherwise it was extremely clean, friendly, and welcoming.	
Aug 28 2007 	Good value for money	Novotel PeaceSpend 8 nights and Novotel Peace and can recommend it. Rooms are might appear a bit tired, but they are spacious, with sofa and table, toiletry articles sufficient and re-supplied daily. 2 complimetary water bottles, a/c worked well, and we could even open the window. Nice little sitting area created through couch, armchair and coffee table where we could sit in the evening. TV unfortunately offered only small selection of English channels (BBC and a Chinese channel featuring some English programs), no German channel. Bathroom appeared to be very clean and was quite spacious (separate room for shower and loo and bidet  quite practical actually!). Shower head was at a high enough position for European heights, but could unfortunately not be removed. No noise from outside in the morning.  The location is terrific, close (walking distance) to Metro, many huge shopping centers as well as Forbidden City and Tiananmen Square. There are also some restaurants further up and down from the hotel (try Qunjude Roast Duck restaurant on 9 Shuaifuyuan Hutong, [--] in small hutong next to Shopping Centre Oriental Plaza and ca. 5 min. walk from hotel). Finding a restaurant further away can turn out to be problematic, since taxi drivers do not speak English and unless you have the address of where you want to go written out in Chinese, I would not recommend attempting to communicate with the taxi driver (at least once a day one taxi driver drove us around and around the hotel, refusing to listen to what we were telling him and although he had the address  also, beware, drivers tended to approach a location that was basically in a straight line from the hotel by circling around town . luckily, taxis are still cheap). Hotel also has French restaurant next door that serves food till a little before 11 pm  pizzas were delicious and large enough for 2 people to share. With a taxi it is about 10 min. with taxi to Silk Market (if there is no traffic jam .) and costs somewhere between 1.5-2.5 Euro (depending on traffic. Pearl Market is about 2-3 Euros. When leaving these markets, avoid leaving when shops close as finding a taxi is very hard. And only use taxis with meters and beware of drivers that want to charge 20 or 30 Euro for the drive!What we enjoyed at the hotel was that the swimming pool (even if only indoor, not deep and not very beautifully decorated) stayed open until 10 pm, which made it possible to go sightseeing, shopping and out to dinner and enjoy the evening swim. Also nice that hotel provided Jacuzzi and sauna and gym (free of charge). What we disliked was that some women were swimming in their clothes and no one really cared when we reported that. In any case, the existence of the late pool must be ideal for familiesBreakfast was good, except coffee. Sadly, Chinese dishes did not state whether they were suitable for vegetarians and staff did not speak English)). Nice touch  weekends it remained open longer. The restaurant where breakfast is served was big and sunny. Also, there was a smoking section, so that should make smokers happy.Staff was very polite, and while only few people could really speak English, all efforts were made to come to understand us.Recommend this hotel to both young and older people, business travelers, families etc. Would definitely stay again.	
Aug 26 2007 	Loved the Novotel Peace	We stayed 4 nights and thought our accommodation was top class.Because Beijing prices are low compared with our home town (London, UK) we felt able to splash out on the top of the range accommodation. The top few floors are called &quot;executive&quot; and they have their own breakfast floor (with great views, 19th floor: you can see the roofs of the Forbidden City). From 6 to 8 every evening they have a Happy Hour in which you get free food and wine (mostly European food).So while we had a great time there, I must emphasise that we were in the best accommodation the hotel had to offer. There was even free internet connection (I didn't even get that in the Novotel in high tech Singapore). We had a suite, of two large rooms plus large bathroom . Everything worked fine. 18th floor and great views (not much to see, given the pollution, but that's something else...). The bed was extremely large...and extremely hard. I can imagine that bothering some people. We really enjoyed having such a firm mattress so we didn't mind.We had one evening meal at the hotel restaurant on the ground floor. The food is mostly Western and quite poor quality. There's a decent souvenir shop available too.I chose the hotel for its location. It's in walking distance of the Forbidden City. It's further to Tianeman Sq but certainly doable. We took a cab to the Temple of Heaven, as that's a bit further off. Taxis come by the hotel the whole time and are very cheap.The hotel is right by Wangfujing which is a busy pedestrianised shopping street. Very popular on Saturday night! Also close by is a food market street. I walked through the market which was thronged with Chinese early on Saturday evening. Some hideous looking &quot;foods&quot; for sale...from a Western perspective, that is. They didn't mind me taking photos.Unfortunately, there are prostitutes hanging out near the hotel. Also, Westerners are constantly being approached by young people claiming to be students, always asking &quot;how are you? Where you from?&quot; and telling you they want to practise their English. Only one pair admitted that they really were trying to coax me into going into an art gallery. It gets to be very annoying.I had decided against booking guided tours from abroad and I'm sure that saved a lot of money. We booked tours from the hotel. We went with another couple with a guide and driver to the Ming Tombs (where we remembered to ask them to take us to the Spirit Way which has the most amazing statues) and Great Wall. For a whole day's travelling it was, for us, extremely cheap. Also, we went on the Hutong Tour which takes you round living quarters of old Beijing. Excellent.A quick tip about the Forbidden City. Go to the main entrance, and when approached by an English speaking guide, ask to see their badge. Then book them for your personal tour. It's cheap and we had excellent service with the first person to appoach us. No need to book a formal guided tour with loads of people.And go to the Temple of Heaven park on Saturday morning and see the people doing tai chi and groups singing revolutionary songs together.	
Aug 18 2007	No good	This is another bad Novotel hotel. Stayed in one in Paris (Novotel Eiffel) - we should have known better. Supposedly 4 stars...what a stretch. Service is so-so. Its only saving grace is the western/asian breakfast.Bathroom was moldy - room 1306. While true that others in our group were upgraded, we were not. I am guessing that was done selectively. I will not elaborate further.	
Aug 11 2007 	Good deal I would return	I stayed at this hotel in March 2007, and found it perfect for my needs.When we first arrived we were placed in a smoking room (being from Australia I forgot that you can smoke in some hotel rooms overseas), we however asked to change to a non-smoking room and had no problems.The buffet breakfast each morning was excellent - plenty of variety and the food was fresh.The staff were quite clueless, but from my experience this quite normal in China. Don't expect them to be able to answer your queries should they deviate from the obvious, and be reminded that most of them do not speak english.The rooms were very clean and were serviced daily.We only had one problem and that was with an international phonecard, that we bought from a shop outside the hotel, to call home. The phonecard did not work on the hotel phones (the staff could not explain why and seemed surprised that it didn't work). International phonecards do not work on public phones either (they only take domestic phonecards). This resulted in us having a $50AUD phonecard that we could not use and could not return. The hotel assured us that this problem has not occured before.I suggest that if you buy a phonecard to call back home (which is much cheaper than using the hotel's rates) that you buy it from the shop in the hotel, and get them to assure you that you can return it should it not work.	
Jul 11 2007 	My wonderful stay at the Novotal Peace Beijing	This is a very tourist friendly hotel in an excellent location (walking distance to the Forbidden City). The staff is very competent (a hotel guest could not ask for better service than that provided by this hotel's staff), the deluxe room I stayed in was perfect. The tourist information in the lobby is also very helpful. I will definitely stay at this spectacular hotel again.	
Jul 9 2007	Great rooms and location shoddy service	The Novotel Peace was our first stop on a two-weeklong trip to China. The hotel has a very impressive lobby and spacious rooms. All areas in the hotel were clean and maintained, which was a relief to come back after a smoggy day in Beijing. There was much variety available at the breakfast buffet, though this it was rather overpriced. However, service is another story. The bellboy had his own agenda and tried on several occasions to persuade us to order an all-day touring taxi through him. The Business Center attendant seemed to hate her job and will make this very obvious to you on each visit. The tour to the Great Wall (Mutianyu) arranged through the hotel was small and the site did not disappoint. However, the guide babbled in the beginning and was stone-silent when we reached the site and afterwards. If you would like an informative guide, do not book tours through the Novotel Peace.	
Jul 2 2007 	Not Recommended	Stayed there for four days. Lots of problems for us. Check-in was easy and they gave us the room we requested: inter-connecting rooms and rooms with windows (after reading the reviews here!). However, upon arriving at the rooms, we found the rooms dirty and outdated. Having stayed here 4 years before when they were undergoing renovation, we wondered why the rooms are still so old. We were given one big corner room (might be the suite) and one standard room. Beds are hard. Air-con on the suite room seem to be not working at all which is a problem for hot summer days! Breakfast was a real chaos; we booked via the official site and they stated that children under 16 do not pay for breakfast. However, when we got to the breakfast restaurant, they told us that the children had to pay! The people who work there could not speak english and kept on insisting that &quot;children don't pay half price&quot; which we don't even say at all. At last we had to go back to our rooms and fetch the booking statement that we printed. The waitress then ask us to go to the receptionist! We had a row first at the receptionist, because after he saw our statement, he told us that breakfast are free if we had ordered the breakfast first from the internet. It was SO ridiculous, seeing that we had stayed at various Novotels and didn't encounter this problem. Finally when we finally had our tempers real on, he gave up and we only had to pay for the adults. By the time we got there we found that the breakfast wasn't so special at all.Overall our stay wasn't pleasing at all -- not with the hot weather with useless aircons, and our outdated room. What makes it worse is that on the day we left, we realized that there are some rooms which is already updated with modern plasma TV and stuffs.	
Jun 22 2007 	Excellent cheap and central	We thought this was a really lovely hotel. Very central, cheap, clean and comfortable. We stayed here from 3 June 07 for 4 nights.  We contacted the hotel in advance to ask for early entry to our room, which was not a problem. The staff were polite, spoke good English and helpfull. The lobby is very nice and rooms very clean.  The one thing I would comment on, is the lift is at the other side of the building, however, the bell service bring your cases so you don't need to carry them! Oh and when you first sit on the bed, it feels like a solid rock, however, we found it surprisingly comfy! The breakfasts were a bit of a hit or a miss. There was a really good selection, but I found most mornings it was cold. There were freshly made omlettes, and pancakes, however, the pancakes had usually been sitting for a while.  There was a swimming pool, however, we didn't even see it, let alone use it, so I can't comment on that. I would definately stay here again, it was a 2 min walk to the central shopping street, 5 min walk to the nearest tube &amp; 15 min walk to Forbidden City. 	
Jun 9 2007 	A rather bland hotel	We stayed at the Novotel Peace Hotel for 3nights in Apr07. The hotel lobby is probably the best feature of the entire hotel. We requested for a non-smoking floor on our on-line reservations but was given a smoking room. When we asked to have a non-smoking room, we weret told that we will have to wait for at least another 2hrs. As we have young children with us,age 6&amp;9 yrs old and having came in an overnight flight we decided to take the room. The room is spartan with a small window overlooking the delivery trucks coming to the hotel. The white linen on the sofabed had brown stains on them which one can only guess what it is! However, ouse keeping did come to change the sheets promptly. The hotel is about 12minutes walk to Wangfujing. Food at the restaurant is so so. Will we stay in this hotel again ? Most unlikely.Janet from Australia	
Jun 7 2007 	Good value and location	Our first hotel in China. We had a nice suite at a reasonable price. Located centrally near the Snack street, Forbidden City and just off Wangfujing. A short taxi ride to most sites that are too far away for walking.Helpfull staff and a great buffet, although a little pricey. Since we were not sure about what/where to eat the first few day we ate a hugh breakfast here and took an apple and banana with us for lunch.Our last day, they stored our luggage all day at no cost ontil we returned to pick it up.All in all a nice place.	
May 15 2007	No windows!	Location was good, very central. Room was awful. First room didn't have a window, we moved to a room with a blank brick wall 30cm away from the window, then moved to another room but the toilet was permanently blocked. Toilets in the lobby were also blocked, obviously a problem with the plumbing. Bed was typical Chinese - hard as a rock. I am sure there are better options in Beijing.	
Apr 26 2007 	Great location	For a four star hotel this is good value and in a great location opposite the far more expensive Peninsular. It is a walk, but quite a long walk, to the Forbidden City (take a cab)The rooms are quite comfortable. I was fortunate to be upgrade to a suite until I found that there were no windows in the suite. Seriously there were no windows but a very big suite. It was like being in a cave.The buffet breakfast is one of the best and when you book make sure it is included in your room rate. There are not many other alternatives near by.The bathrooms are a good size athough I don't understand why hotels put in rain shower heads when they limit the flow of water.	
Apr 18 2007 	Novotel in excellent location	We stayed here for 4 nights, 9 - 12 April, 2007. The staff were great, arranging for an excellent english speaking driver to take us to The Great Wall and other sites around Beijing including acrobatic and kungfu shows - which were actually very good. The hotel itself was busy, with a tourist rather than a business base. It is in an excellent location, within easy walking distance of the major shopping street, the Forbidden City, Tiananmen Square and the night food market. Taxis are easy and cheap to get for other destinations.The room we stayed in was a &quot;deluxe&quot; at CNY884.40 plus 226 for a rollaway bed [ there were 3 of us]. It was a corner room with plenty of space and a view out towards the Forbidden City. The decor was a little tired. We were told renovations were underway and we might be disturbed during the day but we never noticed anything. The bathroom was spacious but a bit dingy and rundown. It didn't matter though, we had a very happy stay and would return - unless the Peninsula Palace over the road was giving away rooms! The Regent is also close by. The breakfast buffet was very good, although expensive by Chinese restaurant criteria, but this is standard for China. I particularly liked the crepes with chocolate! The swimming pool is indoor and an adequate size with a good spa next to it.	
Apr 16 2007 	Very Decent Hotel	I had a weekend stay at the Novotel Peace Hotel. The location is quite good. It is about 5 minutes from a major pedestrian shopping district and about 20-25 minutes walk from the South Gate of the Forbidden City. The staff are nice. The lady who checked me in spoke solid English and I noticed that the person checking in beside me also had a staff member who spoke solid English. There are staff who have trouble speaking English (however, they speak more English than I speak Mandarin), but there is always someone near who works there who can assist you if you run into any trouble.The rooms are a little older and not very fancy, but they are adequate and clean. My room would not be considered a room for a romantic getaway, but as a tourist, it fit the bill completely. The washroom is also clean and the amenities provided with the washroom are decent (toothbrush, ear buds are included too). There are 2 bottles of water (~300ml each) provided as you are not recommended to use tap water in China. The hotel breakfast is excellent. A buffet of Chinese and Western food is provided. You can get fresh fruit, pancakes, french toast, toast, eggs, bacon, etc. Checkout was very simple and fast. The front desk is staffed with enough people so that the guests do not have to stay waiting that long. They also help with providing maps and directions for the local sights in Beijing.A tour desk can be found in the lobby in case you would like to sign up for a city tour or an extended tour outside the city.	
Apr 12 2007 	Good location but very old and dirty rooms	The Hotel is very well located and practically everything is accessible from there. We had problems when checking in, because theycouldn't find our reservation even with our receipt and Ref. Number..poor performance of the staff on this section. The first impressionat the lobby was great but not once we entered in our room which was old, dirty and with a terrible view of old houses's roofs. The bath was not enough clean, specially in the shower area.Heating was not working properly in the room, so it was cold. The person in charge of the Business Center, a chinese lady was very rude and lacking of customer focus. Her initial words were &quot;if you want to use Internet be aware the cost is 2 yuan ($0.25 ) per minute&quot;.The main Restaurant was good. Excellent buffets The main value of this hotel is just its location, but it doesn't have the quality service of the Novotel Hotal Chain. This is the first time we are highly dissapointed by a Novotel Hotel, and it was not cheap!	
Feb 6 2007 	Good value for money	Hotels are quite expensive in Beijing and given the good rate I got through internet booking for this hotel, the room and other amneties have been above my expectations. I had been given a standard double room in the recently renovated section and the room was comfortable. However, a problem with the shower room door proved to be a dangerous and they required me to move to another room. I was reluctant as I had only 2 more nights and they persisted and gave me a small suite at no extra cost. Overall, service was good and prices of drinks at the lobby lounge reasonable as compared to other hotels and restaurants. I had previously stayed at the Beijing Hotel at double the price and find the Novotel a much better deal.	
Jan 29 2007 	Rubbish	I stayed at this hotel for two nights at the end of a business trip before flying back to the UK. The reception and public areas were very stylish and contemporary. However, the room I was allocated was a non-renovated room and was shabby and tatty, and clearly in need of the pending renovation. I had booked a Superior Room but fail to see how the room I had booked could be so described. I wouldn't stop at this hotel again, and would not recommend it unless you have a guarantee of receiving a renovated room.	
Dec 14 2006	Get a suite deal	I booked a last minute stay for two night at the Peace hotel. I went directly to the novotel website and found that I could book a king executive suite for about $135 per night. The room on the top floor so the view was great, and the room was huge. Actually it was like two rooms, one was a large bedroom with a king bed and great furnishings, the other was a sitting area complete with couch, chairs, large tv, and a dining area that sat 6 people. I had two full bathrooms and the executive concierge lobby was down the hall. I had free snacks and drinks after 6:30, and they also set-up a breakfast in the morning. Everything was perfect. I would highly reccomend this hotel, but spend a few extra bucks and get an executive suite.	
Nov 17 2006 	Beijing's best	We stayed there in October this year and found it to be very clean, and having a large room and great facilities it was an ideal hotel for our pleasant stay in Beijing.The breakfast buffet was the best we have ever encountered in all of our travels, and the bar which faced the street, and had &quot;happy hour&quot; was a great place to unwind after a day of shopping or touring.It is also walking distance to the Forbidden City and the main shopping area as well.We have recommended it to other friends who are visiting Beijing.	
Nov 11 2006 	Loved the Novotel Peace	Great hotel in terms of both room and service. I booked the deluxe room with king bed and it came with breakfast. Cost was approximately US$100. Great breakfast, great room (big and clean) and great service from the staff. When I first checked in, the safe in the room was out of battery. I called and immediately someone was sent up to replace the batteries. At another time, the tv remote was not working and immediately after calling, a service personnel came up to check on it for me. Great buffet breakfast every morning! Furthermore the hotel was at a fabulous location, right next to shopping and eating area. 10 mins walk to forbidden city and tiananmen square.	
Nov 9 2006	Excellent location and very good room	Just back from a trip to China. Stayed at this hotel for three nights, much better than expected after reading some comments on this site. We were given a very large corner room with triple aspect windows and sofas, very well appointed and comfortable.Buffet breakfast very good.Some excellent restaurants within easy walking distance.Staff were OK but could have been a little more friendly	
Oct 22 2006	Nice lobby great buffet dumpy rooms and you'll want to know...	All the reviews about this hotel are spot on, however I feel compelled to share my experiences in doing business and traveling in China. If I can help just one person avoid some of the hassles and mistakes I have made, I will have accomplished my mission. The most important thing to remember about traveling to China is that the culture is such that honoring a reservation is a distant second to trying to get you to pay more for everything. Don't worry, they don't specifically single out the tourists-- they spend the same amount of time doing this type of thing to one another as they will you. I have booked mutiple reservations (Shanghai, Xi An, Beijing) over the course of several years and many times they have claimed to &quot;lose&quot; my reservation (even the prepaid points reservations from American Express) and I have to fight to get what I have already paid for in some instances. This hotel &quot;lost&quot; my reservation as well. The rate I had for two rooms (prepaid through American Express) was 108/ US per night. Oddly enough, they confirmed that I had paid the full price for both rooms and yet claimed to only have one room for me and a full hotel. Long story short; two calls to american express, four to the hotel and they promised to &quot;accomodate&quot; me when I arrived-- only after complaining-- a lot. When I arrived they tried to make me feel guilty about getting what I paid for by saying they had to kick some other peope out. Imagine the audacity. The rooms are only adequate. When we finally got into our rooms the second room had big stains on the carpet and the first had a broken safe. The beds are stiff as a board. You can walk to the Forbidden City in about 15-20 minutes or take a short cab ride. The hotel will arrange for a car service to take you to the great wall (ask for Ba Da Ling) for about 1200 RMB. I highly reccomend using a car service to go anywhere. Hotel in room massage often includes &quot;extra services&quot; (use your imagination) and they quoted me 180 RMB for a massage. When the person arrives, the price might double or triple so hand them a pen before they start and tell them to write the price down. General advice for traveling in China:1. Bring all of your documents of proof of reservation2. If you book through a third party (like a travel agent) and the third party gives you a confirmation number, don't assume the hotel will honor or recognize that confirmation number3. Whenever I can, I'll ask someone local to call the hotel for me and confirm. 4. If you want to arrange for a car to pick you up (highly reccomended) use VOIP to cheaply call the hotel and ask them to do it for you. 5. Be prepared to haggle for almost everything. Above all, try to keep your cool and understand that this is just part of doing business in China. Usually, if you put up a big enough fuss, they will give you what you deserve.	
Oct 4 2006 	Great Location	Having previously stayed in Beijing before I wanted a hotel that was central and the novotel was definately this. It's only about a 5 minute walk to the main shopping street and very close to all the main attractions. I stayed here twice on my holiday at the start in July and at the end of my trip in August and both times I had a great stay. Check it was quick and easy with the front desk staff talking good english. The room was large compared to other hotels and even though I had booked a standard room there was a fruit basket in my room. The hotel also provide small bottles of water in your room free of charge. The bathrooms in the standard rooms are not all that impressive and are a bit out of date but they are clean.On my second stay I arrived early in the morning (7am) and had expected to not be able to check in until later, when I asked at the front desk my room was not ready however they decided to upgrade to a suite even though I had booked a standard room. This room was awesome, it had a bedroom and connecting lounge room and the bathroom was really nice. The resturant I had breakfast two of the mornings I stayed and I can't fault the food, it was good. I'm a chef in a hotel and often examine what people serve for breakfast the novotel had a great range of foods. A chef was cooking fresh pancakes, waffles and crepes for you. Another was cooking eggs. There is a section of freshly cut fruits, traditional chinese breakfast, cereals, juices, whole fruits. It is expensive (120CNY I think) but it is worth it if you do eat alot for breakfast and the food is of a high quality.The front desk was a great deal of help and so was the bell boys and concierge. They assisted me in instructing the taxi drivers were to go, plus they have small cards with a whole list of tourist places in both english and chinese, good to give the taxi drivers.This is a hotel I would stay at again	
Sep 11 2006 	Good Location	Stayed August 30- Sept 1 2006A$230 for 3 nights ( wed thurs fri)Booked directly through hotel website as they were cheaper than all other avenues ( hotel websites, agents etc)Location-GreatFacilities-GoodStaff- PoorFound staff to be below average, the porters very pushy! I wasnt even out of the cab before the guy was trying to get me to book a car with him to go to the wall. When I said it was to expensive and I would want to check around for prices, he said he knocks off at 4pm, and if he hadnt heard from me he would come to my room! Then a few hours later another one started on at us.Reception staff were clueless, I had communicated over email several times before my arrival saying that we fly out of Beijing at 10pm on the 1st so require the room only till 6pm, so a half day rate applies. We were charged the full days rate but I didnt argue as they were kind enough to check us in at 8am on the day of arrival. When we did check out at 6pm they kept asking why we were leaving early. I handed over my frequent flyer card and the cashier said I couldnt use it as I had booked with an internet agent. I explained I booked direct with hotel. She took my number down but its yet to appear on my account....I know these things can take time so I will wait.Room was in old wing and we knew we would be getting an old room for the price we paid. Wasnt expecting a filthy bathroom though, the orange mould in the bathroom and shower was pretty horrible and easily wiped away by myself with a towel so not sure why a housekeeper couldnt do it. I have stayed in some very basic accomm in my time, but would never have expected that at a Novotel.The resturant wouldnt let us order off the menu at breakfast and insisted its buffet only and we need to order room service if we dont want buffet. We ordered continental for room service following day and several things were missing. However did order early dinner room service on day of departure and food was great, huge portions and fast service.	
Aug 29 2006 	Nice downtown location	Nice hotel in a great location. Pleasant lobby bar with good prices and good music. Terrific breakfast buffet.If the 10-15 minute walk to the major attractions is too far for you, a cab is less than $2.00 USD. Lots to do within the 10 minute walk range.Staff was very helpful in arranging tours and trip to the Great Wall.Would definitely recommend this property.	
Aug 20 2006 	Well situated but overated	We moved from the Marriott West to the Novotel because of the convenient location. The entrance to the hotel is spacious and beautiful. The people at the desk were very helpful but we could not see a room when we came to check it out. We decided to give it a try and stayed 5 nights. We were put in a room in the &quot;newer&quot; part of the hotel. The room was a good size and the beds comfortable but that's about all the positive things I can say about the room.It was very, very dirty: dark stains on the blue carpet, stains on the grey, old curtains, stains on the lamp shade, poor lighting, and broken cheap furniture.The walls also needed a serious coat of paint as they too were very dirty.The electric tea kettle was melted at the rim from the heat and I ended up with piece of pastic in my cup of tea. The bathroom was also in very poor condition. The towels were very old and the sink was chipped and had old black dirt marks.I talked to the manager and explained how surprised I was to see a room in such poor condition in a 4 star hotel. I ask her to come and see the room. She did, and she seemed very surprised when she saw all I was pointed out in the room. Within 2 hours, she called us to tells us that she was putting us in a Deluxe room on the 16th floor. The room was a bit cleaner and there was newer, more sturdy furniture,the sink in the bathroom was also chipped, but overall, we were not impressed. The best part of this hotel is the location and the food. The breakfast and dinner buffet were excellent with a large variety and good quality of food.	
Jun 29 2006	Excellent value great location great food	This was the second time I stayed there and both times were great. I rate it a standard 4-star, but at very resonable prices. The rooms are modern, clean, and large. The location is excellent; you can walk to the Forbidden City. Best of all is the amazing buffet breakfast/lunch with both western and eastern food. When we first ate there on this trip, we pigged out for two solid hours! (Mind you, we had just spent the previous three weeks in northern China and Russia.)We had a small problem where we were too close to some construction in the hotel, so we had to ask them to move us, which they did.	
Jun 1 2006	Good hotel great location!	I stayed in this hotel for 4 nights during May 2006 and really enjoyed it. My room was clean, spacious (two beds) and on the 14th floor away from the road noise outside. In fact the whole hotel was nice and quiet. Bathroom was fairly basic but the room had everything you could want. Good small pool in the hotel, with sauna etc which was again always quiet.Staff had a reasonable amount of English and the concierge were helful in finding restaurants etc. The main restaurant in the hotel had a buffet most days which I didn't fancy but the one occasion I did eat there the food was good! Someone else mentioned air crew, and they were plentiful. I think they keep the hotel going! but not a problem.You could walk to the main shopping street and some good restaurants, and in 15 minutes you could walk to the Forbidden City. Taxis are plentiful in that area, but be warned you need your destination in Chinese (the hotel has some handy cards with the main tourist locations in Chinese for you).Just down the road is the Chinese night food market - one for those who want to try something different! It's an experience! Only once did I experience hte pimps outside but a simple &quot;no&quot; got rid of them. They are everywhere in China so nothing particular to the hotel.I got a taxi from the airport which cost around 80RMB which wasn't bad but I was lucky with the traffic. In fact I got taxis around most of the city as they are cheap - never consider driving as traffic is mad!	
Apr 26 2006	over rated hotel- two levels of accomodation which they don't tell you.	.We were a party of 5 adults and had two rooms. (1 couple in one room and 3 singles in another. The couple got 'upgraded' to a superior room whilst we 3 had a triple room in the West wing. Well, the west wing rooms left a lot to be desired. Our room in the west wing was in bad condition with peeling wall paper, well worn furniture and carpet which badly need to be replaced. The whole wing was in desperate need of refurbishment to bring it up to a 3 star standard. The bathroom was old yet clean though water pressure was poor. It was a big contrast our friends (the couple) who were upgraded to a 'superior' room. Their room was what one would normally expect as a 'standard room' in a 4 star hotel- definitely not of superior standard. It was what you would expect of a NOVOTEL hotel room. Whereas our triple room in the west wing left a lot to be desired- Im surprised NOVOTEL are not embarrassed at the condition of the rooms in this wing- it is not what you would expect of a NOVOTEL and am surprised at the lack of consistency as usually when you go to a NOVOTEL hotel you know what level of standards to expect	
Apr 13 2006	Not sure it warrants 4 stars	While the common areas of this hotel are very nice, the rooms don't seem to live up to that promise. Rooms are quite basic, beds are very uncomfortable and bathrooms are very ordinary - don't even think abou taking a bath!However breakfast was very good, as was dinner the one night we ate in. The location was very good with good restaurants and shops nearby. I was there with a group of girlfriends and the location felt very safe. The hotel seemed to be used by Air France for their staff overnights, and some mornings/afternoons/evenings, we'd go to the lobby for drinks and every available (empty) table would be marked as being reserved for Air France.A large group of us arrived at the hotel at check-in time (2pm) with our luggage, and only one of the 6 rooms was available and the reception staff were pretty unsympathetic.Found reception staff and staff at the bar/coffee lounge to be rude on more than one occassion.Overall - we enjoyed our stay and would stay there again if the price was right.	
Mar 23 2006	A very good comfortable 4 star hotel	This was our first hotel on an extended tour of Beijing. We enjoyed our stay there and were very happy with the hotel. We were not expecting it to compete with the five star hotels but it offered good decent accommadations, a great breakfast and a wonderful time.Unlike the previous writer we had no problems out and about on the streets. Wangfujiang is close by and we happily ate at a local dumpling restaurant with no problems. As two women, we never felt threatened or harrassed. We looked like tourists but had no issues. There are great night food stands on Wangfujiang near the hotel - we did not eat at the stalls but it was fun to watch all the 'action'.Breakfast at the hotel was very good! Initially it didn't seem like much but we soon realized that all the hot dishes were around the chef stations along the back wall (the containers are recessed so you don't really see them). Croissants, as befitting a hotel with a French background were excellent.Our room was good, decent, clean, of a 4 star quality. Ethernet Internet Access for a fee in the rooms with a daily maximum I believe of 60RMB or 100 RMB.We enjoyed our stay there and would return there again. There are very reasonable rates when you check prices on the Internet for this hotel.	
Feb 19 2006 	Gotta be kidding	Had a conference in Beijing on Friday and decided to stay the weekend there at the Novotel. At a corporate rate of RMB650 or USD80 including breakfast, all taxes and charges, I stayed at what was supposed to be a deluxe room on the 16th floor. The room was, at best, equivalent to a three star hotel in the US, featuring quite worn carpet, a small television, an old couch and a hard but huge king size bed. The bathroom however left a lot to be desired - shower had little pressure and experienced an initial shortage of hot water. Breakfast on the other hand was quite good, especially when you stick to the western selection - fried eggs, bacon and salmon. Chinese pastries and fruit proved to be ok, not great.I think Air France and Aeroflot put their crew up at this hotel so it gets a fair share of airline thoroughfare. AS WITH EVERY SINGLE HOTEL IN CHINA, BE PREPARED TO FOB OFF PIMPS WHEN YOU ENTER AND LEAVE THE PREMISE AFTER THE SUN GOES DOWN. I did not think the location was that great, it is definitely close to the Wangfujing Pedestrian Mall but you have to walk the entire length of the Mall to get to the metro stop. AGAIN, BE PREPARED TO FOB OFF THE PIMPS.A local taxi from the hotel to the airport will set you back USD15; or USD30 if you opt for a hotel car transfer. Pick the latter, it's worth it. Beijing taxis are a complete bloody disgrace. Overall, an okay experience.
