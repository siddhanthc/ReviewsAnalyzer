Mar 15 2009 	Utter bliss in the big city	From the moment we set foot in this little gem, we were treated like royalty. From the elegant lobby to the plush rooms, everything was warm and welcoming. Great beds, beautiful decorations, great bathrooms. Breakfast buffet had something for everyone. Our only negative was the coffee in the 2nd floor breakfast room; even at opening at 6am it was bitter and tasted like it'd been cooking all night. The workout rooms, pool, and two hot tubs are awesome. Lots to do in the neighborhood; great hot pot restaurant close by. Tao Temple/Cultural Center across the street, open to the public. Stop by Yashow Market a few blocks away; much better than the Silk Market, less pushy sales people, and better prices.	
Oct 22 2008 	No better than last time	I once again stayed for the weekend and unfortunately the Hotel has dropped even further. From the moment we booked in and the reception asked if we wanted seperate rooms-even though this time I booked as Mr and Mrs beerfreind-the reception was cold and uninviting.The room - on executive floor was clean and comfortable. Room service banging on our door at 8.45 wanting to clean was not appreciated on any of the three mornings. The breakfast was average and cold. We stayed at Raffles on our previous visit and after this last effort we will return to Raffles in the future. Sad that a hotel could fall this far from grace	
May 20 2008	Better than Beijing Holiday Inns	This review is based on 5 or 6 stays at this hotel.Fine, polished (literally) lobby. Check in service is slow, writing details down manually.The best aspect of this hotel is the rooms, which are very comfortable including high quality bedding, good climate control, and fine bathrooms with excellent showers, baths and soft towels.The rooms are not completely soundproofed so if you're noise sensitive, ask for a quieter room, perhaps on a higher floor. There is some street noise outside from traffic.The coffee shop buffet at breakfast is very good (except for the coffee: so-so), but I recommend going out rather than eating the dinner buffet which is mediocre.As is usual in China, the hotel only distributes poor quality state run newspapers, but you can get real news via fast free internet connection in every room.The hotel is 15 mins. walk or 5 mins. taxi ride from Sanlitun, an evening entertainment area with a series of bars featuring live bands, some from the Philippines.All in all, this is a reasonable and comfortable hotel for a short stay in Beijing, and better than some of the branded chains.	
May 19 2008 	Five star room three star service two star food	This is a nice new modern hotel and the rooms are really comfortable and nice. However, they food is dreadful. I ordered a chicken dish for room service and they brought up something that was 3/4 hot peppers and 1/4 tiny chicken pieces wrapped around bones. I've eaten plenty of Chinese food so my problems weren't cultural. When I complained I was told that I just didn't like Chinese food. I asked for something else and they brought it up. But, they expected me to pay for the bad chicken dish. I complained that I shouldn't have to pay. The women said she would check with her manager. She called a little while later to say that &quot;just this time&quot; they would make an exception and I wouldn't have to pay. I was made to feel as if I was some crazy westerner. This is not what one expects in a five star hotel. The Internet connection here is also extraordinarily slow. I need a fast connection for work so I had to go to a nearby Internet cafe. If they could bring the service and the food up to the standards of the rooms this would be a nice hotel. For now, I say stay at the nearby Sheraton.	
May 5 2008 	OK hotel with good sized rooms but food 	I stayed at the KunTai on business and thought my room was really good; very spacious and clean with all mod cons. The things that didn't really impress me though were the food which was really quite mixed i.e. some things were delicious and others inedible and the Spa where I got an awful massage that left me quite uncomfortably sore for a few days. The hotel is really well located though for most things so as long as you avoid the Spa and eat out where possible it probably is not a dreadful choice for visiting Beijing. It is worth noting it isn't remotely 'authentic' though (just like any western chain hotel really) so if you were on holiday and wanted something a bit more 'Chinese' I wouldn't recommend it.	
Dec 29 2007 	Good	Stayed here 11 days on business.The basics here are very good: very spacious room, clean, comfortable bed, and excellent soundproofing between rooms. The bathroom was large and excellent, finished entirely in marble.The pool is very nice, but be sure to bring a bathing cap (you can buy one there, but it is very overpriced).Within a few minutes' walk are numerous restaurants, several ATMs (plus one in the lobby), a large supermarket, a Starbucks, and a clothing bazaar. The Forbidden City area is about 10 minutes West by taxi (or about 45 minutes by foot).One serious problem: the (free, wired) internet connection worked OK for Chinese sites, but varied from slow to useless for US sites. The problem appears to be with the hotel's choice of ISP, as I had no such problems from the office building across the street. There is a internet cafe one block east (I did not try it).Quibbles: most of the furniture seems to have been designed for a much smaller room. Given the size of the room, a larger desk/work area would have been appreciated. The electrical outlets are too few and too artfully hidden. My room was too hot, and the thermostat temperature setting and heat/cool switch don't do anything -- only on/off actually does what it says. You can open the window, but with Beijing pollution that isn't ideal. The plumbing fixtures look nice, but are not of the highest quality -- I had to request maintenance on them several times.	
Nov 30 2007 	Nice but room too hot	Very nice hotel, good beds and a nice buffet breakfast. My only complaint was that the air conditioning was not working, and it was too hot in the room. Fortunately the window would open, and it was fall so I could get some cool air into the room.Breakfast buffet had a good selection of Asian and Western dishes. The menu for dinner seems to have a lot of &quot;fusion dishes&quot; on it, food was good, but don't expect Chinese food here. You could listen to the TV in the bathroom, and you could control the volume. The bathroom was very luxuriously, and everything worked flawlessly. The wired Internet worked well and was very easy to get into. No extra charge for it. Landry was quick, cost was reasonable, and my clothes came back in good condition. Room safe is large enough for a laptop computer. Excellent chocolates in the downstairs lobby.Entire floors are non-smoking.	
Feb 24 2007	Good spot in Beijing	I was in Beijing for business and spent two weeks at the Kuntai Royal Hotel. It was chosen for me by my employer, but I had no complaints, especially once I discovered the breakfast buffet on the second floor, which as far as I could tell was complimentary with my room. I'm not sure if a special business rate was negotiated, but the final bill was surprisingly low for such a nice property. My only complaint was the temperature control, which mostly didn't work. I spent most of the nights with the thermostat turned way down, both windows as wide as they would go, and was still too hot. The &quot;fancy&quot; restaurant was disappointing, but the dinner buffet was reasonable, and one of the beverage options is refillable beer. Good free internet service, and the laundry service was not too expensive either.	
Nov 12 2006 	Convenient Location	Good:- The hotel is new.- Free internet.- Location is good. for shopping. A large grocery (name is WONDERFUL) is a one-minute walk away. There is a fashion mall diagonally across the hotel, and silk street bazaar is abour 3-5 minutes drive from the hotel. Easy to catch a taxi in this area, and if youre feeling adventurous, there are many buses that pass infront of the hotel as well. There is a bus stop in front of the hotel.- Breakfast is plentiful. Buffet choice of congee, wonton noodles, dimsum, fresh juices, cereals, cold cuts, fresh fruits, rice, sausages, eggs any way you want, etc etc etc. , although they serve the same things everday...- Staff is very helpful. Most can understand and speak English. - Bathroom is roomy - separate shower and bath areas. Enjoyed the bath tub. Hotel provides usual toiletries - soap, shampoo, bath gel, lotion, toothbrush, shower cap. Usual generic hotel toiletries. No bath salts or bubble bath.-Very helpful staff at the business center who helped me compose a letter in chinese.- Room not so big by asian standards. Not so good:- There are only three (3) non-smoking floors in the hotel. We were given a smoking room. Not happy with that. And the room was fully booked when we arrived due to some conference being held at the hotelso they couldnt transfer us to a non-smoking room. Good thing the room had windows. We left them open during our entire stay. - Electricity acting funny. Our lights suddenly went off in the middle of the night, probably due to some short circuit. Staff was able to fix it in 20 mins after we reported it in the morning. However some of the lamps continued to be unpredictable. Some wouldnt turn on at times. Strange.Overall had an enjoyable stay.	
Oct 27 2006 	Great Service 	I was genuinely surprised at the modern, spacious &amp; clean room. The room was made more than twice a day on some days. Hotel staffs were also extremely helpful and efficient. Most of them spoke English. The location was great too. A short walking distance (5 min) to a train station, a huge supermarket was 2 buildings away, one fashion shopping mall diagonally across the road (I think the mall's name was &quot;Yueshow&quot; Mall. Similar to &quot;Silk Market&quot;, but I found this one much cleaner, and more relaxing to shop as not as crowded!). There were also few other shopping malls around the hotel, including an upper-end mall with starbucks cafe.	
Sep 21 2006	Quite Nice	well, it's worth it. I would recomment to everyone. Most of the staff are nice and friendly.The HEALTH SPA area is quite nice and you could even ask for a massage lady to your room. You should try it	
Jul 18 2006 	Great hot in a great area	Great new hotel in an great area with lots to offer. I stayed there 10 days and loved it. Excellent service, perfectly clean, very comfortable beds, outstanding pool/gym... I only wish more of the staff spoke english. There is a latin bar/lounge arround the corner, &quot;Mojito&quot; that's very convenient ;)	
Jun 27 2006	it was perfect....	My friend and I stayed at the Kuntai for only one night at the end of May. I had booked online for a double room for approx $125CAD. Every experience with this place was fantastic. The porters and the clerks were quick, thoughtful and most importantly fluent in English. When you want to leave the hotel, there is already a line of taxi's waiting on the street. The concierge waves one over for you and translates for you where you want to go. (The silk alley - now relocated to one single building of super shopping fun, and the friendship store was only 10RMB away.)Our room was not small; however, with all the furniture in the room, which included a desk, a large armchair and the whole t.v/fridge/storage unit, the space was a little tight. Still, the linens were all crispy clean, pillows were balanced and fluffy, bathrobes were white and new. (Air conditioning was in good working order and it was quiet and comfortable.) The bathroom on the other hand was enourmous. The shower stall and the giant bathtub were separate. The decor and the dimming lights gives the right atmosphere for a relaxing soak. There were plenty of heavy towels and little knick knacks of shampoo, lotions, toothbrushes etc.. Of course, being a relatively new hotel, everything was also very clean; no sweaty pipes, moldy grout, or stained porcelin. I would recommend this hotel to everyone...	
Mar 22 2006	Nice new hotel Great bed and bathroom	Beatiful new, modern hotel. Very nice bathrooms and linens. Super comfortable bed. The room we were given (1123) was on the small size for Chinese hotel rooms. The size was comparable to an NYC room. The breakfast was ok, nothing spectacular. Business center computers are not in private rooms or cubbies. Location is convenient.	
Jan 25 2006	Good new adress in Beijing	This is a brand-new 5-star-rated hotel that is located very conveniently within the inner ring road, close to Worker's stadium and Sanlitun Lu. Subway is a 5 minute-walk away. Two fake markets, KFC... are opposite the street.Rooms are large (&gt; 40 sqm), well decorated and all of them have the same size. Very comfortable beds, marble bathroom with separate shower and tub. Few English TV channels.Try out the Spa, you'll find probably one of the biggest indoor pools in Beijing.We only tried the breakfast, which was standard Western &amp; little Chinese. Nothing special, but also nothing to complain about.Nice bar, but expensive.
