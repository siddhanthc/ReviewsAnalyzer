Nov 4 2009 	Disappointed	The hotel is out of the city centre, about 20 minutes walk to T Square. None of the taxi drivers I had knew where the hotel was - I had to show them on the map and at least 2 had to stop to ask for directions. The staff were not especially friendly or organised. The staff in the restaurant were not at all welcoming to solo travellers. For 2 nights I was sandwiched between a group of schoolgirls who spent their nights running up and down the corridor sqealing. The hotel shop is vastly overpriced - there is a grocery shop just down the road which is a lot cheaper. I'm sure there are better hotels in Beijing for the same price.	
Aug 1 2009 	good value	The hotel is a well located good a/c quality 3 star hotel, a fact that should be remembered when evaluating ratings. It is easily accessible to all the places you will want to go. Taxis are cheap as are the buses. Get the hotel to write down the name of where you want to go and take the hotel card with you. Pleasant courtyard to sit around with access to the coffee shop, but beware the price of coffee. Good breakfast in upstairs dining room - asian and american and lunch buffet for $8. There is a good massage establishment in the hotel.	
Jun 22 2009 	would look at other hotels	This is a very large hotel and caters for large groups but there are only two lifts to manage this large number of people. At peak times its very difficult to get on which is very frustrating. Most of the staff I encountered were far from friendly. My tour guide commented she received a large number of complaints from guests who stayed here. I will say though that the room was roomy and lovely and clean.	
May 31 2009 	Clean room friendly staff..satisfied	My husband and I recently stayed at the Dong Fang for 3 nights and although we cannot comment on its location--we had transportation organized for our whole stay--I must say the room was clean and provides the basic necessities. My major disappointment was the bed..I love a soft bed and unfortunately the bed was of typical Chinese form--not very soft.As for the staff, they were always smiling and always very helpful. We were content with their level of English.As for the breakfast that was included with our package, it wasn't bad..for all the health buffs, I think it could be a problem but for us it filled our stomachs before a long day of tours, no complaints!Be warned that the walls are a bit thin..was woken up at one point by some noise next door, but it didn't ruin our trip. Something to consider **wink wink**Overall, we had a pleasant stay. Have no regrets considering this was an on the spot choice without any research.	
Oct 21 2008 	Nice hotel	We stayed two nights and had a nice room, enjoyed the breakfast and also had dinner in the hotels both evenings which was nice and also affordable (we ordered off the menu which seemed to be special as most people had the buffet). The only downside is it is not easy to reach with public transport. We travelled to the nearest metro station Heping Gate station and walked down to Zhushikou East St and walked down a very small side street. To go to the airport we caught a taxi which we preordered at reception.	
Jul 15 2008 	Comfortable hotel good location	We stayed at the Dong Fang Hotel in Beijing for three nights at the beginning of a China tour. The hotel has a good continental breakfast with many choices, both Western and Asian. The coffee and the coffee shop were also quite good. The front desk was helpful and spoke enough English for us to all understand each other. We found that sitting on the beds made them seem hard, but sleeping on them was actually quite comfortable. The TV received three English-speaking channels. Money can be exchanged at the front desk, and there is also an ATM just off the lobby. We thought the best feature of this hotel was its proximity to Tianeman Square--we were able to walk there in about 30 minutes. Overall, we were pleased with the experience.	
Jun 27 2008	Loved the Dong Fang!	This was our last stop on an organized tour through Shanghai, Xi'an and finally Beijing. The rooms were comfortable and clean. The staff was very helpful and spoke enough English to successfully communicate with a diverse group of travelers who spoke heavily accented French/German/Russian/Australian/etc. English.Also, the daytime assistant manager is a handsome and charming Jet Li look-alike.Great place-will stay again!Beiing is the best!	
Mar 29 2008 	Nice New Hotel	We stayed at the Dong Fang for a couple of days as part of our tour package with the Great Wall Marathon (which was an incredible experience, I would recommend to even a non-runner). My impression was that the Dong Fang was brand new and had just opened prior to our arrival. All of the hallways smelled like new carpet and everything, from the lobby to the restraunt to the rooms, was very clean. Most of the employees were also new, working on their English phrases, but on the whole very pleasant and helpfull. After checking in, we walked from the hotel to Tiannemen Square - it was certainly not a short walk, about 30 minutes, but we enjoyed the scenery. We walked through one of the classic &quot;hutongs&quot; and a street market en route. Otherwise, your best bet is to get a cab from the hotel to the more popular sites. The location is the only possible downside. Otherwise, the lobby had a nice little bar, great authentic food at the restraunt, and the rooms were very nice with all the amenties you would expect in a modern, western-style hotel, to include the little soaps and shampoos!	
Mar 19 2008	great hotel	We stayed at the dong fang hotel in beijing mar 2008 on a organised tour round china .I was a bit concerned after reading reviews on this site so i was pleasantly suprised staff were very welcoming and registration went smoothly. We had a double room which looked like it had just being refurbed probaby due to the olympics and bathroom was of a decent size with all the usual freebies. My only dissapointment was the restaurant food it wasnt up to much but that may have been because we were in a group so had a buffet most of the time so cannot comment on indvidual meals. Downstairs in the lobby was a coffee house which was very pleasant although a little expensive for alchol. I would defineatley reccomend this hotel. Beijing itself was good if not a little drab but the pollution was terrible we all went away with sore throats. How they are going to compete in the olympics is beyond me.	
Mar 8 2008	Nice hotel a bit far out though	Nice hotel, rooms very modern &amp; clean, breakfast lovely &amp; a good choice, surrounding area is a few shops &amp; restaurants, nice coffee shop in the hotel itself. A bit far out to visit all the sights, we were in an organised tour which was great, but independantly it's a bit far out.Had a room on the 12th floor which was fab, offering lovely views over the city. Fairly quiet as high up apart from the end of Chinese New Year!!! It was fantastic &amp; we were treated to fireworkds and firecrackers all over the city!	
Feb 2 2008	Average But Nice And Friendly	This was the first hotel we stayed in as part of a trip with Voyages Jules Verne. We arrived on Friday 25th January 2008 and given a room on the 8th floor. Although this was a non-smoking room it did in fact smell slightly smokey as smoking is allowed in the corridors. The room itself was ample in size and I found the beds very comfortable. There was an in-room safe and a decent sized bathroom with powerful shower over the bathtub.The reception staff were all very polite and changing money was not a problem. Their rate was better than back home in England offering almost 14 Yuan to the pound.My only little niggle about this hotel was the fact that the staff in the bar were not consistent with their drink prices. Four gin and tonics and a small white wine cost around £16.00. Each evening a crowd of us (16 persons usually) would meet up in the bar at the end of our sight-seeing trips (usually around 9-9.30pm) and have a few drinks. What I did find annoying was that one night a bottle of beer was 20 Yuan and the next night they would charge 22 Yuan. Ok I know it's only an extra 15p but we were good customers and on average each couple would drink about 12 bottles between them so there was no need to rip us off. By the way the bar closes at Midnight.Directly across the road from the hotel is a small brothel and scantily clad girls would parade themselves in the large glass window touting for business. This was not a problem and they never came into the hotel, but if you are a prude you maybe offended. Our group consisting of various ages did'nt have a problem with this. In fact it was a talking point.It was only when we went to Shanghai during the second part of our holiday and stayed in the Jinshajiang hotel (What a joke) that I really appreciated just how nice the Dong Fang was in comparrison.I have rated this hotel a three, but it probably derserves a three and a half.	
Dec 24 2007 	Not great	We were booked here for 3 nights as part of a tour. The bed was very hard, could have slept on the floor. Bed linen and pillows smelled of smoke. Hotel staff were not friendly although the doorman was good.Room was not over clean. Buffet Breakfast was good with a range to choose from the buffet.Would not stay at this hotel again.	
Nov 25 2007	A comfortable place to stay with a good bar	this is a comfortable and clean 4 star hotel centrally located in Beijing although, given the size of the city, it's still a taxi or bus ride from the sights. Friendly staff and a pleasant coffee shop which is in an older part of the building has lots of character. Distant views from the higher floors of Beijing through the smog. There's a good variety of European and Chinese foods for breakfast and the cafe, named 1918 after the date the original part of the hotel was built, doubles as a great bar. Check the address carefully to make sure you have the right hotel as there are a few DongFang hotels as it means dynasty in Chinese.	
Oct 22 2007	great hotel exceeded our expectations!!!	This hotel was where we were booked to stay at the end of a tour and we were a bit apprehensive,but it was great, exceeded our expectations!! We were able to check in at 8am after an overnight train journey from Shanghai.Staff were helpful and friendly although not all spoke fluent. English.The room was spacious, bright and spotlessly clean.Lovely comfortable bed,very modern and clean bathroom(no bathtub, just a shower) with bed linen and towels changed and bathroom toiletries replenished daily.Breakfast was an extensive western and chinese buffet with eggs cooked to order.It was busy but well organised.Insulated jugs of tea and coffee were on the tables.Internet was available from the business centre.Coffee shop was also good.Only problem we had in Beijing was with Taxis.They didnt seem to want to take westerners!!!Other members of our group had problems as well.They would only bring you back to the hotel for a fixed rate of 40 or 50 RMB.When going into the city the hotel called taxis for us several times and the fare was metered, usually 25 to 30 RMB.What will happen in 2008 and the city is flooded with westerners there for the Olympics???? Apart from that we had a great stay.Silk Street shopping centre is great for shopping ,at night we went to Snack Street near Wangfuging Street and as well as shops, one side of the road has loads of food stalls with all sorts of food, cooked as you wait ,a great experience! If you are very brave you can try scorpion!!!!We hope to return to Beijing and would stay at The Dong Fang Hotel again.	
Jan 20 2007	Ok only	This hotel is ok. It can use a bit of updating. Somewhat clean rooms and bathrooms. Breakfast buffet was quite extensive with both western and chinese styles. Guests were allowed to smoke in the dining room. Internet access in the business center on first floor (RMB1/minute). Hotel is about 5 minutes walk to the Merry Mart Supermarket where you can get your supply of bottled water, snacks and other essentials. There are some non-legal cab drivers hanging out outside the hotel. Be sure to get one who uses the meter. It costs RMB15 to get you from the hotel to Wangfujing street (Tiananmen Sq and Forbidden City). Same vice versa. If the driver quotes you a fixed price, find another cab! They can be quite pushy. The hotel apparently does not discourage illegal cabbies from trying to get customers inside the hotel.	
Jul 6 2006	The Beijing Dong Feng Hotel	I recently stayed at the Beijing Dong Feng Hotel as part of my Exodus Adventure trip and it exceeded my expectation.The hotel has recently been refurbished. The rooms were large and comfortable. The bathroom was clean and spacious with fresh towels everyday.There was also a buffet breakfast every morning including fresh fruit, juices, eggs, sausages, toast etc and tea and coffee.The staff were friendly and it has a great location. Not far from all the main sights in Beijing. I would stay here again.	
May 29 2006	Beijing Dongfang hotel was reasonable 	Stayed in this hotel as part of a Great Wall Marathon group. All rooms being totally refurbished and while still 3 star, is good. location is a relatively short walk or a very cheap taxi to Tianemen Square. Good breakfast included in our price. Staff can speak some english.	
Mar 4 2005	Simple but ok hotel	The Dong Fang Hotel was included in my trip. Lobby is nice. Hotel rooms are simple (outdated) but clean. Employees where friendly, had no problems. Breakfast was simple (in western restaurant). Stayed for one week. Location is perfect, walk in about 30 minutes to Tiananmen Square / Forbidden city. Taxi to centrum will cost you about 1.5$ in 10 minutes from the Hotel. TV with 2 English channels (HBO and ?).Overall: Ok hotel to stay but rooms are simple, if you have a choice maybe go to a higher standard one.R.P. / Netherlands	
Dec 3 2004	Okay Hotel but hookers everywhere?!	I stayed in the Dong Fang Hotel, Beijing around a month ago (20th October) for several days. The lobby is quite decent initially and overall the hotel seems good, however on closer inspection the hotel is quite dirty, the rooms were not very nice at all. However, perhaps, since this was my first time in China, it is a typical standard there, yet for my British standard it wasn't really good enough.But by no means is it a terrible hotel, and by all means for reasonable accomadation stay there. I did have another problem which was that hookers were everywhere in the hotel, there was a so called 'Karaoke' bar from in the lobby, and a 'nightclub' no the top floor. Yet they were both quite clearly brothels, though once again perhaps this is typical in China but was slightly unerving for me.
