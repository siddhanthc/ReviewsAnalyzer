Oct 16 2009 	Don't stay here!!!	This is not a hotel. It's place that rents dirty, unsafe rooms from a receptionist with a diploma in rude. There are other comptetively priced and good hotels with a few hundred yards. Avoid the Lonsdale at all cost!!!	
Sep 24 2009	Needs a good clean	1st impression of the room was the wardrobe doors hanging off &amp; the mis-matched furniture....The room needed a huge clean. The net curtains looked like they hadnt been washed in about 5 years &amp; the room was FULL of cob webs that had gathered plenty of dust too. The room itself was a good size but poorly decorated. The bathroom 'pod' was very compact but clean. The bed sheets were also clean but in poor condition. The main light in the bedroom had no light shade &amp; you could see that the bulb had melted the bulb holder at some point...this light fused when we tried to turn it on &amp; one of the lights above the bed was also not working, this left us one small wall light to illuminate the room. On the plus side the hotel is in a fantastic location &amp; on a very quiet street. With a massive clean this hotel could be an affordable &amp; pleasant place to stay...however until it has been cleaned I wont be stopping there again.	
Sep 19 2009 	DO NOT STAY HERE - unless you want bites all over you!	I am a fairly easy going traveler - after time in Thailand with just a mattress and a fan on breeze blocks I would say that it takes a lot to upset me. I have stayed in the Lonsdale twice now - once over a year ago when I had a conference nearby for work. I didn't think it was the cleanest of places with ripped wallpaper and disgusting breakfast, but it wasn't too bad. I accidently booked it again as I had 2 meetings on Thur/ Fri this week and it was close by. This time I was given a room that smelled extremely mouldy and damp (the woman next door was coughing all night - probably the damp on her lungs). While having a lie down before dinner 2 people just walked into the room. The staff were rude and uncooperative whenever I spoke to them. The icing on the cake was that when I awoke on Friday morning I was covered in bites - all over my arms, legs and feet (some even on my face), what I hope were only bedbugs (and not fleas or scabies). I was in a rush in the morning and the woman was occupied (plus hadn't noticed the itching too much at that point) so I left the hotel to get to my meeting. When I got there I noticed all the red lumps and showed it to a colleague who said it looked awful. I got home last night, the things are itching like mad and I called the hotel. The woman had some problems understanding me as I explained the bites, then said it was nothing to do with them - I said they needed to get the room cleaned thoroughly. I asked for a manager, she said there wasn't one and put the phone down on me. I have called environmental health and intend to pursue a complaint.	
Apr 28 2009 	Great value for money great location great place to 'bed down'.	I stayed in the Lonsdale on April 25th '09. I was best man for a friend and we were celebrating his stag night so I had booked 5 rooms. I was a bit dubious about booking the Lonsdale due to the 1* reviews, but I decided to go for it as a) it was extremely cheap and b) it boasts a fantastic location.I am very glad I did book it. It is indeed in a superb location, just 3 minutes from Holborn tube and next to Russell Square in a nice street alongside some 'posh' hotels. I saw all 5 rooms we booked and all were of a reasonable standard. When I say reasonable, I mean reasonable when you are paying £60 for a room in central London Location. So, they had no nice pictures on the slightly dirty walls, the carpets weren't spotless, the paintwork could have done with a good retouch and the furniture was more suited to the 80's BUT when you are spending only an hour or so awake in the rooms per day they were great.I was also impressed with the customer service. I emailed the hotel asking about early check-in/bag storage. I recieved a phone call the next day from a nice lady telling me that she was unable to email me back but it would be fine to leave our bags in the hotel. I have had worse service from 4*+ hotels.So, I think if you're realistic and don't expect too much from a budget hotel, want just somewhere to sleep for the night you'll be more than happy with the Lonsdale.	
Jan 24 2009 	Makes Fawlty Towers look like a nice place to stay!	Some things never change!The Lonsdale makes Fawlty Towers look like a nice place to stay!My elderly mother and I stayed in this dump back in September 1984.We had what was supposed to be the “best room” in the hotel, it was in back of the kitchen with no view out the window, noisy in the morning (when one was trying to sleep) and had only a “[-]-in” sink (the toilet was down the hall and the bathtub was upstairs).Can you believe this place came with the recommendation of a travel agent!The breakfast was highly greasy and a “heart attack on a plate”, the staff proved to be arrogant and mostly unfriendly. I left my Michelin London Guide book on the bed in my room and when I returned in the evening it went “missing”, when I told the manager he made it clear he didn’t give a [-] (he was a Monty Python stereotype of the Upper Class Twit of the Year).Moreover, on our last night I returned independent of my mother around 11:00pm and rang the front door bell for the desk clerk to let me in for almost 15 minutes, finally another guest let me in (24 hour front desk is a crock). The Canadian snot that was the desk clerk then came out to demand to know what I was doing in this hotel. When I told her, I was staying there and “thank you” for coming to let me in. She told me I should have asked for another key on check-in, thanks for telling me on my last night [-]!Folks, pay a little more money and stay in a better place for what may well be an once-in-a-lifetime trip to London, this place proved depressing.	
Jan 23 2009	cheap and clean and perfect location	I stayed at Lonsdale Hotel with my relatives in May 2006; perfect location, good price (£70 pounds for 3 in 2 rooms), nice staff and great breakfast. Coming again to London for a week-end I naturally booked myself into this place (£30 single - no bath). Had a pleasant stay; I noticed, however, that breakfast was no longer served and that the owners looked depressed : is it due to all the bad reviews I discovered in a shock... ? Although modest, the place is very clean; I would definitely call again and passed the address on to some friends. martine - geneva	
Jul 28 2008 	The Lonsdale... actually a really nice place	I have travelled extensively - something like 55+ countries, and I always travel on a budget, to maximise my funds and to experience each country more 'authentically'. That being said, I shop with my eyes open, and was not expecting luxury at the Lonsdale; it was after all the absolute cheapest hotel accomodation available in London at that time. I found the hotel on-line, and booked directly with the hotel (they did not take internet bookings at that time). The room was clean, bright, not too small, the breakfast was ample, and the desk staff were most helpful. We arrived early, and they actually let us use another room to get cleaned up and changed so that we could go out and about while we waited for our room to be made up. Like in a traditional B&amp;B, there was no lift, and we did not have a toilet in our room, but then again, being realistic about what we were paying for a room in the high season in the centre of London, we did not expect these. The staff helped us with information about the neighbourhood and local transportation. Located near the British Museum, the area was lively and safe, walking distance to almost everything, and very well connected to several tube lines. All in all, I really enjoyed my stay. The money we saved, we spent on great seats for West End shows and shopping. For people who expect a large hotel chain type of experience, this is NOT for you. If you want a nice budget stay in a safe, clean and friendly hotel, try the Lonsdale. I have recommended this hotel to fellow travels with realistic expectations, and they too have enjoyed their stay.	
Jun 4 2008 	How is this place still in business?	In all my experiences of hotels all over the country I can safely say that the Lonsdale &quot;Hovel&quot; was the worst ever. Walking into the &quot;Reception&quot; - a small desk set aside in a room off the foyer with pidgeon hole rack behind for keys - I should have realised what was to come. My wife and I climbed up six flights of stairs to reach the 3rd floor after wandering through several doors as there was no indication where rooms were located. The room at first glance appeared adequate however I had to move the bedside cabinet from between the beds and push the twin beds together so that I could open the door to the &quot;en-suite&quot;. This was a 3ft x 6ft badly made plasterboard construction with a shower, washbasin and toilet crammed in. We asked for a move, mainly because of the mountainous hike but also the filthy condition of the room. We were moved to room 1 on the ground floor. Slight improvement, the fabricated &quot;en-suite&quot; was a lot cleaner but, for some reason, raised 8&quot; off the floor and the shower didn't work. The general condition of the room was shabby with filthy curtains and broken light fittings and broken windows. Disgusting.	
Apr 28 2008 	Disgusting and dirty	Small rooms equipped in the old, ruined furniture look as never been cleaned up. Windows that cannot be neither opened nor closed. Bad air everywhere. Toilets are the worst - dirty and ruined as well. Service below expectations - long queues for breakfast. If you need a cup or plate you should ask - nobody from the hotel notices it. Food so bad as you immediately dream to be on diet. The only advantage of Lonsdale is location - close to British Museum, in the heart of London. But if you prefer to stay in nice, clean hotel better choose the other one. 4 other hotels are located on the same street as Lonsdale	
Mar 3 2008 	Horrible horrible horrible	Without a doubt the worst hotel I have ever seen.My two friends from Italy booked in here for 3 nights. After the first night when they had dirty sheets, found cigarette butts in the drawers and no curtains on the windows I came over to rescue them. The floors were filthy, the stairs filled with dust, the furniture broken and the breakfast only offered between 8am and 9.30am (though I imagine you would be taking your life in your hands to eat it!)The receptionists were completely unhelpful and only gave a partial refund under extreme duress. I will be calling Trading Standards and Camden Council to report this hotel. It is horrendous and I wouldn't house my dog in it.Beware!!!!	
Jan 30 2008 	Don´t go to this... hotel?	Dirty, old, abandoned hotel.Small room, dirty walls, no light in the WC of the corridor...The fotos they show in the webs are simply false. The breakfast is very bad: no hot milk, even if you ask for it (they answered me: only cold milk!!)Please, if you don´t want to stay at a dirty hole, please don´t go.	
Jan 21 2008 	Very poor	First of all, the Lonsdale has a good location, in a nice part of London and close to the centre. We stayed for one night after coming down from the Midlands to see a musical in the West End and it was very convenient for that. That, however, is one of the few good things you can say about it. The staff was generally surly and uncommunicative and entirely foreign - some spoke very poor English. The first room we were given had no headboards on the bed and stank of stale cigarette smoke - despite our requesting a non-smoking room. The second room was very hot (radiators on full and no way of turning them down) and the light in the bathroom didn't work. We were assured that this would be fixed, and in all fairness both were fixed quickly. However, although the radiators were off the room remained very warm; it was not a cold night and we had to have the window wide open all night, which made it rather noisy. The furniture and fittings were barely adequate - many items were cracked, old and poorly maintained. The carpets were shabby and frayed. The 'ensuite bathroom' was a cabinet installed in one corner of the room and while clean enough was very cramped; there was hot water, as long as you worked out that the shower had to be turned towards the cold end to get hot! The room wasn't too dirty, but could certainly have been better. The television worked, but wasn't tuned into any stations. Breakfast was adequate (bacon, sausages, fried eggs, toast, orange juice, tea), but kept running out and had to be replenished (slowly) by very surly kitchen staff. There was only one flavour of jam and no sauces at all. All in all, not a particularly pleasant experience and I'm glad we only stayed one night - I certainly wouldn't have stayed any more. £75 per night may be cheap for London, but it is still not exactly cheap and I expect much more for my money. I have stayed in many (much, much cheaper) hostels in major European cities, and I have to say that this 'hotel' was far worse than any of them. Not recommended at all.	
Jan 3 2008 	Lonsdale Hotel + Cheaper rates = Horrible Stay	The Lonsdale hotel = horrible accomodation, I am a Soldier and have been deployed numerous times and know what it is like to &quot;rough it&quot;. But the fact is that I paid for this accomodation. The bathrooms were disgusting, asif they were never cleaned, the sink inside the bedroom was horrible, there was a huge clump of hair stuck in the drain with what appeared to be a dead cockroach. When I notified the front desk, they said that they would take care of it, but int the three days I was with them, they never did. To top things off, the receptionist couldn't speak English. She couldn't even give directions from the nearest tube station. God forbid that there are any problems (ie, hair clogged sink) because she won't understand you. I will never stay here again and emplore others not to as well. My advice is to stay in the Kings Cross area and take the tube to your destination.	
Dec 8 2007 	too expensive!	We stayed here for 60pounds/night. We booked a double room, but the room had a double and a single, so the room was completely filled up! The room was shabby, and the bathroom was very small. And the water temperature was not stable at all. Yes, 60pounds for a double room is kind of cheap if I consider it is London, but still, it does not worth paying. Look for other hotels!	
Nov 30 2007 	could be better?	Was booked at gresham hotel but because of problems moved to lonsdale hotel, not very impressed with it.Some good points, warm rooms, friendly'ish staff and plenty of hot water and not a bad breakfast. Bad points, in need of a good clean, sink was badly cracked and no plug ,shower was very dirty so would'nt use it and no tea, coffee or kettle as they advertise on their website I suppose at the end of the day you get what you pay for but would not recomend it to anyone i'm afraid which is a shame because it's location is'nt bad.	
May 12 2007	Doss House	Absolute nightmare. A Doss House and a real dive. Had a cracked sink in my room, if you would have run your fingers across it you'd have sliced your fingers off. Despite paying for two weeks accommodation, I went home for the weekend to return on the Sunday to find my room had been let out for the Saturday night. Everything I'd left in the room ended up in a plastic bag in reception and the laptop I'd hidden away in the wardrobe was gone.Hotel manager turns up for one hour every day (apparently) but you can never get hold of her. Even the police had trouble getting in touch with her.Stay clear.	
Apr 10 2007 	Not that bad after all...	I was a bit worried about the hotel after reading the reviews. BUT it’s not so bad…Yes it’s like a hostel…so what? We got a twin room for £150 for three nights (during a bank holiday weekend). It’s good value considering the location. Far more cheaper than everything else in a central location. The room had all the basics and it was clean. It looked like there was a bit of refurbishment going on around the hotel , so hopefully they will improve the rooms in the near future… Do not book this hotel if you’re looking for a posh place to impress your girlfriend… Book this hotel if you just want a place to crash and if you plan to budget on the accommodation, considering everything else is expensive in London (eg. restaurants, museums, clubs…).	
Sep 29 2006 	The worst hotel I have ever stayed in...	The staff were surly, rude, unpleasant and unhelpful.The room was dirty, the bathroom tiny and the furniture looked as though it had been bought in a 1950s church jumble sale...actually that's an exageration, no one would have had the nerve to charge money for such a pile of junk! The curtains were dirty and ill-fitting. The towels were very very old. The TV was tiny and only had 3 channels. There was no radio. There was no chair in the room, so the only place to sit was on the bed. The view from the window was over a depressing courtyard that contained a broken washing machine.the breakfast was served by someone even ruder than the receptionist and consisted of greasy burnt sausages, undercooked bacon and congealed fried eggs. I can't tell you about the scrambled eggs, as the dish was empty by the time I got there. The cornflakes were soft, and looked like they had been lying out for some considerable time . The drink on offer was orange squash!Do not stay here, pay a few quid more and get somewhere clean and friendly	
Aug 19 2006	Quirky-chic Lonsdale	This hotel is another shabby, but decent, foreign-run &quot;youth hotel&quot; in London.The staff is very casual, standoffish, and could be considered a bit rude by some.The breakfast is scant, but it's there.The price is average, and the value is decent for the location. 40 pounds a night for a single, that's without any deals or booking ahead.The room itself is kind of cute. There are neon rods that illuminate the corners of the room well. The bed is big enough, the TV and fan are junky, but they work sort of.The bathrooms are not bad.	
Jun 2 2006	Not all that bad	I stayed here for one night at the beginning of June. We were in London for a friend's birthday and knowing how expensive London clubs/bars/restaurants are we budgeted on the hotel. The Lonsdale is the cheapest for miles around and has a great location, just near the gorgeous Russel Square, a stone's throw from Euston, Leicester square, Covent Garden and Oxford Street. The staff were neither polite nor rude, they were just quiet. The room was clean and basic, and at £75 for a triple very reasonable. The bathroom was a big disappoinment, more like an aeroplane toilet with a shower added on, and about the size of most people's bath mats. However everything worked, it was clean and reasonably comfortable and cheap. Not recommended if you're trying to impress anyone, but great for students on a budget who want a night out and great shopping more than a hotel.	
May 16 2006	Poor hotel	I stayed at this hotel with my wife and Mother during the London Marathon in April. I'm generally not too fussy as long as the place is generally clean and well run. Unfortunately the Lonsdale hotel is neither of these things and I couldn’t really recommend it to anyone other than on the grounds that it is relatively cheap and has a good location to Oxford street etc. The carpets are old and frayed, the furniture shoddy, one member of staff serving breakfast and constantly running out of things. It also took a member of staff 10 minutes to open the door of our room because the lock was old. I would have moved to another hotel if we were planning a longer stay and definitely won't be staying again.	
Mar 22 2006 	oh my god	this has to be the worst hotel i have ever been to, to say it was smelly and dirty is an understatement! we were booked in for three nights but after one very sleepless night had to leave even though our business check had already cleared, it looks to me as a hostel would look. DO NOT under any circumstances stay here !!!	
Feb 13 2006	Do not go here	I have just seen this hotel on a consumer watchdog programme on BBC1.The hotel looks pleasant from the outoside and the rooms basic.A health standards officer carried out checks on the room only to find it brimming with harmful bacterial.Worst part is that a piece of excrement was found on the ceiling of the bathroom.I will leave it there.	
May 23 2005	oh my lordie	If y ou don't mind sharing a bathroom or having your own portapotty in your room, well then lonsdale is the place for you. the constant urine smell and dirty towels are an added bonus. the staff is fantastic, charging for phone calls that are local and should be included. but whats even better was the struggle to make a phone call. you have to ask them to use the line which isn't easy because half the time you can't even communicate with them. i think the bed gave me a rash and oh my those rooms aren't spacious at all. every night it sounded like there was a herd of elephants coming down the stairs... whata dumpoverall... i hated it. i expected at LEAST clean towels. if your staying here... bring your own towels.	
Feb 28 2005	Expect a basic Bed 	If you want a Hotel stay away. Well, what can I say...a weekend in London planned and we booked in here for two nights. Arrived late on Friday evening to find out that out double en-suite room was in fact a double room, with a shower cubicle within the room and a shared toilet along the corridor. The carpet was terrible - looked like it had been scrateched by a cat, the furniture was very basic and very shabby. The bedspread was threadbare, the decor in desperate need, oh and one towel between two of us. In normal circumstances I would have asked for an additional towel and asked about their understanding of the word 'ensuite', but the shock and horror of seeing the room just overcame us. Things were so bad, we were nervous about taking our shoes off....the only thing we could think was that we wouldn't be staying the two nights that we had paid for....but we were just too tired to do anything about it there and then.On the positive side, the bed linen was very clean and the bed very comfortable, but the moment we woke, we washed and went on the serach of new accomodation....at any price! We skipped breakfast at the 'hotel' and ate in a lovely cafe in Russell Square. After asking around at a few hotels, everywhere seemed fully booked, but one hotel booked us in at a hotel in the City (not really where we wanted to be, but anywhere, anywhere was better than another night at the Lonsdate!!), back to the Lonsdale, collected our bags and ran to the nearest tube station. We felt like two school children running away!!! It was so dire that we didn't even stop to ask for our money back for the second night, the relief of knowing we could stay somewhere else was so enormous!!Once across town, we checked into a fab hotel and immediately showered and changed....Saturday morning all but over, but the rest of the weekend was excellent, however, without a sense of humour and the cash to book somewhere else, it could have been a right disaster!My advice - if you're looking for a Bed and Breakfast that you are willing to pay over the top for, then this is the place, but don't believe what you see when you look at the booking options....I am sure with a lick of paint and some decent furniture this could be an OK place, but if its a cheap hotel you're after you'll get far better value for money at a Travelodge or Travel Inn and at least you know what you're getting.	
Feb 11 2005	B Y F A R T H E W O R S T H O T E L I ' V E E V E R B E E N I N	I wish I'd found this web site and read these reviews BEFORE I stopped in this sorry excuse for a Hotel.  But even I had, I probably wouldn't have believed it could be as bad as other reviewers have said. Having stayed there, I now realise they were being kind:  1) The foyer is a bit scruffy. 2) The person who checked us in smelt of . 3) Having already got suspicous, I asked to see the room before I checked in and paid. Unfortunately, I didn't stand my ground, figuring I could always get my money back if it was to awful. DO NOT DO THIS - THEY WILL NOT GIVE A REFUND. 4) As we walked up to the room up the filthy, and I mean FILTHY, carpets the smell of damp increased our foreboding. Mess lay around, cupboard doors standing open etc. Surely the room must be an improvement, we prayed... 5) We were in London for a Valentines weekend, but were given a twin room, having booked a double. First night ruined as they couldn't move us until the next day. 6) Carpet unbelievably dirty. 7) Hot water didn't work propelry. 8) TV remote had no batteries in. 9) Light was broken. 10) Blankets were clean but of really crap quality. 11) Toilet seat was broken off. 12) Furniture looked like it was from a jumble sale, mismatched, cheap and ancient. 13) I refused to eat the breakfast - if a hotel cares this little for the cleanliness of its rooms, what is the kitchen and food going to be like... 14) Asked for my money back the next morning, they refused, I left anyway.   I am now in a quite brilliant hotel called the Crestfield up near Kings Cross - friendly staff, clean rooms, bar AND, TO SHUT THE &quot;WHAT DO YOU EXPECT FOR £X&quot; SQUAD UP, THE CRESTFIELD IS CHEAPER!! There are may hotels in London as cheap of this, NONE are as bad as this one.  Just don't do it, is all I can add. 	
Jan 5 2005 	Think again	This hotel is not worthy of the 3* rating. We changed rooms three times before finding something acceptable. If we hadn't been working in the area we would have checked out on day one. The reception consisted of 'fill in this form and give me your card details' not even hello! The first room had wall paper peeling off the walls - the second room had a gale force draught through the window and no central heating (the radiator was falling off the wall!) Finally we took a room with cupboard doors falling off - cracked sink and a very unsafe electrical socket. The hotel is in a good location - in my opinion pay a bit more and avoid a bad experience.	
Jan 4 2005	Avoid the Lonsdale	My husband and I spent our entire time at the Lonsdale trying to get out! The room was generally dirty, the shower trickled (which was good, I suppose, because the drain was so slow it couldn't have drained more than a trickle), and the soap had been used and had hairs imbedded in it. The carpet looked like it hadn't been vacuumed -- ever. Breakfast was grossly unappetizing. All in all, it was probably the worst place we've ever stayed. The only good thing about it was the location, but even that was marred by the poor woman who appeared to be sleeping on the stoop next door and who yelled obscenities as us every time we walked by. My advice? Avoid the Lonsdale.	
Dec 6 2004	tricksters	These people took our money and then bluntly told us we had been moved to its sister hotel, no apology just an order!. The hotel we were moved to was the GRESHAM. Purfect location for Oxford Street, theatres etc if you dont mind living like a rat for the night. Best only stayed at if youre desperate for a room. I think I'll be paying a bit more in future.	
Nov 25 2004	Worst Hotel in the World?	I cannot stress quite how awful this place is. If you look you will see that there are many bad reviews about this place. I urge you to read all of these before you make a decision to book a room at the Lonsdale. Colleagues of mine stayed here and listed a catalogue of reasons not to stay: fleas in the beds, decrepid furniture, porta-loo-toilets!, ridiculously poor breakfast, strange smells in the rooms, etc. Furthermore, they were concerned about the other &quot;guests&quot;, who appeared to be treating the place as a doss-house. All in all, this did not add up to a pleasant experience and they only managed a couple of hours sleep. NOT what you want for accommodation.	
Oct 15 2004	hotel from hell!!	never have we stayed anywhere like this. I don't know how it has the nerve to call itself a hotel. Dirty, and could someone please tell me where the lounge is to relax and meet up with friends?? I understand that you don't expect the Ritz for £45 per night, but cleanliness and friendly staff must count for something. No breakfast the next morning because the &quot;dining room&quot; was too small to seat everyone and the food was cooked just on an ordinary cooker ie one egg at a time, and the place was full. It is obvious that the owners of this just want to make a profit out of people and are not concerned about their well being.	
Oct 13 2004 	It's OK! What do you expect for £40?!	I only came across these reviews after booking the hotel online, and reading these reviews made me want to cancel. But - it was too late, and now I am staying there, I am glad I didn't cancel! The staff are really friendly and helpful, and it isn't the cesspit people are making it out to be.It's what you'd expect for £40 in Central London. A decent sized comfy bed, a kettle, a television, ample storage space. I didn't go for an ensuite, I went for a basic, which still has a sink in the room so you can freshen up if you want to - the shared showers and toilet are clean, and there's plenty of others to use if one is busy.A buffet breakfast is included, you can choose from basic items in an English breakfast - sausage, bacon, eggs, tomato with toast - or there's cornflakes and fruit available. Breakfast is served with tea, coffee or orange juice. The room is QUIET, which is a real blessing, and there's a heater which means you control the temperature of the room. True, the windows don't have locks on, but all rooms are on the first floor and upward, and they're the old fashioned 'lift up' windows which are nigh-on-impossible to get into from the outside and the doors have inside deadlocks. True, the decor isn't amazing, but what did you expect? The Malmaison?If you haven't booked already - don't be put off by the reviews, and maybe take a wander down Bedford Street before deciding where to stay. There are 7 or 8 other B&amp;Bs down the same road and one of them is bound to have vacancies. If you like to have things firmed up in advance, then book into here for one night, then check out the other hotels once you get here. Don't expect the world; if you want something nicer, go and pay more money. If you just want a place to lay your head down at night, or do some reading and writing in the evening, you may just have found your base.	
Aug 25 2004	Absolute rogues	These rogues are trying to charge a 50 pound cancellation fee for an online booking cancelled more than ONE month prior to the date of arrival! Their cancellation policy says a fee will be charged if a booking is cancelled two days before arrival. If this is the way they run their business they deserve none!	
Aug 9 2004	Charming!	The Lonsdale is lovely! The location is very convenient to walking to the underground. When we walked down Bedford Place we'd sing &quot;On the Street Where You Live&quot; because it was just like &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;. The room was small, but, for the price, it was nice. The breakfasts were very good. This was a charming place to stay and a great experience.	
Jul 29 2004	Be happy - stay away !	Just think of it, plumming that keeps you up all night, breakfest that looks like it have stayed up all night.Use a few pounds more and get a decent hotell !	
Jul 28 2004	For the price ...	I took a party of 21 French adults (all professionals ranging from 27-60years) to this hotel. After having reserved the rooms (for 25pounds a head a night) I read the reviews here and was very worried, I called the hotel to see if I could get the group the better rooms.On arrival we were met by Javid (?) and he was incredibly courteous. I inspected each of the booked 8 rooms whilst the party checked in. The linen was clean, the floors vacuumed. The showers in some rooms were on the small side, the furniture is from the 70's but generally functioned and only one room I was unhappy with was the basement one (I think 27). Each room was cramped, a bed could have been taken to make more space.However, this is CENTRAL LONDON, you get what you pay for - it's a cheap, very cheap hotel and clean. A bit confusing in it's layout with two staircases and endless corridors.The group were VERY impressed with the locality, cleanliness (having been warned) and the breakfast was apparently fantastic. For 25pounds which over 3 nights converted to 100euros for B&amp;B they all agreed that they'd go back to the Lonsdale for a short break despite the crampness of the rooms.	
Jul 26 2004	Not good enough for animals fleas	I was horrified that this was classed as a 3*hotel. The room i booked was supposed to be a double bed en-suite. Not enough room to swing a cat. Never in my wildest dreams would have i have ever stayed in a dull, damp smelly pre-war furnished room with an equivelent to a porta loo/sink/shower found on a camp site. If only i had read the reviews before booking on-line. My husband and i had theatre tickets for 7.30pm on the night we arrived, he was at his office in Covent garden all day and i had walked around in the heat and smog of London so a shower was definately needed before leaving for our show.I entered the shower and began washing my hair in cool water slowly it warmed up and up and up until i was scolded, not having been able to turn the cold water on, i wrapped my lathered hair in a towel and called reception to be told that i DID NOT TELL THEM WHEN I ARRIVED BACK THAT I WAS GOING TO HAVE A SHOWER....since when do you have to inform all and sundry that your going to have a shower. Due to plumbing work in the hotel they did not know when the cold water would be back on. A few minutes after my call to reception the proprieter brought me a bucket of cold water for me to rinse my hair. Did i mention pre-war before?. When my husband returned from work at 6.30pm we still had no cold water. When we arrived back later that evening the porta loo was flooded due to the cold water tap being left partially on...oops. After cleaning up the flood we went to bed having kicked off the smelly old blankets.Breakfast was at 8 am until 9.30am, after a very uncomfortable night we went to breakfast at 8.15am, to find that nothing was left. My husband poored me a coffee which tasted vile and after listening to the girl for 20 mins chatting in the kitchen she eventually arrived with some toast.I asked if more breakfast was on its way to this she rudely said &quot;in a minute&quot;. I could not stand another minute in this place so we left and ate breakfast in a cafe in town. As a British person i am ashamed that tourist from all over the world could be subjected to such conditions in one of our hotels	
Jul 5 2004	Great Little Hotel	Stayed at the Lonsdale with a group of girlfriends and though it was great. Although it does have a few problems (the breakfast wasn't very good and the en-suite was quite compact!!) I thought it was great! It is very near to the heart of London and all the tourist attractions and theatres and was only a 5 minute walk from the tube station. The area where it is situated is also very good with plenty of nice bars and restaurants just around the corner. The lady on reception could not have been nicer and let us leave our bags on the last day after we had checked out, so we did not have to trail them about. I advise you stay here if you are in London for a fun weekend with a group of friends and are not expecting too much (really, what do you expect for £30 a night!!?)	
Jun 12 2004	wouldnt let my dog stay here	What a dump! Just had one night here as a 'break' for me and my wife! an absolute nightmare! A **** room in a **** hotel with **** or no facilities. We booked an ensuite and didnt get one. We booked a double and didnt get one. We wanted a refund for being misled by pics on internet and for not getting what we'd asked for and guess what, we didnt get one! All this rubbish about 'being open minded' and 'dont think like an american when you stay' on a previous review, ..humans shouldnt be allowed to stay here and theres no English character, charm or benefits in staying in a dump, even if the locations good. Keep looking, plenty of good hotels in London	
Apr 13 2004	D E V I L `S P L A C E	All I have read about this so called hotel is not true - this place is worse, it is &quot;The Devil`s Place&quot;: disgusting, horrible, filthy, dirty, ugly, terrible ............. and there is no refund if you will leave earlier. &quot;Mind the flop!&quot;	
Feb 27 2004	5 star dump	Well i wish i had read these reviews before i booked. When i entered the hotel it looked very run down and basic but it wasnt until i had payed in full for my stay and had been showed to my room that the shock had hit home. The room was a dirty ******** it can't have been cleaned for years, It was total mish mash of old tacky furniture that had been painted and was falling apart, I can't belive how this hotel meets heath and saftey regulations!! with its smell,dodgy lighting and the poor washroom faciltys.DON'T STAY AT THE LONSDALE HOEL	
Feb 26 2004	Can't think like an American	Ok call me insane but I've actually stayed at this hotel a total of 3 times. Hey it was cheap it was the exact location I wanted to be in and I was going with a couple of girlfriends to drink and go clubbing. What did we care if the room was small? First of all go with ensuite facilities only!!! Granted they are the smallest bathrooms (the term watercloset could not be more appropriate) I have ever seen in my life. One must make a decision on which direction you need to face prior to closing the door as you can literally not turn around once inside. I stayed there one summer when the temps were in the 90's and for London that's hot, the heat in the hotel was still going full blast however. Apparently it was either heat or no hot water.... All in all it does not even equal the level of a Motel 66 in the States, still it is cheap and if you are looking to be close to the clubs and nightlife of Soho it's crawling distance.	
Feb 16 2004	It IS that bad	Do not listen to those that say &quot;it isn't so bad&quot; - IT IS!! Me and my boyfriend booked the Lonsdale over the internet (sadly before we had seen this site) for a romantic Valentines weekend. On arrival, we were told that we could not have our booked room (double ensuite) and were instead given a tiny room with three single beds shoved in, and little else. Oh, a TV on a rickety table. Of course the TV didn't actually work. And the toilets were down the hall. The walls and furniture are more than just &quot;mismatched&quot; as someone has generously stated, they were downright dirty. We were not looking for a fancy hotel, but expected to get what we had booked and expected it to at least be clean! It is so far from the description and pictures on the website that it should be reported to Trading Standards. Like so many others, we were made to pay a cancellation fee of one night, but we stayed for neither of the nights we booked. Luckily we found somewhere else to stay (next door!) and didn't let it ruin our weekend. We would never recommend this 'hotel' to anyone, and as for it being a &quot;uniquely European experince&quot;, there is nothing European about a dirty shabby run-down little dump with a funny smell.
