Sep 9 2009 	Ideal central location personal comfortable accommodation	Our first visit to London and this was ideal location - central to any and everything we crammed into 3 days sight seeing. Room (separate bedroom and sitting area) was tasteful, comfortable, airconditioned - home away for home! Staff were always helpful, there when needed, otherwise discretely distant. Whilst most (including ourselves) would normally consider this expensive, it was really tremendous valuey - could walk to anything. If you consider the sitting room sofa was a fold out double bed, it could be very attractive for a family, even 2 couples.Room service was very good, night or day.	
May 30 2009 	solid as a rock	22 Jermyn has always been a favourite. You cannot beat the location a small private hotel in central London. I stayed here ten years ago with my husband en route to Athens. I returned to the same suite to find nothing had changed, not even the decor. (they have upgraded the television sets) While that familiarity is comforting when traveling alone, it could be said that 22 could do with a good spiff up; paint job, new carpets, etc. The best part of 22, however, is the staff. They just cannot do enough to help you. I required a bit of assistance, and they were OUTSTANDING in every way. They will always be my default choice. You might get a fancier lobby or a trendier room, but you won't get better service. Try Veraswamy (Indian) for dinner around the corner, or go to Fortnum and Mason and choose a picnic to enjoy in the room.	
Apr 14 2009 	Never disappoints	2nd stay this year at 22 and just as good as the first. Rooms are so comfortable and well appointed, staff are lovely and the whole experience makes you feel special. Its size makes it feel like coming home in London. Can't rate it highly enough.	
Jan 6 2009 	Fantastic stay at 22 Jermyn Street!	My husband and I stayed at 22 Jermyn street over New Years with our two children, aged 3 and 8. We had a fantastic stay at this &quot;boutique townhouse&quot; hotel -- the service was fabulous and our room was very comfortable and well appointed.We stayed in their Willow Suite, which was essentially an apartment -- a bedroom with king-sized bed, a living room with couch that pulled out into a queen sized bed, a dining room, an enormous bathroom (with separate tub and shower, and 2 sinks), a small kitchen, and a rooftop terrace from which we were able to see fireworks on New Years Eve. It was a HUGE space especially by London standards. There was a TV in the bedroom and a TV and DVD player in the living room. It was extremely comfortable for our family.The hotel does not have a bar or restaurant, but does have 24 hour room service which was top notch. We had a fantastic afternoon tea as well as yummy breakfasts.22 Jermyn went out of their way to make sure our children were comfortable. They have a wide assortment of childrens' DVDs (we enjoyed watching Harry Potter!) and bring popcorn and soft drinks to your room for you to enjoy while you watch your movie. They even babysat our children so that my husband and I could go and enjoy dinner out by ourselves! They also have child-sized bathrobes for children.The furnishings were elegant and comfortable, and the hotel provided wonderful L'Occitane toiletries in the bath and a bowl of fruit and nuts (in our case, it was tangerines and walnuts) for us to snack on.The staff was extremely friendly and always greeted us by name -- they all even remembered the childrens' names!The hotel is very located in the St. James area, and a stone's throw from Piccadilly Circus. Jermyn Street itself has lots of wonderful boutique shops including Fortnum and Mason, Paxton and Whitfield cheeses, and several men's outfitters.This hotel comes with my highest recommendation. I would definitely stay there again and especially recommend it if you are traveling with children!	
Nov 1 2008 	Pleasant but have no plans to return	I booked this hotel mainly out of curiosity, having walked past it several times while in London on business. At the time of booking it had good reviews on Trip Advisor.I stayed for three nights and took one of the suites. The lounge overlooked the alleyway that links Jermyn Street to Piccadilly so it was noisy at night with the window open. The room was comfortably decorated but some of the paintwork was chipped but the furnishings were a good quality and very comfortable. The bedroom was not large but again lovely bed and bedlinen and good wardrobe space. I liked the bathroom, unlike the reviewer below, true there was no walk in shower, just one over the bath but it was well appointed with lovely toilettries, even mouthwash and shaving foam.The staff were very helpful and obliging and the room was clean.There are no tea or coffee making facilites in the room and when you return at night they ask you if you would like an bedtime drink, which they bring up on a silver tray - and charge you for.The rooms are large enought to provide a tray for this and at the prices they charge you shouldn't have to pay for a nightcap hot drink.There are no public areas in the hotel whatsoever, not even a toilet. While I waited for my taxi I had to sit on a small chair in the tiny reception area, I needed to go to the toilet but as I had checked out of my room and someone was already in it had to wait until I got to Euston.When I got home I realised I had left my phone charger in the room and called the hotel and asked them to post it to me.They said they would and it promptly arrived a couple of days later in a Jiffy bag, the postage of such was £1.75.A few days later I received a letter informing me my credit card had been charged £30 for the return of the charger. Furious I called the hotel and asked to be put through to the manager. I told her I objected to the charge and should have been told about it when I requested it was returned, a new charger would have cost less. She was very apologetic and said this was an error and would refund the charge immediately. I then received a letter from her saying the error had occured because gentleman guest had left all their shoes at the hotel and I had been charged for their return. I accept this was an error but when I requested initially the charger be returned the girl I spoke to remembered me ( I had left the staff a generous tip as they had been very helpful) so I was somewhat suprised they confused me with a man who had left their shoes behind. Sadly this has somewhat soured me inclination to return to 22 Jermyn Street.However I would recommend it, if you are happy to stay in a hotel with no public areas, if you are looking for somewhere discrete in London and it would be ideal for a family as children could stay in the lounge. If you like small and bijou then you would enjoy 22 Jermyn Street	
Aug 11 2008 	Can't recommend it	The strongest point in favour of this small hotel is it's central position very close to Piccadilly Circus. I stayed there in a suite for one night with my wife and daughter but was not entirely satisfied.Doubtless, the hotel is in an old building but, for the price, I would have thought that the place would have been properly refurbished. It has not. The whole fabric of the lobby, the lift, corridors and rooms is worn and tired. The bathroom was equally run down.Our suite was of a good size but stifling in the summer heat. The air conditioning unit in our bedroom was noisy and inefficient so we hardly got a wink of sleep. When we opted to turn off the unit and open the window instead, the traffic noise was too loud to bear!I will say that the breakfast in our room was good but the whole package was overpriced and not good value for money.	
Jul 25 2008 	No Amenities for the price	Recently stayed here for two nights in London while on a convention. The suites themselves are spacious but a little tired. They must be refurbished in order to maintain the price and quality they are advertising. There is no reception area to sit at or a bar to have a drink at. It is no hotel by any means, but they do offer 24 hour room service if this is what you are after. The beds are comfortable and the bathroom amenities are good. It is OK, but not what I was after.	
Jun 10 2008 	So-so	We had high hopes for this 'hidden gem' as we love boutique hotels but this one didn't quite live up to our expectations.On the positive side, the location is perfect, the rooms filled with luxuries (orchids, fruit, top class toiletries, bath robe etc etc) and the staff very friendly and knowledgeable.We loved the 'town house feel' of the property and the two or three pages of restaurant recommendations produced by the manager containing his personal dining experiences, walking distances to the restaurants etc.Unfortunately, our standard room was rather small. In fact, we had to move the coffee table before we could fully open the suitcase. The room also looked out over neighboring roof tops and suffered from the noise and odors from nearby restaurant extractor fans.The room had an AC unit under the window but was too noisy to operate all evening and, as neighboring extractor fans made opening the window impossible, it was quite stuffy.The staff offered to move us to a nearby room but as it was only on the first floor and located above an alleyway (which had a high degree of foot traffic late into Saturday night) we decided to stay where we were.Maybe if you opt for a suite on the top floor, you will avoid these problems. It was a cute place in a great location and it is sad we didn't have a better experience.	
Jun 6 2008 	Lies...	On booking I was told a standard room was not available and that as it was a booking in the next 24 hours a suite room would be allocated instead.On arrival I was told there was no suite rooms (even though this had been confirmed through laterooms and myself ringing the hotel). The room I was given was about 30 degrees and in the roof of the hotel.I stay in London a lot and would not recommend this hotel or stay there again.	
Apr 11 2008 	Excellent Spot	This hotel provided so much --- a very convenient location, the feel of a London townhouse, lovely rooms, a very nice continental breakfast and unfailingly helpful staff. While our room wasn't ready when we got there around 1:00 p.m. we were comforted by the news that we had been upgraded to a suite. We probably weren't in the rooms enough to justify such luxury but enjoyed having all that space when we were in them.We were on the top floor of rooms and, even so, heard some street noise so pack earplugs if you are sensitive to that. Chalk it up to being in the heart of a city that is lively much of the night.There are beautiful orchids both in the room and in the stairwell. We had fresh fruit in our room every day which kept our diets a wee bit healthier than they might have been.	
Feb 6 2008 	An excellent find	This hotel is a well kept secret, it is very well hidden on Jermyn St! The decor of the hotel is a little old fashioned in style but that's just a matter of personal taste and it's all in good condition. My room was spotlessly clean with a very comfortable bed, cd player, DVD player (DVDs available from reception), a good selection of L'Occitane toiletries and best of all fresh flowers and fruit. The location of the hotel is perfect too, right behind Picadilly, a few minutes walk from Leicester Square, Soho and the shops. But what really makes the hotel stand out is the service from the staff. All of them were friendly and helpful and seemed to really care about making sure guests enjoyed their stay. I can't recommend this hotel enough.	
Oct 29 2007 	Hidden Treasure	Me and my partner stayed at this small hotel in an excellent location. The bedroom was lovely with a large double bed. We had a small sofa to sit and watch the tv on. We had fresh fruit in the room waiting to be enjoyed.The bathroom was gorgeous and had the best toiletries you would want to use. The bathropes were fluffy as well as the towels. Staying in this hotel room, you wouldn't want to venture out, especially if you were staying for a weekend with your loved one.You wouldn't need to step far outside of the hotel to be by exciting restaurants and shops which are great.Staff at this hotel were polite and friendly too.I would recommend this hotel for romantic couples.It does not have a bar or restaurant, but you could order snacks in your room of the menu which is bought to your room.	
Sep 14 2007 	Perfect London Experience	I lived in London years ago and this was my first time back in 12 years. We were only there for a 4 days so I wanted to have as close as I could get to a &quot;real&quot; London experience. The hotel is perfect. Small enough to be quaint but big enough for all the luxury amenities one desires ! We travelled with our 14 year old son and 14 month old daughter. The hotel is WONDERFUL with children and no request was too small in catering to our baby. The staff are stellar. Perfect Central location - right down to the lovely restaurant (Rowleys) across the street and Mini-Tesco (supermarket) on the corner. Picadilly Tube is 3 mins walk . It is a little noisy outside at times - but when you sleep in a city you have to expect that !	
Jul 27 2007 	Nice (but a bit noisy)	My son and I stayed one night at 22 Jermyn in early July. The location is great during the day -- close to the theatres, right on a good shopping street, and very central for walking to many attractions -- but it's noisy at night and early in the morning, due to street noise typical of a commercial area. Besides that, it was very nice. We had a one-bedroom suite with the bathroom off the hall between the bedroom and the living room, which gave both of us privacy. The decor is homey, not fancy; it felt as though we were staying with an aunt or grandparent. It has a pleasant, low-key feel, nothing pretentious. There is no restaurant or bar -- it's a London townhouse, so you enter the front door, walk down a hall, and there's the tiny reception desk and the tiny elevator.The very best thing about staying at 22 Jermyn, is the extensive printed list of recommended restaurants, galleries, and attractions written by the owner. These up-to-the-minute reviews of the newest and best places to dine with very accurate estimates of price and walking distances were invaluable for our stay in London. I would return.	
May 7 2007 	Great Location Superb Service Luxurious Large Rooms	I stayed in this hotel for five nights with my family and found everything about it thoroughly superb.For tourists, the location is fantastic, located on a side street just off Piccadilly Circus with easy access to the underground, West End theatre, Soho restaurants, regent street shopping and major sitesincluding Trafalgar square, the National Gallery, Fortnum and Mason's, St. James's Park and Westminster. We were particularly fond of walking just 5 minutes over to Leicester Square every morning and picking up half price evening theatre tickets before starting our sightseeing. There are other conveniences too, including a Tesco Express (grocery store) across the street for sundries and forgotten toiletries and a large Waterstone's bookstore close by.The hotel itself is small, with only 16 rooms and the entrance is tucked away amidst the many formal accessories shops that line JermynStreet. I found the entrance thoroughly unique and charming, and onceinside, found the hotel to be decorated in a classic English style, reminiscent of an Edwardian rooming house, with rich colours and traditional motifs. We had booked one of the suites (there are three kinds categorized by size), and were pleasantly surprised to be offered a free upgrade.By London standards, the room was huge and included a fully separate living area, bedroom and bathroom. In keeping with the history of the building, there were soaring 12 foot ceilings with large picture windows overlooking Jermyn street, and the room was richly designed with traditional furniture and soft deep-coloured carpets. Inside theliving room was a round dining table, with plush chairs, a large pull-out bed couch, arm-chair, desk, bar, stereo and TV player with DVD. The bedroom was smaller and came with two twin beds (though there are suites with queens), a wardrobe, desk and another TV. The bathroom, while not the largest or most opulent I've seen, did include a very nice, modern bathtub/shower unit and came with an impressive selection of Molton Brown amenities. Wireless internet wasavailable and only cost GBP8.50 per 24 hours, not bad at all by London hotel standards.While the room was impressive and the location ideal, the service waswhat made 22 Jermyn special, with the small size of the hotel meaninghighly personalised attention. Little touches such as fresh fruit delivered to the room on a daily basis, complimentary olives when we ordered ice and always asking if we would like tea or coffee when we returned from our outings helped to make our stay here feel extra welcome. Even though the hotel is small, it offered the full servicesthat one would expect from a larger hotel. Room service is 24 hours, you can access a nearby health facility and the doormen will hail a cab from the street and bring it to the door within 5 minutes. Other requests went by seamlessly as well, with the hotel's restaurant recommendations and sightseeing referrals always spot on. Indicativeof the knowhow of management, the hotel owner publishes a monthly newsletter detailing all the shows and restaurant developments in town. The value of the hotel is also superb, with the price of the suite roughly the same as a standard room in a larger London 5 star property.The only negative point I found was the noise from Jermyn Street at night. While most of the bedrooms (I think) do not overlook the street, I was sleeping on the pull-out couch bed in the living room which did, and I was kept up by the noise from late night partyers as well as delivery trucks running up and down the street all night. Overall though, I would say that there is very little to fault in this hotel and I was nothing but impressed with the quality and size of the room, the unique charm of its traditional character and the conscientious and professional service.	
Jan 1 2007	Lovely; Great Location	We stayed in a two room suite with our teenagers and highly recommend 22 Jermyn St. It was well appointed with a beautifully decorated main room, which included a fireplace. Our children slept in this &quot;living room&quot;, one on the couch, which pulls out and the other on a rollaway provided by the hotel. The room was big enough to accodomate both kids easily. It was also great to have this sitting room available during the day. We could eat breakfast at the 4 person table and have plenty of space to take a break from sightseeing. We could all spread out and read or our kids enjoyed watching a bit of British TV--especially at night. This nicely decorated, clean, well appointed room gave us the sense of being in England vs. some anonymous hotel room.In the configuration we had, the bathroom is off the bedroom. While we didn't mind this, be aware that anyone staying in the &quot;livingroom&quot; has to pass through the bedroom to get to the only bathroom.We just loved this hotel--which is actually a townhouse. There is no lobby or public space downstairs. You come in off the street, pass through a narrow hallway and the &quot;front desk&quot; and then go up to your room. If you are looking for a restaurant, bar or other public space, this would not be the place for you. If you are looking for a well appointed, clean, great location--definately stay here. Also, because we were travelling with kids, it wound up being a lot cheaper to stay here than getting two hotel rooms--and also a lot nicer. I highly recommend this lovely, top shelf property.	
Dec 24 2006 	A Wonderful Small Hotel Experience	This was the finest small hotel experience I have ever had. From the hotel-arranged driver who picked us up at Gatwick, to the helpful and courteous staff who arranged opera and musical tickets, to the lovely two-room suite, I cannot say enough positive about 22. The location is superb--5 minute walk to the National Gallery, 15-minute walk to the British Museum, 10 minute walk to Covent Garden. We never had to take a cab or the tube to get where we wanted to go. The 24-hour room service (though a little limited) was wonderfully prepared. Our room featured a great mini-bar with single-malt scotches and full bottles of good wine. The hotel provides restaurant recommendations for all types of cuisine, and many good restaurants are located within walking distance. Jermyn Street has wonderful shopping. Overall, I could not have asked for more!	
Jul 25 2006 	(Almost) Better than home!	You could not ask for anything more wonderful than arriving at the charming 22 Jermyn Street. It was (almost) better than coming home. The staff are brilliant, the location absolutely brilliant - walking distance to just about everything, the rooms divinely 'English' in that country house way that only the English can do. No bar or restaurant but the Room Service could put any Asian hotel to shame. Prompt, efficient, beautifully presented and not overpriced. A request for an ice bucket arrived within moments, complete with a dish of olives and slices of lemon on a tray - they obviously figured I needed my martini or gin &amp; tonic after a day running around the city!!. And the coffee.... hot, strong and plenty of it! Flowers everywhere in the suite. This hotel made me fall in love with London all over again..... in fact, I really didn't want to leave.	
Nov 27 2005 	Like staying with Friends!	Stayed here for one night in late nov 2005. My normal hotel (the Dorchester) was booked out so tried this for a change as I was only staying for one night to do some shopping and meet up with friends. The staff make this hotel - very professional and friendly, remembered my name every time I came into the lobby, were very helpful with recommendations and clearly had a very intimate knowledge of London. As an example, I requested a recomendation for a semi-formal, french restaurant on a Sunday night. Within minutes, there were three staff at the front desk, all discussing various options and providing detailed descriptions. End result, great dinner at La Caprice.Room was normal for London in terms of size (i.e. small) but nicly appointed with a very good bathroom. Suggest this room (104) for singles who want a quiet room (no view, looks into an internal courtyard but no traffic noise).Position is, of course, unbeatable for shopping - just watch out as it easy to over shop if one can quickly return to the hotel to drop off bags!	
Nov 4 2005	Jermyn Gem	My wife and I splurged by ending our UK vacation with 4 nights in a corner suite at this VERY discreet hotel. Everything was A+, from the flowers in the rooms, to the coutesy of the staff, to the quality of the room service. I was a bit disappointed that there was no bar to relax in, but the hotel is located so centrally that it was easy to find a nearby spot (I especially recommend the Red Lion just down the street). The rooms were comfortable and elegant. There was a bit of street noise beginning at 0630 each morning from the street sweeper, rubbish collectors, etc., but nothing too severe. The staff does a marvellous job helping with dinner and theatre reservations, and does it all without a hint of snobbishness. The location is wonderful, and we walked almost everywhere.	
Sep 28 2005	Very Private	22 Jermyn Street is definitely not for the type of person that is looking for a large hotel. It's a tiny little place in an excellent location. The staff is so unbelievably kind and will go out of their way to make sure that you are happy. I recommend the tea service, the food is so fresh. Our room did smell a little smoky but it's Europe, everything smells like smoke. (I'm a retired smoker). Think pied-a-terre with a butler....not a Hilton with room service.	
Jun 8 2005	Little gem just off Piccadilly	Stayed at 22 Jermyn Street for the first time this week, on personal recommendation. It was charming - idiosyncratic but very comfortable. It is really hidden away - even the London cabbie missed it! All that gives its location away is a dark green front door in Jermyn Street, next to Bates' hat shop. Inside, a long corridor leads to a tiny reception desk and the lift - and that's it. No restaurant or bar - just personal room service. We were upgraded to a very pleasant suite (403) - no double glazing, so thankful that we were overlooking a pedestrianised street between Jermyn Street and Piccadilly. Fresh flowers in all three rooms, including red rose in the bathroom. Lovely fluffy towels and dressing gowns, Molton Brown toiletries and a comfortable bed. Will stay there again - and the best location for some of the best shopping in London.	
May 11 2005	Excellance at 22 Jermyn St	We just returned home from London and our stay at 22 Jermyn St. This quaint little hotel with top notch service was excellant. The location can't be beat, it's close to many great restaurants, the theatre district and the tube stop at Piccadilly Circus. The staff will go out of their way to please and provide you with whatever you need - be it a new curling iron for the lady or popcorn for movie watching. We had a bouquet of fresh roses waiting for us when we arrived and another bouquet was delivered on Monday to add a fresh touch to the room.The rooms feel like small apartments. The beds are comfy with lots of pillows. The bathrooms large by comparison to other hotels and supplied with Moulten Brown toiletries. And the sitting room had a comfortable couch, reading chair and dining table.You do hear some noise from the surrounding streets, but there will always be noise in the middle of a big city. And it wasn't so loud that you couldn't get a restful night's sleep.We can't wait to go back to London and we will definitely be staying at 22 Jermyn St once again.	
Apr 18 2005	Great location and family hotel	Our family of four stayed here last summer for a week. Fabulous location, excellent service and immaculate, pretty rooms. Our first room (suite) had the bedroom on the airshaft--the bedroom itself was small, and the bathroom even smaller, a bit awkward also for four of us as the kids had to come through the bedroom to get to the bathroom. After a couple of nights we were moved (at same price) to a corner suite, which had a large bath between the sitting and bedrooms, and the bedroom also was much larger. We would definitely stay here again. Our kids especially enjoyed the popcorn with their videos!	
Jan 26 2005	Worst Hotel I have stayed at in London	This is by far the worst hotel I have had the (dis)pleasure of staying at in over 20 trips to London. I had always wanted to stay here, because of the allure. What a disappointment! The hotel itself is miniscule -- not something I would normally mind, but it doesn't even have that time-honored London tradition of a lobby bar. If it had a lobby. The staff did not know how to use the wireless internet service -- I had to call four times to get the correct password. The location is certainly wonderful, but apparently busy enough that they lock the door at night -- I had to wait 10 minutes for someone to open the door tonight. And the room -- small and drabby. The only person who could love this room is someone who spent their honeymoon here 25 years ago. It has not changed, I assure you. The heat has two settings -- off and 95 degrees. There are simply too many good hotels, even plebeian hotels, in London to bother staying here.	
Jun 24 2004	Luxury location	We stayed at 22 Jermyn St. in November of 2002. The hotel was very elegant and private, with just a small sign designating the entrance. We definitely felt we were in the lap of luxury. However, our suite faced an alley/walkway that ran between Picadilly and Jermyn Street. There was some sort of Turkish pub or restaurant directly below our room, and the patrons had a habit of singing very loudly as they left the pub at 2:00 a.m. Plus, we heard all the noise of Picadilly Circus from our room. The management suggested that we ask for a room facing the airshaft/rooftops next time as it would be quieter. My rating: room--5 stars. Location--4 stars (very convenient to West End, tube, Kensington Gardens, Buckingham Palace, Picadilly, shopping), but very noisy, esp. at night. Service--5 stars (very helpful staff.) No restaurant, but plenty of places close by.	
Jun 13 2004	Loved 22 Jermyn	We loved our weekend at 22 Jermyn Street. We arrived to hear the sweet words &quot;You have been upgraded&quot; to a suite. Beautiful, large rooms, immaculate housekeeping and excellent, helpful service by all the staff at this small, lovely bontique hotel, all served up with a smile. Great central location for theater and most of the main attractions. The room service and &quot;high tea&quot; here are not to be missed. 	
May 16 2004	Nice people but...Uhg	Perhaps it was because we had just stayed at the Milestone, or perhaps because our view was of some airshafts and industrial looking rooftops. It was billed as a 5 star, but we may have been less disappointed if they had called it a 4 star. (Laterooms.com still has the best rates available, but I'm not sure how they get by calling it a 5 star.) The taxi driver couldn't for the life of him find this teeny place, and tho we had been initially ok'd for an early check in, we would have to return in several hours. The room-service cont. breakfast did have the best croissants anywhere (France included), even if over-priced. The staff members were personal with fine service, but the ambiance of the room was a bit bland and the bathroom was awfully cramped. Added bonuses were the towel warmer and toiletries including shaving oil. The overall feel of the place left me not planning a return, however it might be acceptable for a business traveler esp with its central location.	
Mar 25 2004	Worth it! Wonderful!	Staying here is like staying at a beautiful private home. I have stayed in almost every great hotel in London, and now see the others as overpriced and pretentious compared to this gem. My room was fabulous - but they all are. The hotel has no restaurants or public spaces - just guest rooms - but the room service is terrific. I am still thinking about the meal I had there! Wonderful, dreamy bed. Opulent toiletries in the bathroom. Spotlessly clean, elegantly furnished, and capably staffed. Had trouble using my new ATM card in London and was low on cash. As it was Sunday, the front desk offered to &quot;loan&quot; me a couple hundred Pounds in cash until the banks opened the following day. Try getting that kind of service at the Lanesborough! I'll never stay any other place in London.
