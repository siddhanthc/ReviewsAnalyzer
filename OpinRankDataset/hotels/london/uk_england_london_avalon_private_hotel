Aug 18 2008 	Felt like home!	Me, my friend and my mom spent a weekend (15. and 16.8. 2008) in the Avalon hotel and we absolutely loved this place! After having read some of the reviews and because of the bargain price (79 pounds/night for a triple room) we were mentally prepared for some hostel-like disastrous accommodation, but we have found a real gem instead! We arrived at London on early Friday morning and the hotel was just a few minutes walk from the St. Pancras International railway/metro station, situated in a really calm street and there were also lots of small shops and restaurants nearby.The hotel had a cosy hall and a pleasant atmosphere with soft carpets everywhere.All the hotel staff was very nice and friendly. It was absolutely no problem to leave our luggage in the hotel before the check-in and again the whole day after the check-out. Our room was situated on the top floor and there was everything that a tourist might need to stay overnight. The toilets and shower/bathtub were in the corridor on our floor and everything was very neat and clean. Our room was large, with a wash-basin, a plug adaptor, a TV and facilities to make our tea/coffee. The beds were comfortable and we heard no noise from the neighbours. In fact, there must have been other people on our floor (the hotel had no vacancies), but we never saw anyone nor had to wait for the shower or toilet...We had a great time in London, were very satisfied with the Avalon hotel and will definitely come back there again!	
Jul 12 2008 	WORST NIGHTMARE	I have traveled many places and have stayed in all types of accommodations, and the Avalon Hotel was the absolute worst place I have ever stayed in. It was worse than camping in a wet tent and more uncomfortable than sleeping in my car. Upon check-in we were asked to pay immediately. I have learned from this experience to always ask to see a room before paying. We were in a room with two twin beds at the very top floor. To get there, we had to climb a very narrow staircase, where duct-tape was literally holding one of the railings together (a serious safety issue, especially when climbing up the steep stairs with luggage). As we entered our room's hallway, I realized immediately we had made a terrible mistake. The wallpaper was stained and peeling as though the roof has a serious leaking problem. The ladder to the attic was hanging half way down in the middle of the hallway and we had to go around it so we wouldn't hit our heads and for some reason, there was a coffee pot sitting on the floor. When we stepped into our room, we found even worse things waiting for us. On each bed were two badly worn-out towels and a bar of complimentary USED soap. USED!!! Both bars were unwrapped, with grey and cracking edges -- the words imprinted on the soap were also worn down which is what happens to USED soap. The bedspreads were obviously unclean as there were pieces of dirt and other debris on them. The floor of the room was sinking in, and there were even weak places that felt like holes in the floor under the carpet. The carpet was not clean (more debris), and was terribly stained. There were 4 large mosquitoes flying around the room. The room felt damp and looked moldy. There was mold on the walls, especially toward the ceiling. The furniture had not been dusted or cleaned in sometime. The window would not open or close all the way properly (plus one pane had a huge crack/hole in it). For some reason, there was a plate and fork sitting on the dresser -- both of which did not look clean. The drinking glasses were also not clean, and one of them had dried toothpaste SPITTLE on it. The toilets, located across the hall, were just as bad -- doors wouldn't shut all the way, the linoleum was badly bubbled, and the tile was missing off the walls and the walls were moldy. The room with the tub was even worse; very unclean and stained. Apparently there was a shower somewhere on our floor, but we didn't even bother investigating. When we asked for our money back, we were told that it would not be given back immediately, and the management would decide about giving it back later (through the course of the conversation, we were led to believe no money would be given back). We were told that we should not expect much more than what we got because we were paying budget hotel rates (68 pounds, which was approx. $140 American dollars). The man was also not concerned about the used soap or unclean appearance of the room -- said that he can't help what the housekeepers do or don't do. Bottom line, after a lengthy conversation, we realized it was either stay here or sleep on the streets (there were no other hotels in the entire Russell Square/Euston Road area that had any vacancies -- we checked, believe me!). While all of the above is more than enough to send one running and screaming from an establishment, we were truly stuck. As if all of this isn't bad enough, I am pretty sure the sheets of my bed had not been changed after the last guest -- the sheets smelled of cologne which I do not wear. We slept, or tried to sleep, in our clothes so little of our skin would touch the sheets. At daybreak we got up, grabbed our luggage, and got out of there. We left a note for management with our complaints and also asking for at least half of our money back. I doubt very seriously we'll hear anything back from those people. I am embarrassed to say that I even stayed at the Avalon Hotel because it made me feel dirty and itchy. It took me two days to get over the creepy-crawly feeling, and I still feel like itching when I think about it. Long story short, don't stay here. I am wondering if London has a government department that declares certain public places “condemned,” and if so, I’m wondering why this place hasn’t been investigated; the Avalon Hotel is dirty and creepy, but more importantly it is very unsafe what with the taped-up railing and holey/weak floors.	
May 21 2008 	Basic with a capital B	Ok, it's clean.Ok, they are friendly.And the location is not too bad (close to St. Pancras / Euston train sations).Unfortunately this is pretty much everything positive i can say about this place. It is basic - very basic even for London standards. The furniture looks like either someone disposed it or they got it from the salvation army, rooms are tiny, walls are thin (you can hear almost everone else coming and going) and the window did not close properly, i would not want to stay here in winter.Bathrooms and toilets are shared.Fifty pound (what i paid per night) will get you something more decent, with private facilities, even in Central London.Stay elsewhere if you don't depend on the location.	
Jan 1 2008 	Value for Money	Have stayed at this hotel several times over a number of years and found it value for money. The location is good, reasonably clean, and quiet. Plenty of restaurants in the vicinity and convenient to transportation as well as the British Library.It used to have excellent breakfasts but alas no more. The management is friendly and it is possible to haggle over the price of a room especially if you stay a week.	
Oct 3 2007 	Hands down worst hotel I've ever (not) stayed at	I absolutely hated this hotel. When we first came in, there was this weird smell I couldn't get rid of. We had two very large suitcases, and then found out we were on the very top floor. The first one or two staircases were fine, but the third was treacherous. I'm honestly glad I didn't sprain an ankle. Upon entering the room, we saw that there were panes missing from the window, and the room was really chilly. The beds were lumpy and thin, and it felt like I might as well have been sitting on the ground. The t.v. didn't even turn on. And worst of all: the communal bathroom was absolutely disgusting. There was no showerhead, and to hell would I take a bath in one of the dirtiest bathrooms I'd ever seen. That did it for us. We took our bags right down again, checked out, and stayed at another hotel.	
Jul 8 2006	Convenient and good value.	I stayed overnight at the Avalon Hotel with my two children of 7 and 11, also with my friend who has two children of the same age. The hotel was fine and good value, the men who booked us in seemed helpful, there was a strange smell but I think I got used to it. The rooms were comfortable and no complaints there, except my room was next to the floors toilets and the doors kept banging keeping me awake, my children were fine though so it was all part of the tales to tell about our trip. When checking out early we had difficulty in finding anyone so we could settle our bill, but got there in the end. Would stay there again for a cheap and cheerful overnight London stay.Julie, Lewis and Leah, Nr Banbury, Oxfordshire.	
Jun 27 2005	Excellent value!	I originally was a bit put off by the reviews I saw on this site for the Avalon, but booked a room there anyway (for £42/night, their Internet rate -- as my photos show, I lucked out and got a twin for the price of a single, because no singles were available, and I called the hotel directly), and am extremely happy I did so. The location (Cartwright Gardens) is fantastic, and the room was perfectly serviceable -- small but clean. Breakfast was also very good. I think the staff has made a real effort recently to update and upgrade the hotel. As long as you realize you're getting a bargain, and know what small hotels/B&amp;Bs in the UK are like, then I have no hesitation in recommending the Avalon to you.	
Dec 20 2004	Used to love it!	I first stopped at the Avalon when I was just ten years old. It was a very nice comfortable private hotel run by a very nice couple. They cared about their guests and accommodated the traveler whenever possible. I enjoyed the Avalon at least ten times. Through the years (I won't say how many), the hotel has simply stagnated. No changes, no upgrades, no paint, no new wallpaper, no mending, no ... well you get the picture. I no longer stop at the Avalon. They are uncomfortable, shabby (not chic), cold and unaccommodating. Late breakfasts crammed in a tiny cubby in the basement; no holding of cases while the traveler travels (this used to be a major benefit); no one on duty; no heat in the room; window pane missing in the rain and NO ONE ON DUTY. Mr. and Mrs Taylor would turn blue to know that their lovely home is now a hole in the wall -- BY THE WAY -- there are still MANY lovely private hotels on Cartwright Gardens...ones like the Avalon used to be.	
Nov 30 2004	Taken by surprise	The key words about the Avalon are &quot;Spartan&quot;, &quot;aged&quot; and &quot;worn-out&quot;. This is the absolutely basic accomodation and this fact takes travellers not familiar with London by surprise. The room and the bathroom were tiny and in need of some extra dusting, plaster was peeling, one of the faucets was leaking. Linens were well-worn. There were no things like shampoo. The walls were certainly far from being soundproof, which was a problem, since a public bathroom was next door from your room.We were asked to pay immediately upon checking in. There was nobody at the front desk in the morning. On Sundays, breakfast is served at 8:30, so you are out of luck if you are an early bird. The bottom line - this is a students' accommodation for a hefty price ($160/day for a triple room with a bathroom). This discrepancy between the price and amenities may be a general London problem, but the available descriptions of the hotel carefully avoided these details.	
Jul 28 2004	It started with the smell...	We should have left when we walked in the door and the entire first floor smelled strongly of rancid cooking oil, but for some reason we checked in anyway. On the plus side, they did give us a triple for the cost of a double so we had a pretty big room. On the other hand, the room was terribly taken care of, grimy and with plaster coming off. Our window wouldn't close all the way, so we had a lot of noise coming in (not birdsong like the last reviewer as our room looked out on the backcourtyard of another building which seemed full of screaming children much of the time). The shower looked like it would fall apart and had no hot water for one of our three mornings. The toilet had a constant slow leak all over the floor. Our room was situated so the head of our bed was right next to the two hallway bathrooms, so doors slammed next to our heads all night. The staff wasn't rude, but certainly wasn't particularly helpful or caring. The breakfast was decent if you could get past the smell of the kitchen.	
May 28 2004	Basic Friendly and Cheap	I had a single room and shared a bath down the hall. A small, old hotel. Very basic accomodations. BUT, wonderfully central, friendly staff, great breakfast. On a scenic Georgian Crescent in the Univ of London/British Library area, I could open my window in the morning and hear the birds singing in the little park across the way. I don't mind funky if I can have bird song instead of traffic noise.
