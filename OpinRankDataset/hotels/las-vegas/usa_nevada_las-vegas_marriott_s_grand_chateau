Nov 25 2009 	Great place to stay - a little bit of walking needed	This hotel was overall very nice. The rooms were immaculate and quiet. The pool and hot tub (on the roof) are a bit small - but lets face it - who goes to Vegas to spend time in a pool. The staff were great and eager to help, on the few times we needed assistance (additional blankets, etc...). The small market on the 1st floor was well stocked but WAY over-priced - you would be better off to find a local Walmart as we did. They do have a shuttle that goes to the supermarket a couple of days a week if you don't have a rental car. The beds were wonderful and perhaps more comfortable than what I have at home.The only problems I had were with the location and our room overlooking the airport. They are located off a side-street next to Plant Hollywood. You have a good solid block to get to the strip. Not a big deal for us, but when you are used to walking out your door and being in the center of it all - it is something to be aware of. The other issue was we didn't check in until mid-week and the only rooms available were in the back facing the airport. The only time it was an issues was the stream of 6:30 am take-offs and landings. Overall, I would recommend this place to anyone looking to have nice lodging in Vegas.A few other tips: avoid valet if you are going back out that same day - park in the back of the hotel (we did do valet at night); the view from the roof at night is nice on a warm night; avoid the lobby market; the showers use full shower-heads - not those whimpy water-conserving ones :)	
Nov 8 2009 	first time in vegas	this was an awesome resort with a great location. not much to do at the resort but the pool has an amazing view and the place is beautiful. i would definately recommend this resort to any family or people who want to go to vegas and still be able to enjoy your time there and still have a relaxing time.	
Nov 4 2009 	Position "A" on the Strip but forget about sleeping in.	Great place and a good position next to the strip. The only problem we incountered is that in the morning starting at 7am the valet staff and the people parking their car there have to blow their horn as the move through the parking garage. This continues until 2pm making it impossible to sleep. I'm not sure why they need to keep blowing the car horns all morning long but they need to find a different way.	
Oct 30 2009 	Home away from home in Vegas	Being non gambler, this resort has made Vegas fun. The service is great and the facility is like having a the fashionable apartment on the strip. We had a one bedroom and cooked most of the time. There is a shuttle bus part of the week that goes to a supermarket(they have a basic shoppette off the lobby). The conceigere was great in booking trips to zion and bryce canyon in Utah, helping us rent a car to visit the Valley of Fire, tickets to Bette Midler and info on the deuce bus that goes up and down the strip for a set fee. There is always cold flavored with fruit or vegetable water in the lobby which was great for walkers like us. The construction wasn't a burden, in fact it was great because it kept the traffic down to a minimum. We walked thru the Planet Hollywood which had great shops, shows and restaurants. They even had a Nielsen survey place that paid you with passes or check to view TV shows!We walked to the Mandalay Bay and in the opposite direction to the Encore.It is nice to go to your room and not have to walk thru or passed a casino.It was quiet and we loved the dual shower heads.Flat screen mounted TV and free HBO and Wi Fi a big pluscan't wait to go back.	
Oct 24 2009 	Here is how to get around construction	Yes, the construction is a pain. The first connecting street behind(east) the resort is Audrie. This street connects with Tropicana by going through the MGM property. There are lots of speed bumps and make sure you don't get in the right taxi lane. It comes out on Tropicana and you can go either east or west(towards the strip) depending on which side of the exit you are in. If you choose to go the next street east of Audrie which is Koval, be aware that they are tearing up the intersection and Koval between Harmon and Tropicana is down to one lane both ways. Unless you are in the very slow time of the day I would NOT risk it-take Audrie. In any case, allow for more travel time and yes it is an inconvenience but I do not consider it a major reason to not stay at the Marriott.The resort itself is very nice-as someone else said it is not pretentious. I would not consider it to be 5 Star either in ambience or accomodations. Certainly upscale, comfortable, clean, convenient and blissfully quiet. Great views of the strip. I can't imagine someone would be dissatisfied unless they are looking for a) Excitement b) A great pool scene or c) Over the top luxury. The pool as others have stated is small but there was no fight over lounges as I have had in other locations. Expect to see children in what essentially is a kids wading pool. This is a place where families will spend a week with children in tow.Depending on the price, I would certainly stay there again.	
Oct 16 2009 	Great Place To Stay	We spent a week here in a 1 bedroom suite. It is a great location next door to the Planet Hollywood Casino. The staff went out of their way to help and the rooms were modern with all the amenities. The best thing is being close to the action but not having to put up with all the casino traffic in your hote.	
Oct 14 2009 	Nice rooms friendly staff good location except for the huge construction project!	This is also a timeshare and our friends are owners in the network. The rooftop pool area is small and fills up quickly but is clean and nice. There is a nice little bar there too. Drink prices were a bit high. ($5 for a can of beer, $9 for a daquiri) The rooms are clean and nicely appointed. Ours was a one bedroom with a pull out sofa, one bathroom but a great two person shower. The sleeper sofa wasn't the most comfortable thing in the world but I knew that I would be sleeping on one before I got there. The bed in the bedroom was great just like all marriott properties. We took the &quot;Tour&quot; which is a sales pitch and tour of the timeshares. We didn't buy but we received 4 passes for a helicopter ride up and down the strip which were &quot;valued&quot; at $110/ea. The whole ride was 9 minutes long and it was great but had I paid for it I would have been peeved. The room had a nice kitchen with full size oven and fridge, blender, toaster, coffee maker, etc. very comfortable. It was an easy walk to the Bellagio, Planet Hollywood, and many others, we always felt safe walking around. There is no restaurant or casino in the hotel which was actually kinda nice. They also had complimentary valet parking.	
Oct 13 2009 	Road construction !!!	We checked in on Friday., Oct. 2, 2009. The Studio room is not nearly large enough for 3 people. Just trying to get to this place was a nightmare because of the road construction on both Harmon and Las Vegas Blvd. We missed the turn twice and had to go around the block - took forever. Incidentally, they talk about free Valet parking but Valet is the ONLY method of parking. No self-parking permitted. We turned in our rental car on Sat. evening at 7:00pm and when we picked it up on Sunday morning at 10:00am, the passenger side was covered with blood spatter. Not at all sure what this car was involved in overnight. If you give the Valets your car, be sure to write down the mileage and check it again when you pick it up.	
Oct 12 2009 	a luxury hotel with a sense of being at home	my boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel and had the best time. Service is excellent. The room was a 1 bedroom suite complete with a living room, kitchen, entry hall, master bath/bedroom and a big oval tub right next to our bed! the shower was amazing(it can fit 5 people and it has two shower heads). The flat screen tvs and stereo system/dvd player were great! I loved the stocked kitchen with washer and dryer, plates, wine glasses...every luxury you could think of. Plus elegant and a great location. The roof top pool is too small but has a great view of the strip. Plus guests can use the Planet Hollywood Pool next door which is incredible...And don't forget its non-smoking which is soooo nice! Great security and easy access from the strip. Refined but not pretentious, Marriot is a delight and we didn't want to leave. We don't have children but there's a great kid's room with toys and games. Anything we needed was available at the drop of a phone call. I give this hotel 5 stars. Just 1 tip,,, build a better pool and make more use of the rooftop view! I wish I was there right now! It's the best kept secret in Las Vegas!	
Oct 11 2009	A wonderful week in Las Vegas	Just spent a week in LV and found it a great place to visit. Stayed at the Marriott Grand Chateau, a timeshare with great location just a block off the strip. Staff there were the most pleasant and helpful we have found at timeshares around the US. Saw four shows in six nights with the best being O by Cirque and Terry Fator. Any of the Cirque shows in town would be great and Fator was beyond our expectations. Best restaurants at reasonable prices are Mon Ami Gabi on the strip, French in Paris; and Red Velvet off the strip in Summerlin. Desert viewings included Red Rock Canyon then a trip to the Hoover Dam, both worth doing.	
Oct 11 2009 	Peace and Quiet right off the strip	The Hilton was fantastic. The hotel is literally right off the strip... only a 3 minute walk from the lobby and you're already in the shops at Planet Hollywood! But since there's no casino and it's not actually on the strip, it's fairly quiet and you can get some peaceful rest.Right now, there's construction going on Harmon which makes it hard to get to in and out, but they're promising it'll be finished soon, which will make access really nice because Harmon will be a fairly major street.The Hilton has a really nice kids zone although we didn't use it, it seemed like it was fairly packed with different activities and games. Also, they have a little 24 hour market where you can buy food snacks and other convenient items. 24 hours means you don't have to go anywhere if you need something!! There's a pool and jacuzzi on the room, fairly tame by Vegas standards and the wall around the roof prevents you from seeing everything (and prevents drunk people from falling off...) but I heard the pool bar has very reasonable prices for drinks, although I can't say how good they were. The rooms were fantastic! We had a 2 bedroom 2 bath suite... full kitchen and washer dryer in room. The master bedroom had a jacuzzi tub and a huge shower with two shower heads. The second bathroom had it's own refrigerator, sitting area, and standard bathroom. When we ran out of towels, we called the front desk, someone brought them up, and they even called 15 minutes later to make sure the towels made it and see if we needed anything else. Excellent service. They didn't lobby very hard to get us into timeshare presentations, which was very much appreciated.I don't know how much it costs, but it seems pretty expensive... we used a timeshare exchange to get it so it was well worth it. All in all, a wonderful stay!	
Oct 8 2009 	Great place but construction makes it a challenge to get to	My wife and I spent a few days without our 2yr old daughter and made accommodation at the Marriott Grand Chateau. Very nice place walking distance from Planet Hollywood, Miracle Mile shops etc. We really liked that the hotel is a non-smoking facility except for the rooftop pool area. Staff attentive and rooms are clean and spacious. We would definitely stay here again! Only con, is construction. Noise wasn't too bad, but would recommend not having a car and just take taxi's and shuttles.	
Oct 8 2009 	Outstanding	The hotel was very nice...I really enjoyed my stay it was the best time I had in Vegas,,,the staff was nice, the hotel was great and clean	
Oct 8 2009 	Excellent.... Stay here!	I went for a trip to Vegas in April. We stayed at the Marriott's Grand Chateau. From the moment we stepped out of our vehicle we were met by smiling friendly faces, and excellent service. Our suite was beautiful, well laid out and very clean. Impressed by everything! I have to give cudo's to the staff, they were excellent and very friendly. With tips about Vegas, bringing our purchases up to our room for us. Swimming pool, hot tub and bar on the roof... Amazing. Everything was top notch! Great stay. Loved it!	
Oct 8 2009 	Great Resorty Hotel	I stayed in a 2 bedroom with my husband and my parents for a 4 day weekend, the rooms were separated by the kitchen and living room. Very spacious, there was even a smaller kitchenette in our bedroom. The TV resolution could have been better but I think that's my only complaint. The beds and linens were amazing! and it's very close to PH and it will be just a few steps to the new city center. They have a swimming pool and jacuzzi up top, not too big but enough for a quick plunge! with a bar that makes awesome daiquiries with an awesome view of Las Vegas Strip.	
Oct 4 2009 	Hotel and location were excellent	Absolutely loved staying at the Marriott Grand Chateau on our first visit to Vegas. The room was great. Good size, small kitchen area, very comfortable, and decent view. It was easy to zip into the hotel and get to our room quickly. Nice and quiet on the 25th floor, despite all the construction to widen the strip. The roof top pool and hot tub were nice. The pool was small, but did the trick to cool us off. And you can't beat the view up there. The concierge was very helpful planning some excursions for us and answering questions. The location of the hotel was fantastic; it was in the middle of everything so we could walk to most places we wanted to go. Would stay at the Marriott Grand Chateau again in a heartbeat. Strongly recommended.	
Sep 30 2009 	Fabulous location super spacious fantastic accommodation	As 2 kiwis first time in Vegas and no car, we booked a two bedroom apartment and could not have picked a better place to stay. 40&quot; LCD TV in the living area and a TV in each bedroom, a bathroom each. The larger bedroom also had a bath and a full vanity and make up mirror in the bedroom, in addition to a full size bathroom.You could walk everywhere - and when it was too hot a cab fare to the end of the strip was around $9. The location is excellent - pretty much in the middle of the strip, set half a block back, opposite planet hollywood and the miracle mile shops (around 170 shops that are a mix of cafes, restaurants, amenities, clothes, accessories etc). If you are feeling lazy you only have to walk across the road and you are at the cafes - and they were good value and good quality. Walgreens is a ten minute walk away, you are surrounded by casinos either side of you. If you want to make use of apartment facilities (large fridge, oven, microwave, coffeemaker) you can easily do so. Fabulous spacious rooms, very clean, lovely beds, very very quiet, good little mini-mart onsite. Pick up for grand canyon tour that we took was across the road at planet hollywood (great tour, fly to grand canyon, helicopter through the canyon and land on the floor of the canyon, then boat trip for 20 mins up the colorado river, different route back by helicopter). Service at the Marriott was excellent, concierge very helpful and made reservations for us at Joe's Seafood Restaurant (part of Caesars Palace, located in the Forum Shops) on the night we went to the Bette Midler show - both were fantastic. We aren't gamblers but we totally loved Vegas. it is very impressive - from fantastic theatre, singers, bands, entertainment available - and there is a lot of choice, to high quality cafes and restaurants, to superb shopping (best of France, Italy, European and US shops) this is a great place to stay. Would definitely go back and stay at the Marriott again - fantastic value for money and top notch apartments.	
Sep 24 2009 	Location Location Location and Really Nice Too!	Far enough off the strip to be quiet, close enough to the best part of the strip to be super convenient, this is a great place to stay in Vegas! The unit we had was a little small, and the &quot;neighbors&quot; we had the first night were loud, but when they left, everything was super. We especially liked the pleasant and helpful staff and the delightful roof-top bar. We'd do this one again!	
Sep 24 2009 	Great location quiet and everything's within walking distance.	My wife and I stayed here at the beginning of July. It was our first time in Vegas and my head was still spinning from all the slot machines, colorful ads and loud music (at the Airport!), this hotel was a nice break from all that. From the moment you walk into the front door the hotel looks good; this was definitely one of the higher class hotels I've stayed in. We had a nice, quiet room which was essential given the level of activity outside the hotel. One nice touch was the containers filled with ice water, we probably drank half a gallon every time we came back to the hotel at the end of the day. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful, the ones trying to sell the timeshare weren't pushy and only had to be asked to stop the sales pitch once. Given my experience at this hotel I almost would consider buying a timeshare to stay there more often if my budget allowed. We never had a car so we got everywhere on foot.The furthest we traveled was a half hour walk to/from the Fashion Mall. One tip that will speed up coming off the strip is to cut through the Miracle Mile. As a bonus, you also get a few minutes of AC. They also have a shuttle that runs to/from the Fashion Mall (loved the driver, great guy) and to/from a local grocery store so you can stock up on supplies.My only gripes with this hotel (and they're minor) were that you couldn't cash more than $100 in travelers cheques and the fact that there wasn't a restaurant in the hotel. They have a small store on the main floor but I got pretty sick on the trip and didn't really feel like engaging in microwave cookery with a fever of 103°F.The summary: If and when I go back to Vegas I'm going to stay here again.	
Sep 18 2009 	Good place near the Strip	A good option in LV if you want to have a central location near the strip and not being in a Casino.Rooms are very big and fully fitted (like an apartment), although upon check in there was not coffee maker or coffee cups that we need to ask housekeeping to send. Then the first coffee maker was faulty and also we have to change 2 times the hair drier in the bathroom, so it seems that the people in charge of equipment in the property were not doing their job very efficiently.Besides that the room was very good and comfortable. Service was fast and efficient besides the problems mentioned earlier. The shop downstairs, although convenient, extremely expensive, so we ended buying thing in the ABC Store at the Hollywood Planet across the street.Another problem was the road construction outside the hotel, but no so serious, except taxis needed to make a bit of round coming from the airport.We used their afternoon shuttle to go to Fashion Mall as it was very convenient. Distance to Paris LV was 15-20 minutes on foot and a bit more to Bellagio, so you may not need a car or take a taxi if you want to move nearby the hotel.	
Sep 17 2009 	Definately 5*	Excellent choice of accomodation, we stayed in a 2 bedroom apartment. It was huge with everything you could want. Hotel staff very friendly. View from pool at night very good. Pool quite small although never saw that many people in it. It has water misters that spray out constantly onto the sunbed area which is nice. Valet parking was very efficient but at times would have liked self parking as when coming back with shopping felt pressured empying the car out of the front of the hotel. Valet staff very polite.Hotel just off of the strip which was handy, alot of building work going on across the road from the hotel so you have to walk across a dusty area to get to strip, not that big a deal but not nice when hotel is so nice.	
Sep 17 2009 	Lovely hotel but.....	We stayed in the Marriott's Grand Chateau in January and we had a lovely time in this smashing little gem, the only real problem i had was with the pull out sofa!! We travelled as a group of four and used the Hotel as part of my Sister-in-laws timeshare vacation allowance, however upon arrival they put us in a one bedroom apartment (or villa as they called it). We tried to get a bigger apartment but were not allowed due to the conditions of her timeshare agreement, so this obviously meant that my husband and i would have to sleep on the pull out sofa that was situated in the lounge/kitchen area of the apartment. This sofa bed was the most uncomfortable thing i have ever slept on in my life!! i even had to go to the linen room and &quot;borrow&quot; two duvets to pad out the mattress because it was so awfull and we had to sleep on it for a week.!!. So beware if you a sharing and if you have existing back problems... you will need to over indulge on alcoholic beverages to ensure a good nights sleep (would recommend frozen margarita's from the Casino Royale yum yum!!).Other than that the Grand Chateau was lovely.. set back off the strip behind the Harley Davison Cafe and across the road from Planet Hollywood hotel. It has great views of the strip and the desert, it has a small roof pool and a bar (although it wasnt open when we were there) a small shop (expensive though) and very well equiped apartments with excellant kitchen facilities and a fantastic two person shower and a huge bath!! we always stuck to walking on the main road to the strip for safety (there is a dark alley way off the strip to the hotel) and usually cut throught the shopping mall at Planet Hollywood to get to the strip. Vegas itself is amazing!! wow, wow, wow, Disneyland for grown ups!! I you are looking for accomadation in vegas and you want to be where all the action is then this may not be the place for you..... and try The Bellagio, Caesars Palace, The Mirage, The Palazzo and Venitian etc, but if you dont mind staying in a quiet hotel/timeshare apartment with no rowdy collage kids - in a quiet area off the strip and you enjoy walking - then the Marriott Grand Chateau is perfect for you.	
Sep 15 2009 	Great location excellent service quiet oasis among the hustle 	This is an excellent timeshare hotel. You can get a three bedroom unit with kitchen and living room, a two bedroom with same, a one bedroom with same, or a typical hotel room layout. Great location across the street from Planet Hollywood and just off the strip!	
Sep 14 2009 	Nice hotel central to strip close to everything	We stayed here on the Saturday night before our Sunday-Sunday time share down the street at Tahiti Village. Beautiful hotel, really close to all the casinos and big-name hotels. The rooftop bar has beautiful views, but it closes too early (11pm). Also, the pool is very small. Like the reviewer said below, there is major road construction around this hotel, and the construction made getting there difficult. Stayed in a 2 bedroom unit: very nice appointments, although the dining room table was huge and took up 1/3 of the main room! Definitely would recommend this hotel to anyone.	
Sep 12 2009 	Nice hotel good location some issues	This hotel is like most Marriotts. Its clean, nicely appointed, with nice rooms and wonderful bedding. But this is a vacation club resort, and there is no restaurant, no casino, and no swimming pool. I can live without the casino, because even though we like to play it really is close to the strip. But no restaurant/no room service - is not for me. Yes you can walk over to Planet Hollywood but who wants to have to? And they have no plans for a restaurant. They are getting a pool when they build the next towers but that could be as far away as 2011. We did become members of the vacation club because its an awesome deal, but we probably wouldn't stay at this spot. It does have a fridge and other conveniences - and would be great for families. Except for the lack of pool. Also, road construction is really annoying, means taxis can't get there easily etc. So I will say I would recommend this location, but only for certain people and under certain circumstances. Nice friendly staff and all that - but just these small issues to deal withl	
Aug 26 2009 	Road construction severely restricts hotel access	I give the hotel five stars, but beware of road construction that impedes hotel access horribly. We stayed Aug 23-25. Cab fares were about $2 higher because of detours, and walking was extremely dangerous because sidewalks and crosswalks have been removed. The two handicapped people in our party had a very difficult time crossing the street. The city of Las Vegas could have done better for their visitors on this project.Marriott, however, did an outstanding job! All staff were top notch and the room was to die for. Free wi-fi was also much appreciated, and this hotel is the only one I know of on the strip that offers it free.	
Aug 22 2009 	Great place for family.	Service at this place is great! We travelled with three young kids, and being casino-free and smoke-free, this is a great place for families.	
Aug 16 2009 	Perfect with children	This is the best place to stay with young children since it's smoke-free and casino-free. This is an absolute RARITY in Vegas. It was our most relaxing Vegas trip yet. We were able to walk the strip and enjoy Vegas events (Cirque du Soleil, Excalibur show) without the &quot;Vegas&quot; feel. We even took a hiking trip in the Red Rock Canyon with a great personal tour guide.	
Jul 19 2009 	great location/excellent hotel	Staff/check-in was fast. Every time I had a question throughout the trip, they were quick to assist. got a 2bdrm villa. great room. excellent view, partial of the strip. this hotel is in a perfect location right in middle of the strip. next door to planet hollywood which has an ABC mini grocery store so you can pick up drinks, snacks and liquor. many fashion stores for shopping and great restuarants. good thing about this hotel is that its not loud since no casino..but u're in vegas so u just walk out and u can gamble. recommend printing list off of free shuttles in vegas. avoid taxis. take the DEUCE bus. $3 one way. $7 24 hour pass. you can take the DEUCE to downtown vegas to enjoy fremont st. fav part of the trip. they run 24/7....back to hotel, it was clean. no room service or house keeping but didn't mind. came with everything you would need except for seasoning, salt n pepper so bring some if you plan on cooking because at the 24hr store they have downstairs its expensive. rooftop pool is relaxing and since its rooftop you get a nice breeze. smaller pool but never was crowded. they have towels for your use. hotel is about 15 min rock to hard rock cafe. ask them for list of free transportation. they have free shuttle back to mgm where you can get dropped off and walk 3 min back to hotel. the hotel is right by a gay/lesbian bar fyi....if ur going to club, def recommend not buying any passes/wristbands from any guy or girl in a hotel and especially off the streets. we dont ever fall for that bs but got scammed by a &quot;vip host&quot; at the LUXOR who sounded so legit and claimed she worked for the hotel and claimed what she was giving us were open bar wristbands..which we learned quick was a scam so each lost $20 but hey, that $20 woulda been waisted in a slot anyways...but just another TIP that scammers cld be leauking even in the niccer hotels. the weather is over 100 degrees but even in july, thats not bad with the breeze. from minnesota so use to humid weather so this was not bad. weather at nights are awesome. dont use any taxis from valet service outside this hotel. taxi driver tried tellin us he was gonna take us to an after party later but it was a strip club so made him give us ride back to hotel after he said it wld be free but still tried charging....we told him we didnt have no more $$ and he eventrully walked away. just DNT GET SCAMMED IN VEGAS. oo and if u plan on clubbing, know drinks are more than $10 but the Hawaiian Tropic ZONE right next door at PH will give out occasional free open bar wristbands for ladies only i think which we did go to and it was nice:) overalll...hotel is great location. free shuttle to fashion mall by TI. easy walk to other casinos.	
Jul 13 2009 	Beautiful Hotel in Las Vegas	We went to Las Vegas over the 4th of July and stayed in a 2 bedroom Vill at the Grand Chateau. The hotel is just off the Las Vegas Strip and is just across the street from the Magical Mile shops at Planet Hollywood. The hotel does not have a any casino or gaming, which makes it a quiet, family friendly place. The rooms were clean and had all the amenities. The Villas had a full kitchen as well as a washer/dryer. We just bought food and cooked for breakfast and lunch, and then went out to dinner every evening. The pool is very small, but you have access to the pools at Planet Hollywood and the Polo Towers, so it was not too big of a deal. Also, the rooms did not have balconies. Other than those two minor issues, the place was very nice. Valet parking is complimentary and the valets are very fast and sincere. The rest of the staff is very attentative and helpful. Also, the pullout couches are not really too comfortable, so if you are going with a group of family members like I did, try to get the bed instead of getting stuck with the pullout. But overall, the 2bd Villa is huge. We knew some other people who stayed in a 1bd Villa, and that was very roomy as well.	
Jul 12 2009 	Now this is the way to stay on vacation!!!	We had never been to Vegas, so it was time to go. We did an exchange and booked a flight.The resort is about 250 feet off of the strip and across from Planet Hollywood. A real nice central location. The resort was very nice - check -in was a breeze, everyone was very nice and the room was WOW! The room was a very large one bedroom on the 26th floor and what a view of the area. The room was approx. 800 sq, ft. with a nice kitchen, livingroom, 1 1/2 private bathrooms and big bedroom with a large whirlpoolThey had a free shuttle that in the am would take you to a grocery store and in the pm to the shopping mall. We found the &quot;duce&quot; to be the best transportation - public transportation $7 all day up and down the strip.There is a pool on the top of the building that was nice, but a bit small and crowded. There was also a nice bar by the pool so what the heck, drink and be mary.Do not take the day trip to the Grand Canyon - Not enough time at the canyon - too much time riding. Do go to see Hoover Dam.	
Jul 11 2009 	COULDN'T BE HAPPIER!! Great place to stay!	We are Marriott owners at this resort, but this is the first time we have actually stayed there. If you are exchanging a timeshare to stay here or paying for it, it is easily one of the best places we have ever stayed in. We own a two bedroom unit but only used the one bedroom villa part of it and even that was more than enough room for us. The decor was gorgeous, clean, elegant and top end all the way through. The full kitchen, dining room and UNBELIEVABLE view were all part of what made this awesome. The two person shower, great king sized bed and oversized soaking tub were truly elegant as well!The people who work there look after your every detail and I actually found it was great to have valet parking to make the trip even better. It's right across the street from Planet Hollywood and the Miracle Mile shopping and also has a great view of the new City Center project and within walking distance of the Paris and Bellagio.I can't recommend this place higher.....made for a perfect 10th anniversary t rip. Great job Marriott!	
Jul 9 2009 	Best views in Las Vegas for a terrific family hotel!	I'm just posting a quick review for this hotel while I'm still sitting here enjoying my view of the Luxor, MGM Grand and the Monte Carlo. We came to Las Vegas for a week stay as a quick family vacation. We usually spend a week or two in a beach location in Mexico, but are taking two other major trips this year, so this summer trip is short and close to home (Los Angeles). We knew Las Vegas had enough to offer our kids, but this resort was a surprise.The rooftop pool is perfect. Not too big but plenty of views, chairs and towels. Not to mention the nice rooftop bar. You can see both ends of The Strip from this vantage point. The rooms are well equipped. Full kitchen means full kitchen! Nice bathrooms and great beds. Even though we only got a one bedroom for the five of us, it was big enough. We spent more time than expected here, and it actually worked for us. It's so nice not to have a casino in the hotel, yet everything so close. We are literally half a block off The Strip.The only drawback is not having a restaurant in- ouse. However, right across the street is the Miracle Mile with plenty of reasonable options and then everything from expensive fare to McDonald's and Fatburger less than a block away. It probably made for a more reasonable vacation for us, since we just ended up buying pasta, cereal and eggs at the Walgreens (block and a half) and at the store downstairs (expensive as expected, but well-stocked). Also, the hotel offers a free shuttle to the local Vons at a few different times during the mornings.They also have a kids club that offers quite a range of activities for ALL young ages. I believe they started at 2 yrs old. Finally, the staff is wonderful. From the valet to the bellman to the store cashier, we felt very appreciated. Oh, and free Internet acceess!!!	
Jul 3 2009 	Wonderful stay	This is the first review I've ever written and felt obliged to do so to comment upon the fabulous stay a friend and I had at the Grand Chateau. The no-smoking policy was a welcome relief from the stale smoke filled rooms at the large hotels on the strip. The staff was helpful, pleasant and welcoming. Our room, a one bedroom &quot;villa,&quot; was clean and beautifully decorated, as was the lobby and other common areas. I love Marriott quality and will continue to stay at Marriott properties whenevr feasible for both business and pleasure trips.	
Jul 2 2009 	Spotlessly Clean. Outstanding Service!	We stayed at the Grand Chateau for two nights in a two bedroom unit. We were on the 19th floor and had three seperate views from our room. The children's room (with two queen beds) faced the MGM Grand, the living room faced the MGM Grand, NYNY and Luxor and the master bath faced the new city center and Planet Hollywood.Since we traveled with two children (ages 11 and 14) I will try to recount what made this hotel outstanding for a family stay. First of all it is spotlessly clean. I am an admitted germ freak and very particular about the cleanliess of a hotel room. When we walked in our unit it blew me away. It was so pristine and clean you would have thought we were the first to ever use the room. The kitchen was well stocked and had a front loading washer/dryer, full size fridge, microwave stove/oven and dishwasher. The children's room had two queen beds, a flat screen TV and sitting area. The living room had a comfortable couch, two chairs and a flat screen. The master had a very comfortable king size bed, flat screen and chair. The closets throughout the unit were very large. The master bath was beautiful with double vanity sinks, soaking tub and a huge shower. The best thing is the triple bedsheeting. NO disgusting bedspreads to deal with, so you know it's clean.It was nice to walk about 2 minutes off the strip to such a serene and smoke free building. You must valet park your car. They do not allow you to self park in the garage. However, the valet parking is free and the service to retreive the car was very quick.We did walk to the other hotels. I can say they are nice to see....but I'm not sure about staying there. They are so crowded. Just like the old saying..nice to vist but I wouldn't want to stay there.I just can't say enough about this hotel. The hotel staff treated us so well. This should be the standard that all other hotels strive to meet. Thanks Marriott Grand Chateau for a great stay!!!	
Jun 28 2009 	A true 5 Star Resort WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	I stayed here for 7 days and what a great place this is. It is a 4 minute walk to the strip, it is right beside Planet Hollywood and you can walk to the side entrance of Plant Hollywood in 2 minutes. They have valet parking that is very fast. There is not a casino here and that is nice as it is peacefull and quiet. They have free ice water in the lobby. In the gift shop you can buy a mug for $15 that gives you unlimited refills of soft drinks. That was nice to have. We made out on that deal as there is no telling how many times we filled it up. We were on the 32 floor in a 2 bedroom unit and what a unit it was. It had 2 bathrooms, a kitchen, a dining room, a den and 2 big bedrooms. It was super clean and the view was a 5 star view. You would not belive how nice this room was, it was the nicest we have ever stayed in. On the top of the building is a pool and a jacuzzi and what a view. You could see for miles. Las Vegas was swamped, there were people everywhere and the traffic was a nightmare. I would rather drive in New York City. We had a rental car and we drove out of town alot, Lake Mead is neat, and Red Rock is nice. But dont drive on the strip, it would take forever to get from one place to another. Ethel M Chocolate factory tour is boring, and then they try to sell you high dollar chocolate, at the airport there is a place you can park and watch planes land, that was fun and you would be surprised how neat it is to watch that. I could have stayed there for hours. If you like crowds and lots of traffic you will love Las Vegas. Go see Carrot Top at Luxor and Ka at MGM both good shows. We saw Price is Right Live Game Show, it was just okay, I would not go again. Did I mention how bad the traffic was in Las Vegas. Dont eat at Terribles Casino, it really is Terrible. There is a $7.77 gamblers speical at Mr. Luckys at Hard Rock Casino, it is not on the menu so ask your waiter, it has steak, shrimp, potatoes, and salad for $7.77. Oh, by the way the traffic in Las Vegas is unreal. At this resort they will ask you to take a 90 minute sales tour. It was the easiest $75 dollars I have ever made. No pressure at all. They show you the units and the cost and there is no pressure at all. If not interested just say no. Las Vegas is growing like you would not belive, and by the way the TRAFFIC IS TERRIBLE. My next vacation I am going somewhere there are no people and no traffic.	
Jun 24 2009 	There are reasons why this hotel is in the Top Ten hotels in Vegas!	I stayed 7 nights in a two bedroom villa and I can't imagine being anywhere else. Our room was on the 19th floor and faced the Planet Hollywood by Westgate tower and the city of vegas, and beyond that the beautiful mountains. Even though our room wasn't exactly facing the Strip, we could see Paris and Bellagio to our left and to our right at night we saw the city lights and then- nothing because of the mountains. It was very interesting to see that. The beds were super comfortable and we had more than enough room. The shuttle to the grocery store only runs saturday thru tuesday or so and only until about 10am. Which worked out well because of our east coast internal clock! It was wonderful to prepare our own meals during the day and then go out for dinner. We spent quite a bit of time at Planet Hollywood since it was so close. We were able to walk everywhere and the valets were very helpful in securing cabs for us. The hotel offers various activites for $5 or less. (i.e. scrapbooking workshop, milkshake making, video game contests) I never once was offered a timeshare which was really nice. In the lobby, they have strawberry water that you can drink. It became kind of a tradition to stop and get some every time we came in from walking. They have free wireless internet and if you need anything printed you can just email it to the front desk and they will print it for free. The pool was quite small but it was never overcrowded while we were there. However, you can go to Planet Hollywood or Polo Towers and use their pool according to the front desk. We never took advantage of that so I'm not sure how that goes but its nice to have the option. They did allow a little early check-in for us but they do not offer late checkout. At the very latest, you're allowed to be there until 11 but the valet will hold your bags for free until you come get them. If you're even vaguely considering the Chateau you should go ahead and book a room!	
Jun 21 2009 	Close enough to the strip	What we liked the most about this hotel was the location. Since is not in the strip itself, you won't have to park two miles away to get to your room and being with young children walk past the casino area as most hotels in Las Vegas. We stayed at a lock off villa, which was big enough for 8 people, gorgeous kitchen and beautifully decorated. Free valet service made a big difference from when we have stayed in other Vegas hotels.This is a great Marriott property that I would recommend to all my family and friends.Swimming pool was extremely small for the hotel size, but who wants to be in an outdoor pool on a 100+ degree weather?	
Jun 17 2009 	Rest in Vegas is possible	Myself, my husband and 2 of our busy friends took a last minute trip to Vegas to get away. We booked a 3 bedroom for 4 of us, it was more then enough space! Everyone had their own room and bathroom. The rooms were clean, huge and nicely appointed. We saved some money by eating breakfast and/or lunch in our room (dining table for 6 and fully equipped kitchen). Tip: Take the shuttle to the grocery! You are literally across the street from Planet Hollywood and the Strip which was close enough for casino action, restaurants, etc. But far enough away from the smoke and noise! It was easy to catch a cab elsewhere for an evening out (we actually split a van with another group to the Palms, cheap). The pool is small, but I didn't book my room for that, so it worked just fine! There is a bar on the roof which is a nice bonus for a sunny afternoon!The staff was very helpful and pleasant to deal with! They are ready to assist with whatever you may need. Plus, there is a kiosk in the lobby to check in and print out your flight boarding pass!!!Overall, I will be staying with this hotel again and recommend it to anyone who like extra space and no smoke!	
Jun 13 2009 	Loved this resort we will definitely return again!	Loved this resort. We stayed on the 21st floor with a view of Las Vegas Boulevard (the Strip). This was a very enjoyable vacation. The location was about a half a block away from the strip, which made things easy if we chose to walk. This resort was well maintained with a fally equipped kitchen with granite counter tops. We stayed in a two bedroom unit, with one of the units being a lock off unit, so there was plenty of privacy. The unit came with a stackable washer and dryer and also a large tub to soak it. How wonderful it was to take a nice hot bubble bath while listening to the stereo and look out the large windows at the view of the strip. The units are nicely decorated and also were equipped with a dvd player and a 42 inch plasma screen television in the living room. The shower was equipped with a dual shower head, for those who would like to take a shower with your mate. The free valet parking was also an extra perk. The valet parking lot attendants were very curtious and accomodating and so were the staff in the lobby. Each time we would pull up in front of the building the attendants would say &quot;Welcome Home.&quot; which I thought was cute. This place definitely feels like a home away from home, only better because they have all the updated amenities. Those that are into fitness and health will really enjoy the fitness center and there is also a roof top swimming pool and sauna with a breathtaking view of the strip. There is also a bar on the roof if you would like to have a nice pool side drink. After staying at the Marriott Grand Chateu, I would never want to stay in a regular hotel room again. I have been spoiled by this lovely resort.Words can not	
Jun 8 2009 	Excellent hotel close to Strip good rate	Although this is a Marriott vacation club, hotel rooms are available. The one bedroom was large, clean and quite comfortable. It's about l/2 block off the Strip and walking distance to all the large hotels and casinos. Price is great for a one-bedroom suite. Highly recommended.	
Jun 3 2009 	Loved the Grand Chateau	We just returned from a 4-day trip. We loved everything about the Grand Chateau - the location is great, an easy walk to the strip. Our 2-bedroom suite was beautiful and spotless. The staff was all very courteous and friendly. We've stayed at different locations on the Strip over the years - this was one of our favorites. Much quieter than the casino hotels, and the fact that it is a non-smoking hotel is a definite plus. So nice to be able to ease into the day with our coffee and comfortable living room. The full-size kitchen is a big plus, even if only using for beverages and snacks. There is a convenience market by the lobby with lots to offer. Also a shuttle that goes several times daily to the Fashion Show Mall and also to the grocery store. The resort offered many activities, although we were too busy to partake in them.	
Jun 2 2009 	GOOD STAY	If you like the Marriott brand stay here. I was very impressed with the room amenities and the availability of services. The pool is extremely small...more like a backyard pool at home. I stayed over memorial weekend. The hotel seemed full but never crowded. Its not nearly as big as some of the hotels in Vegas. No casino or restaurant on property...so if you are looking for that stay somewhere else. I stayed in a one bedroom villa. Just be careful when you book these though. The hotel has some rooms on their website that state &quot;one bedroom villa&quot; but they are actually studios. The studios are cute, but no full kitchen and no large separate tub...so if you are expecting that and you accidentally book a studio you will be dissapointed. Just make sure that you check the room descriptions to be certain to get what you want.The location is fine..but expect to do alot of walking in general. There is a shuttle that will take you to the supermarket and the fashion mall. The shuttle for the supermarket only runs from Sat through Tues..but if you miss it no worries...there is a fully stocked market in the lobby. They carry everything from bread to first aid items. The shuttle to the mall is great because it basically carts you to the other end of the strip...and if you have ever walked it you understand why thats a good thing. I was not so impressed with the front desk staff for numerous reasons. I had a few questions during my stay and they were not at all helpful. Its a good thing that im not the type of person that expects top notch service because you certainly wont get that here. I basically just received a room key and was sent on my way. Its like being in a ritz carlton with motel trained staff if you can imagine that. Beautiful place, lousy employees. Free valet service, but the valet staff was not much better. The hotel was quiet and clean. No rowdy twenty somethings smoking and smelling up the place with their cigarettes and cheap liquor. By the way, the entire property is smoke free..so if you smoke stay somewhere else. Im not kidding. There are no smoking areas in the hotel and no exceptions..and if housekeeping finds as much as a speck of ash or whiff of smoke in the room expect to pay a hefty &quot;cleaning&quot; charge...upwards of 200 bucks in some cases. Some places you can book a smoke free room and get away with smoking. Not here. Trust me. All in all, my stay was pretty good. Minimal complaints. I am a big fan of Marriott properties..so I will stay in one again. This place is a timeshare property..and I did sit through the sales pitch but decided not to buy. Its still pretty new and in good shape but who knows what it will look like in 10 years? Also, only 2 of the 4 quads are up...so when construction begins on quads 3 and 4 I dont think i would want to stay here for the construction noise. City center is going up across the street. HUGE. I counted 10 buildings...its going to be ridiculous when its finished. I didnt hear any construction noise..maybe a truck or two early am but nothing major. Millions of people will be added to the strip. I'm not so sure it's going to be pleasant since they have no plans to widen the sidewalks. Overall, I thought it was an okay place allthough, if I return to Vegas anytime soon I may try somewhere different next time.	
May 23 2009 	Grand Chateau - Crap Shoot and we lost	Let me just start out by saying that I do my research, I call ahead of time and I read all the reviews. In this case, none of that paid off because Marriott does not stand behind their word or stand up for their owners. I am a Marriott owner that requested to be put in one of those rooms you have probably looked at on the other reviews. The tub in the master room, the 2 spiget shower. Sounds nice? Don't count on it. There is a very good chance you will get a 1 bedroom, cramped room with a tub/shower combo that is probably worse than the one you have at home. Interval International and Marriott are just playing the blame game and neither will own up to their mistake. I booked this over 6 months ago and made all the appropriate requests for the room, but since I booked it through Interval, Marriott won't take any ownership in their mistake. Not only do I suggest you not stay at this specific resort, I am also recommending you don't become a Marriott owner. They want to talk to you when they want to sell you something, but as soon as you have a problem they don't stand by you.On a side note, we are being told we have one of the best views in the hotel.....I'm looking at a parking lot and what looks like a war zone right now. the location of this hotel makes it impossible to have a nice view.If you stay here, I wish you look on your crap shoot for a room and in the casino.	
May 1 2009 	Great Place to Stay	We really enjoyed our stay. The room was gorgeous and we had a great view of the strip . . . The huge tub in the bedroom and the shower built for two made it a very romantic place to stay. The view of the strip from the roof is superb. The rooftop bar area is a great place to relax . . . when its not too windy. We were able to enjoy the best of Vegas without having a casino at the bottom of the stairs . . . but the casinos were glose enought that we could enjoy their amenities with ease.	
Apr 26 2009 	No surprises at the Marriott	Whenever I come to Las Vegas I stay here. Two blocks off the strip means a nice getaway from the maddening crowd. A short walk through the mall across the street brings you to one of my favorite Japanese restaurants - Koi in Planet Holllywood. Staff at the Marriott always helpful. If you want the glitz of Vegas then you should stay in one of the casino hotels. Calm = Marriott.	
Apr 14 2009 	NICE!	Absolutely fine experience at the Chateau. Convenient, clean , spacious, relaxing (if you can relax in Vegas!), etc.,etc., etc., ....Stayed for a week....loved it!	
Apr 13 2009 	Great Place - wanted to stay longer...	This Apartment-Hotel is really amazing. We had a two-bedroom suite with large living-room with a large flat tv, fully equipped kitchen and two luxurious bathrooms. There was a washing machine and a dryer also which was very useful.The location of the building is perfect, as it is a little bit off the Strip to be quiet, but still close enough to walk to all the hotels/casinos.Internet &amp; valet parking was free!	
Apr 8 2009 	Huge Rooms!	My wife and I stayed here for three days. The rooms are Villas, so they are much larger than a regular hotel room. The pictures on the site do not do it justice. The rooms are much larger than they appear. We loved the oversized tub, especially after a day of walking, soaking in it was so relaxing. It is less than a block a way from the strip, it is so close, yet you won't hear any noise, not even from the neighboring rooms. It is in a very good location. The rooms are well appointed with two LCD screen tvs, a six person dinning room table, a sound system and DVD player. The hotel offers free shuttle service to the shopping mall on the strip, use it!! Especially when you are tired of walking and need a ride back to the hotel.The fitness center is very roomy and has free weights and cardio machines with lots of TVs where you can choose what you want to see. It also has lockers, showers, and saunas.The staff was always very helpful in answering questions and even provided discount coupons for shows or places we wanted to visit. I'm definitely coming back.	
Apr 5 2009 	Loved the Grand Chateau	My wife and I had the 2BR, 2Bath Villa for one week. The hotel was very clean. Having a smoke-free hotel was a big plus in our opinion considering all the smoke in most casinos. It was quiet. The location was excellent. We considered the room to be high quality and luxurious. The room was stocked with everything you need. We ordered groceries from Albertson's which worked out very well for getting food and liquor to our room inexpensively. The double glass shower was great with fabulous water pressure. The tub was also nice. We had a strip view from the room. The rooftop bar was great too with fabulous views of the strip and beyond. The Wi-Fi worked great. And we have to mention the staff which was very responsive and professional at all times. All-in-all a classy, high-quality place to stay in Las Vegas that should continue to be highly recommended.	
Mar 29 2009 	Clean Comfortable and Quiet	This is a great place to stay if you love Vegas but love a good night's sleep as well. Very quiet at night and no noisy revelers wandering the halls unlike the other hotels on the Strip. Great location next to Planet Hollywood. The rooms are spotless and have all the amenities of a Marriott Hotel (except a restaurant and room service!). A 2 bedroom unit will very comfortably sleep 6-7. The staff was helpful and pleasant, and the free shuttle to the grocery store was convenient. The rooftop pool has a beautiful view during the day and at night.	
Mar 29 2009 	Dynamite !!!! Loved this place......	The location can't be beat..... close enough to the LAS VEGAS STRIP to walk but yet far enough from the smoke and craziness that comes with Las Vegas...........We had a 2 BR 2 BA suite which was impeccably clean, the beds super comfy and the construction of the buildg was superb.... we couldn't hear a thing. The front desk staff was wonderful..... when we couldn't figure out how to work the DVD late one night..... the front desk people sent up a &quot;technician&quot; who couldn't have been nicer.........upon leaving he left us his card and a piece of chocolate !!! We were treated like royalty........Wow..... I think that I should work for the Marriott...	
Mar 26 2009 	Great Hotel that doesn't feel like dirty conventiony vegas	Absolutely loved the Marriott. I stay in Marriotts frequently and this one was great! the rooms are huge..maybe we got a suite i am not sure. Double Headed showers, kitchen area, living and dining area. Quiet too..did not hear construction once. Great Staff, from the valet (female sorry misser her name)-to the front desk (Nick maybe), to the engineers who actually engaged you in conversation and acknowleded you. Loved the fact that it did not reek of smoke. Pool...eh crowded and small but i wasn't there for that... we were there to visit with friends, watch some games, and hit some casinos. It is right across the street from Planet Hollywood Hotel and Mile Shops.	
Mar 24 2009 	Clean room and good location	My spouse and I stayed at this hotel for three nights as part of the timeshare presentation promotion. The studio room we stayed was very clean. Studio rooms are not equipped with washer/dryer, but there are several free washer/dryers inside the hotel. The fitness center is equipped with up-to-date equipment and sauna. The hotel does not automatically provide the wash cloth for the bathroom, but provided upon request. Since you have so many choices of hotels in Las Vegas with good deals, I think the regular price for the studio room is a bit high. It's a well maintained timeshare property that might provide a good value for a family or group of people who want to use kitchen to save money.	
Mar 24 2009 	A great location at the Las Vegas Strip	Stayed here for a week in the middle of january of 2009. The weather was really great for the time of year. Usually it is not so wonderfull. So many short sleeved people. The Marriott is not on bat at the Strip. With a 1 to 2 minute walk you're on the Strip. It is located behind the Harley Davidson restaurant. This Marriott is one of the Vacationclub resorts from Marriott, but with a few different detaild. First of all: the location: it is probably located better then most vacationclub resorts. Often they are away from the city centers or places of interest, so you need a car. (Well, some are on the beach, which can be a good location if you just want to relax). Here the parking is valet parking, which works very well. And it can be handy to use a car to get around (shopping malls or even other hotels on the strip... the strip is long...).We were with friends and stayed in a two bedroom apartment. The views are nice. The two bedroom appartment a bit smaller then in an average vacationclub (the kitchen and living room area for instance), but you get all you need, as always. The rooms look nice, the kitchen is handy (for some shopping and taking breakfast and a late night snack). What we enjoyed in Vegas? Premium Outlet, O by Cirque du Soleil, V the Variety show (the show, not the theatre...), the strip: Wynn, Venetian, Bellagio, Attraction on the Stratosphere, Rollercoaster at New York New York, Vic and Anthony steakhouse, the great january 2009 weather... Grand CanyonWhat we did not enjoy so much in Vegas? the older hotels: such as: Luxor, Excalibur (at a certain moment all those casinos look the same: in which hotel did we just enter?) , the fact we got hit by a car on our way back to the airport and had to stay in a hospital and the insane hospital bills we get since (let's abuse the tourist!)	
Mar 22 2009 	Excellent location and lodging.	Impressive lobby, attentive staff and cleanliness of the room made this an excellent choice. My husband and I shared a studio with a king-size bed, large closet, easy-to-use safe and kitchen area with small refrigerator, microwave and an assortment of dishes and glasses.	
Mar 20 2009 	Very Pleased	We spent one week here on an Interval International exchange. We traveled with our two small children age 5 and 8. We were very pleased with the resort but were concerned about the pool after reading the reviews about how small it was. It is small, but we had a blast. The pool is located on the roof, with a great view, a bar, a hot tub and the pool. There were plenty of other kids for our kids to play with and we could keep an eye on them from our lounges. If you've been on a cruise, it's similar to a pool environment on a cruise ship. There were fun people to visit with and a bar a few steps away. The one bedroom was large. While we w ould have liked a two bedroom, we had plenty of room. The staff was great and there were plenty of activities in the kids center ( art's and crafts, movies, treasure hunts, ect.) The only addition I'd like to see is some self parking. Currently there is only valet. While the valet is free, we were pretty active coming and going so after a week the tips paid to the valet's started to add up. I'd set aside a stash of $1 bills for this.We will definitely stay here again.	
Mar 11 2009 	A dream come true!	Our apartment at the Marriott Grand Chateau was fabulous. The apartment is large, beautiful and spotlessly clean. The beds were comfortable with luxurious linens. The enormous soaking tub and two-person shower were delightful. The kitchen was very well equipped. Hotel staff was helpful, friendly and honest. Anytime we needed something for the apartment, it was delivered quickly. Once, I asked for extra towels, then left the apartment without realizing my cash and credit cards were laying on the kitchen counter. They were never touched! And when I had trouble connecting to the free wi-fi, the front desk connected me to a free IBM help desk that solved my problem.The store downstairs is well stocked, and there's also an ABC store in the Planet Hollywood mall across the street. I swam in the rooftop pool almost every day. Incredible view and location: close to the strip, yet quiet. We look forward to staying here again!	
Mar 10 2009 	Great location and amenities - would highly recommend!	Just spent along weekend with old friends at this lovely hotel. I was concerned about whether it would be close enough to the strip but we walked everywhere. It was about a block off the strip, but right in the center and convenient to everything. After walking around casinos for hours, it was nice to walk in the lobby get right on the elevator and go upstairs. We (5 women) had the two-bedroom suite and it was perfect for a group. We could gather in the living room, make coffee and bagels in the morning. Frig for drinks, etc. The hotel is well decorated, upscale and has a great 24-hour market in the lobby. No sign of any construction despite their website warning. Pool on the roof was small, but adequate.	
Mar 5 2009 	Great location and all the amenities you could want in a suite	We stayed in a one bedroom suite for a week in February 2009 and were very pleased! We've always stayed at hotels (MGM, TheHotel, Rio, Luxor, TI, Excalibur, even Stratosphere once to check it out) so were hesitant at what my timeshare could offer us in Vegas. A great big space with everything we needed in a perfect location is what we got! The entire suite is decorated in brand new, clean sunny modern sort of country french design (don't worry, it's not frilly or flowered). The kitchen is fully stocked for all your needs - I made dinner for two and even breakfast for six one morning. Special note - if you are making bacon do it in the microwave. There's no real exhaust for smoke which resulted in us setting off the really loud smoke alarm but hotel staff responded IMMEDIATELY with friendly and very nice assistance.The dining room seats 6 comfortably. The living room has a comfortable couch, two chairs, and tables and a flat screen TV with a ton of cable channels. We actually stayed in once or twice to relax and watched a movie or two - very nice. The entire hotel has free WiFi - a nice touch that really came in handy. The bedroom is huge, with another big tv, comfortable bed with nice linens and good pillows, well lighted vanity area, and a really big two person jacuzzi. The separate bathroom has a two person, two shower head shower that was awesome. Our view out the bedroom and living room was of City Center on the strip and the side of Planet Hollywood and beyond - including a slice of the Bellagio fountains. My only gripe is that there is no full length mirror - come on, it's a must for getting dressed up for a night out in Vegas! The rooftop has a bar (open 11am to 6pm) with several tables and chairs, and 6-8 person hot tub and a small but fine sized pool (open from something like 7am to 11pm) with lounge chairs. We liked the day and night view from the roof - you can bring up your own wine and chill out while watching most of the Strip lights, from Mandalay Bay up to Caesar's and beyond. There's also a 24-hour fitness center but between Vegas fun and the ultra comfort of our suite, we never quite got there to check it out. As for location - this place is right behind the Harley Davidson Restaurant &amp; parking lot located on the corner of Harmon and the Strip, across from the new City Center. Unless you cannot walk 90 seconds of a block, there is no reason to call this hotel &quot;off the strip.&quot; Think of it this way - if you are staying &quot;on the strip&quot; at the MGM, you enter on the strip and then have to walk to the back of the hotel to check in or get to elevators so you've just walked 2 blocks indoors. At the Marriott, you are simply not walking through a casino. And if you chose not to walk the short block up to the Strip, but instead to cross Harmon Ave, you can enter Planet Hollywood &amp; the shops through a side door located directly across (i.e., about 50 feet) from the Marriott's entrance. Marriott guests can use Planet Hollywood's pools and gym for free too. Check out Planet Hollywood's players club - when you join you get a ridiculous amount of free drink &amp; $$ off the buffet coupons as well as free food and retail coupons. With the free drink coupons alone, we saved over $100! Also check out Planet Hollywood's buffet (since the Marriott does not have any restaurants). We were pleasantly surprised by how good the PH buffet was - the dessert bar even has cotton candy!Overally, Marriott Service was friendly and professional. Valet parking attendants and bellhops were great. One of them even gave us the name and number of a nightclub hostess who hooked us up with VIP service and a private table at Ghostbar at the Palms later that week. Score!	
Mar 4 2009 	Excellent Stay at an excellent place!	I am writing this as I am looking out the window at the strip. The Marriott Grand Chateau is a great place to stay while in Vegas. This is our 5th time in Vegas and our first stay at MGC. We are staying in a one bedroom unit which has a full kitchen. Overall the MGC is in a very convenient location, close to most everything including transportation options. I like the free wireless internet service. There is no room service or housecleaning but we really do not miss that at all. When we needed extra towels we called for them and they were delivered within 30 minutes. Albertsons will deliver groceries plus there is a store downstairs next to the lobby. We ate breakfast and lunch in the room most days so we could splurge on dinner. The roof top pool offers great views of the city. Like I said this is an excellent place to stay!	
Mar 1 2009 	Very clean 2 min walk to strip	Loved this place. The beds are very comfortable. The room is spotless and I am hard to please in that category. Located next to Planet Holywood's Miracle Mile which has incredible shopping and lots of choices in affordable dining. We will stay here if we ever come again. Only drawback-no daily maid service. Free wireless in the room, free toll free calling and free valet parking.	
Feb 28 2009 	Great resort just off the strip!	Resort was just off the strip but within walking distance. The room was very clean and the service was great. The room was very comfortable with every ammenity (washer &amp; dryer, flat screen tv's in all the rooms, microwave etc...) The master bathroom had a double headed shower and a large tub in the master bedroom, but did not have a jacuzzi :( Valet parking is the only way in and out with a car. The staff hustled to get your vehicle promptly. Only had to wait more than 5 minutes once during the entire week.The resort offers great views of the strip from the pool that is located on the roof. The pool was small and the sky bar is only open til 6pm :(The resort has activities for younger kids, but not for teenagers. This resort offers a smoke free environment with no casino and no restaurant.	
Feb 24 2009 	Comfort location 	We are Marriot owners and traded out a 2br in Ft. Lauderdale for a 1br at the Grand Chateau and were quite pleased. Well appointed and decorated. Kitchen and bathroom were roomy, and with quality appliances and fixtures. Check in and check out was a breeze, and the staff was very helpful...especially when I pulled the dumb guy move and forgot it was Valentines day...(...we were in Vegas after all...all the days run together). Anyway, Paul...I think that was his name...at the concierge jumped through hoops to help me out...I mean, save my butt! As most reviewers have said the location is ideal. 1 block off the strip, which definately cuts down on the noise. (see my photos) Also, all the other reviews were very helpful regarding groceries, etc...so I won't rehash all that. We were in town for a photogaraphy conference which was being held at the MGM and it was maybe a 10 minute walk to get there. Bally's is about 15 minute walk...the show at the Jubilee Theater is a must...traditional Vegas! During our stay I'd estimate occupancy was only about 30% so it was very quiet. The weather was cold 35 -45 degrees, and windy with occasional showers. Pretty crummy weather, but the bar on the roof was open a few hours during the day...the bartenders weren't happy to be there...can't blame 'em I guess, I hate cold weather too! I just ordered more cocktails and enjoyed the view...the view from the rooftop is incredible! Great for photos! Again, as most reviewers have said the pool is small...there weren't many people in while we were there and I certainly wasn't going to venture in..although it is heated. I'll include a good picture of the rooftop. I really only have one suggestion...don't use the ice in the freezer's automatic ice maker. Dump it out in the sink, wash the bin, and use the public ice machine...on our floor it was right by the elevators. I live in Costa Rica and think I've got an iron stomach...but it wasn't enough to combat the water in Las Vegas. All in all, as I said at the top we were quite pleased, and when we get back to Vegas we'll be staying at the Chateau.	
Feb 19 2009 	Time Share with Great Location and Service	First off, this property is a Marriott Timeshare so dont expect full service amenities such as a restaurant, room service, etc. However this property does offer complimentary valet and bell service and has a small marketplace with goodies and Starbucks coffee and Concierges to help you with your vacation activities.We had a guest unit/studio. This was alright for us for just 2 nights. The unit had a small frig, microwave, sink, plates, glasses, and coffee maker. The guest unit has a king bed. We found the unit to be really clean and comfortable. The guest unit has an ordinary shower. Not the &quot;his and hers&quot; shower heads in the Master Villa.Valet service was quick despite the long line of people checking out after a Presidents Day weekend. They worked their hardest to get our vehicle. The property has a shuttle which can take you to the Fashion Show Mall on the north end of the strip near Treasure Island and Wynn/Encore. Shuttle driver knew all the shortcuts to get around the parking lot that is the Strip.Used the concierge service and never once was asked to attend a timeshare presentation. Thank goodness! We already own at Marriott Canyon Villas in Phoenix and dont need another week.The property had a gym with treadmills, weights, elliptical machines, and bikes. Steam rooms in the locker rooms. Nice equipment. Internet service is wireless.For tickets to shows, I recommend going to &quot;Tickets 4 Tonight&quot; which has various store fronts on the Strip. Actually there is one about a block away from this property. Ask the concierge where the closest location is. We used this to get 2 for 1 tickets to see Louie Anderson stand up comedy. We also saw that they sold discounted tickets to &quot;O&quot;, Elton John, Love, Cris Angel, Blue Man Group, Excalibur Knights of the Round Table, etc. The only problem is that they give you a voucher and you have to run over to the box office for the show that you are seeing to get a seat assignment. They also sell discounted passes to buffets. I recommend that you stop here if you come to Vegas.	
Feb 18 2009 	Would love to go back!	The location of this hotel was good....just a short walk from the strip. Rooms were very nice as was the hotel overall. The pool was nothing to talk about and there was no restaurant but we weren't there for the pool and there are so many restaurants around we really didn't miss one not being on the property. Overall we had a wonderful experience and would stay there again.	
Feb 2 2009	Ladies weekend in Las Vegas - GREAT	We have just returned from a week at the Marriott Grand Chateau via timeshare swap thru Marriott. The resort is about 50% complete in construction - but please do not let this push you off. The rooms are top-notch with all employees/concierge services VERY ATTENTIVE &amp; ACCOMIDATING. We stayed on the 25th floor with great views - Bar and Pool on the roof for evening drinks ...BYOB your own bottle of wine saving a few dollrs from hitting the clubs on tthe strip later in the evening. This resot is nice for no SLOT MACHINES in the hotel - but just 1/2 block away at the Plant Hollywodd with all gambeling amenities. The Mircle Mile of Shops are across the street - allowing easy acess to resturants/shopping. There are kids activities MAIZE - adults too in painting your own wine and shot-glasses - and resort is very clean with great security - 24-Hr free valet parking a real plus.Overall I would say this is great for a group/family to relax with 1,2,3-Bedroom suites and full kitchen for entertaining - and allowing a home base for everyone to partake in the Las Vegas experiance.	
Jan 27 2009 	Great Location Great Hotel	This is one of the nicest Marriott Timeshares in the system. This is however a timeshare with no restaurant or room service. Located next to Planet Hollywood Casino you are just minutes from the miracle mile shops. One of the best equipped timeshares we have stayed at as far as the room goes. There are no barbeque grills at the property, this being the only downfall for us. The pool is very small but located on the roof, great place to have coffee in the morning. Taxis are always ready out front, and valet parking is free and fast. Staff was great, front desk was always ready to serve. A nice way to go to vegas and not be in the casinos the whole trip. Again a timeshare not a full service Marriott.	
Jan 25 2009 	Fantastic Option on the Strip!	We are Vegas regulars, and you won't find a better option for families than staying at the Grand Chateau. There's no gambling machines, the staff is friendly, and having your own kitchen and family room is a huge bonus for those of us that don't like to eat out 3 times a day. It's right across the street from Planet Hollywood's big shopping mall, so it's perfectly located.This is where we'll be staying every time we go to Vegas with the kids!	
Jan 17 2009 	Villa on the strip	The one bedroom was large and very comfortable and the pool on the roof was terrific and not very crowded. The prperty itself was disappointing int hat it did nto have any restuarants and a very limtied market. It is possible they willa dd services but nothing much was open. For a hotel/timeshare this large there was very little acitvities or options.	
Jan 3 2009 	Really Enjoyed Our Stay. Loved the double head shower!	My wife and I traded our week in the Grand Vista in Orlando for a week at the Grand Chateau. We really enjoyed it. While the room is not as big as other Marriott &quot;Grand&quot; Timeshares, this was still much nicer than most rooms on the strip. Our 1 bedroom unit had a functional kitchen, a European washer and dryer and very nice furnishings. They have full size washer and dryers in the building if your need them. The property has free Wi-Fi. The property is expanding and there is construction at the Planet Hollywood (across the street) so ask for a quiet room. The roof top pool is a bit small, but the view at night is great. You can use the Planet Hollywood pool, but that pool is only open till Oct 31. Everyone we dealt with at the Marriott was great as always. Suggestions. They have a shuttle bus to take you food shopping. I forget the name of the food store chain, but while the prices were much better than on the strip, they are a bit higher than normal. Nonetheless, we stocked up on food and adult beverages to enjoy in the room. If you plan on gambling at places other than Planet Hollywood (across the street) or MGM (10 min), I suggest you get a small rental car and park at the casinos free lots. Cabs will be $10 at least each way. We found it hard to get a cab at certain times due to a big conference. There is a monorail that appears to be close, but it really is a 10-15 min walk to the station and will cost $5 per ride or $15 for an unlimited day pass. We spent most of this trip at some of the older casinos- Gold Coast, Osheas, Golden Nugget, Casino Royal (our favorite place to play black jack and craps due to the low limits). We also went to the Red Rock Canyon a nice day trip.	
Jan 3 2009	December Vacation in a different location for us!	We visit Las Vegas a lot and usually stay on the strip. We have stayed in many Marriott time shares and have been pleased. This 1 bedroom was big and had everything and was so much better then a strip hotel. The bathroom shower had beautiful beige tile. The bed was comfortable and the sheets were so soft!. There was no maid service, but we did not care, I did take the garbage out a few times, and made the bed, even tho I was on vacation. The unit had a full kitchen, even a dishwasher. I so enjoyed morning coffee, they even left coffee filters and some coffee. The location of the Timeshare is perfect, so if you do trade for this place, do not worry about the location. It is 2 minutes off the strip, a perfect location. I would stay here again. The place was clean, bright , cheerful, and staff friendly. This is Marriott at its BEST	
Dec 30 2008 	DISAPPOINTED RUDE SERVICE!!	I haven't been this disappointed with one of the properties ever, and we stay at Marriott hotels around the world more than 75 nights per year. The hotel wasn't even close to being ready to open, staff wasn't trained properly, incomplete room furnishings/amenties, major construction during peak check-in times, etc. It wasn't what was advertised, and we could have stayed at the Bellagio for much less!! We walked in to find the main fountain in the lobby undergoing major construction, where the dust was flying all over us, not to mention it was very noisy. We had just finished a six hour drive and were looking forward to a glass of wine, but there was NO service available (restaurant or bar), due to rain. At that point, we asked if we could be transfered to another Marriott and the assistant front desk clerk, Sang Han became quite arrogant and said we'd be charged for the night in each hotel, due to their cancellation policy. When we asked to speak to his manager (Tom), he told us we'd have to wait until the Monday following Thanksgiving (5 days). It got worse from there. We had a 7am flight the next morning and never received our wake up call. Basic amenities weren't available: no glasses in room, no full length mirror, can't call ahead to valet for car, and cheap, tacky decor. Doesn't do the other Vegas Marriott's any justice.Waste of $$$!	
Dec 14 2008 	Great Hotel!!!!	The hotel is very nice I would very much stay there again. Its a little off the main strip area so you dont get all the noise and traffic but close enough you can walk to the strip. I had a 1 Bedroom suite and I loved the 2 person shower and the soaking tub. My friends would have to pound on the door each morning to make sure I didnt fall asleep in the tub watching the flat screen in the bedroom. They have classes during the week for people staying there like one call was for 20 dollars the bar on the roof teaches you how to make some of your favorite mixed drinks.The little store in the lobby was nice for little things but I would suggest find a normal grocery store and stock up so you dont spend an arm and a leg each morning for breakfast lunch and dinner. The beds were amazing I slept in all the time. The fully stocked kitchen was great even had a pizza cutter to my surprise. In the lobby they have water with fruit floating in it and it tastes so good. Staff was beyond nice and I always had more towels then I knew what to do with. In all a great stay!!. .FYI. .Vegas is Expensive!	
Oct 29 2008 	Great location great place!	I have to agree with everyone else that has commented on how wonderful the Chateau is. The location is a short one block walk to the strip or do what we did and cut thru the Miracle Mile shops at Planet Hollywood Casino to get to the strip. The only thing I want to add (and the reason for my review) is there is a small market inside Planet Hollywood called ABC store that you can shop for essentials (milk, juice), booze (beer, wine, liquor) and snacks. I mention it b/c it is WAY WAY cheaper than the market inside the Chateau. Do yourself a favor and go to ABC if you need to stock your kitchen inside the Chateau but don't want to break the bank to do it. It is what my wife and I did during our entire stay.	
Oct 15 2008 	Loved our stay here	loved the Marriott Grand Chateau! we go to Vegas a few times a year (from Canada) and usually stay at the Hilton when exchanging our timeshare, but the hilton is right at the end of the strip so was excited when the Marriott opened. The location is great! its a 1 min walk to the side of the Planet Hollywood mall which is full of great shops and restaurants. To the actual strip its 3 mins at the most. Seeing as most of the hotels on the strip are massive and set back from the actual road the time from Marriott to strip would be the same as MGM hotel room to strip.The only negative thing would be at night you have to walk down a road to the hotel rather than through a hotel, would not suggest that for women on their own at night...better to go through the planet hollywood mall to the side entrance or take a cab if late at night. Whenever I was walking late at night with my husband down the street there were always people around, but I did think to myself I would not feel comfortable without my hubby there. This is not a huge deal just the only negative thing I could think of about this location.The one bedroom suite was like an apartment, it was amazing to come home to every day and felt more like 'home' than a hotel room. Having a full kitchen saved us money as we went to the grocery store the first day so we didnt have to have every meal out. The room was on-par with any of the rooms Ive stayed in the MGM, Luxor etc. but obviously way bigger! Theres a large TV in the living room area and a smaller one in the master. Nice large tub that fits 2 in the master. Shower has a 2 shower head either side!The hotel has a shuttle that goes to the grocery store and to the Fashion Mall opposite the Wynn so very convenient.I would definitely stay here when I come back to Vegas. Unlike other timeshare hotels we were not bothered about going to a presentation at all (just a few phonecalls) and the staff were extremely nice. My hubby needed to send a fax and the front desk guy was so helpful printing it for us for no charge.definitely recommend the Grand Chateau!	
Oct 6 2008 	Wonderful Resort	We exchanged our timeshare for the Grand Chateau the week of Sept 21-28. I loved every aspect of this resort and plan to return there next year. The staff was absolutely wonderful, the room was immaculate. The bed was the most comfortable bed I have ever had and so clean and fresh. The view from the rooftop bar area was gorgeous. The pool was small, but at check in we were told we could make use of larger pools at the Polo Towers and Planet Hollywood if we chose to. No need on our part as we did not come to Las Vegas to swim...lol. They are expanding the property and will have 2 new pools in the next year, so do not count them out if you like to swim. The location is perfect with easy access to the entire strip area. The valet young men were so nice and helpful with directions. I cannot say enough great things about our stay. We did have a one bedroom and so we were really able to spread out and feel at home. The place is very clean, well staffed and just an absolute great place to stay. I hope you enjoy it as much as we did.	
Sep 26 2008 	Home on the Strip	We exchanged our Hilton Head week for a week at the Grand Chateau. We could not have been more impressed. The property is located right off the Strip,directly across the street from Planet Hollywood. MGM, New York New York, Excalibur, Luxor, Mandalay Bay, Monte Carlo and Paris are a very easy walk away. The staff was extremely pleasant. We were asked once - and only once - whether or not we would like to listen to a timeshare presentation. Since we had our days pretty well booked with our guests, we declined and were not asked again. However, we will probably buy at this resort in the future. Currently, two of the four towers are completed and construction on the remaining towers has not begun, so there is no construction noise. We had a two bedroom unit with a full kitchen which was very well appointed. The washer and dryer were small and a full load in the dryer took a long time to dry so I would suggest drying several small loads rather than one large one. The master bedroom is large and had one of Marriott's super comfortable beds. The shower in the master bath had dual shower heads. The living/dining room had a nice table for a meal and a large flat screen tv.There is only a small store with a limited selection of groceries onsite, so if you want to stock up, take advantage of the free shuttle to a nearby grocery store. There is valet parking only, but the valets were incredible. If we called down, the car was always waiting for us. If we didn't call first it took no longer than five minutes to get our car. Don't miss the view at night from the rooftop pool area - and while you're there have a drink at the bar. The pool and hot tub were small but never seemed to be crowded. We plan to return to Vegas in two years and will only stay at the Grand Chateau!	
Sep 17 2008 	did the time share thing	The check in was quick and efficient, and the studio room was nice. I really wanted a 1 bedroom and was told we were getting a 1 bedroom, but oh well, glad I didn't bring my brother and his wife as was planned, there wouldn't have been a place to sleep. There were no washer/dryers in this studio either. Efficiency kitchen was satisfactory. The little store downstairs didn't have much. Walking across the street to the planet holllywood or out 2 blocks to catch a bus were other options. I wasn't impressed. We stayed on the 33rd floor overlooking the strip and all the construction, not a pretty view right now. Didn't like the fact the pool and bar were on the roof. The time share presentation was no pressure and the units are nice that they are showing, and the prices aren't bad. We have Westin timeshare in Maui and Hilton in Las Vegas, so decided we didn't need another one.	
Sep 8 2008 	Fantastic	We made a reservation in another timeshare place about 3 miles off the strip. Huge mistake!!! (Maybe more on that later). Moved to the Grand Chateau on day 2. Stayed in a lock-off room that can sleep 4. (There were 2 of us). This was far above your average hotel room. Very spacious, spotless, comfortable bed with great linens, well equipped kitchenette, huge bathroom, fantastic view of the strip from the 30th floor! All in all....true Marriott quality. Valet parking is very convienient. All of the staff is A+. Very easy walk to the strip through the Miracle Mile Mall (great shops) and Planet Hollywood. The Marriott does not yet have a restaurant up and running but it's in their future plans. If you need something...go inside the mall. There are a ton of great resturants and many of them serve breakfast. Try the &quot;Earl of Sandwich&quot; for a quick bite to eat. Best sandwiches I've ever had! We heard no construction noise. Marketplace store in the lobby seemed to be open all night if you need anything. We would definately stay here again if we ever go back to Las Vegas.	
Sep 7 2008 	comfort convenience and a touch of home	my wife and i just concluded a week long stay at the chateau as we traded in on an interval exchange and we were quite satisfied with all the place had to offer. we generally stay at the hilton and generally go to vegas 2-3 times a year but opted for a change as we like the home style amenities a timeshare can offer. in general timeshare properties in vegas are well off the strip. this is just right. the side door to the miracle mile at planet hollywood is across the street. and yes the current pool is small and if travelling during a peak family period it could get interesting for space, but there is a larger one on the way over the garage, when i'm not sure. the view from the rooftop pool/bar at nite is what u travelled there for...if u are a photo taker there is a view of the south strip which is spectacular. a note about slot play...my wife and i are seasoned slot players and lets face it these large hotels are not built by the contributions of winners. we have found the slot play at the casinos on fremont st to be far more generous. so play a bit as u walk through the pyramids of the 21st century but save your money for fitzgeralds or the 4 queens. the rat pack returns and barbara and frank: the concert that never was shows are highly recommended for entertainment versus cost.	
Aug 20 2008 	Fantastic vacation Location	My Family and I just spent a week at the Chateau! Great experience. After walking in 111 degree weather the ice water w/cucumbers in the lobby was really refreshing. The staff, especially the concierge staff (Pamela and Tanya) were super in helping us. Yes the current pool on the roof is small - until the new one is completed. In the meantime you can use 2 hotels nearby. Construction was not a problem. However this week they plan on knocking out a wall (now that tower 2 is complete) to expand the lobby so that could be problematic. I highly recommend this as a location to stay in vegas. It's right off the strip near Planet Hollywood	
Aug 18 2008 	Beware not a typical hotel	First, let me say I am a devoted Marriott guest. I have stayed in Marriott properties from the JW to the Fairfield Inn and I stay in Marriott properties because of the consistency in quality.However, I will never stay at the Grand Chateau again. I went to the property for a timeshare preview and received a smaller studio room. That was okay by me, although I would have preferred the larger one-bedroom.The property has some positives. It's hard to beat the location, although there is some construction noise during the day, it is not overbearing. You can easily walk across the street to Planet Hollywood and there are several casinos in walking distance. The rooms themselves are nice and the bathrooms are more than acceptable.My problem stems with the service. Maybe Vegas hotels can afford to be a little less than accomodating because people will always go there to visit and they are still building hotels left and right so if one properties doesn't get your business somebody else will certainly follow, especially on weekends.But I had a major problem with housekeeping in my room. I went out and when I came back the carpet around my kitchenette was soaked and the water seeped into my closet. Housekeeping left towels on the floor to soak up the water, but no explanation followed. We complained and the hotel moved us to a similar room (another studio) paid for cleaning the wet clothes in the closet. We were late for a dinner appointment because of the problem and were disappointed that we didn't get an upgrade in room for our troubles.We did complain to the manager the next morning and we got half off our room rate. That said, in a city known for comps, I don't understand why we didn't get a better room or get the room comped for one night. The night valet service was also lacking and very slow, even though there weren't many cars on a Sunday night.I am still loyal to Marriotts but next time I will go to the JW or Marriott Suites. I believe the management there (and I've stayed in both places over the years) serve their customers better. Also, with everything that happened, I would be very reluctant to buy a timeshare at that Marriott property.	
Aug 17 2008 	The Marriott Grand Chateau is wonderful	We stayed at the Marriott Grand Chateau last week of July and just loved it....the Vacation Club property was beautiful and well run. The help at the front desk is excellent and very accommodating.Our one bedroom with kitchen was awesome...so clean and beds were so comfortable...the kitchen was nicely furnished with dishes, supplies, etc...the washer and dryer was nice to have so that we didn't have to pack such big suitcases....The lobby was beautiful and nice to sit and relax or wait for family. An added touch was two water coolers with sliced cucumbers....nothing better to drink when you come in from the hot, hot Las Vegas temperatures....nice touch.The location is wonderful....Planet Hollywood is across the street with the wonderful Miracle Mile Shoppes....an ABC Store is there with all the items you could possibly need at a good price...Marriott Grand Chateau also has a store in lobby which was nice but a bit more expensive.....Free valet service which was superb...valets were wonderful and very organized and efficient.Also, a Walgreen's closeby to develop photos or pick up souvenirs, food items, etc.....best Walgreens I have ever been to.....Only negative would be the size of swimming pool...it is on the rooftop and quite breathtaking at night, however, the pool isn't like most found at resorts but does have a nice bar...Marriott will eventually build a pool once all the timeshare towers are complete.We would definitely return as it is in a very convenient location back from the strip but near everything.A great Marriott Vacation Club.	
Aug 13 2008 	Would go back	Myself along with husband, a 25 year old and 21 year old stayed in a 2 bedroom. Could not pick a better location to the strip. Rooms were clean and had everything you could ask for. Beds were comfortable.We had a concern over valet parking but it was never an issue. Tipping wasn't necessary. Fitness centre was fabalous, could not find any fault with it. Marketplace Food store too pricey but shopping centre was close by. Pool was small and too hot without any shade and too many people in the pool. However, you can use the pools at Planet Holloywood, ask at front desk.Overall, great place, great location and facilities.	
Aug 4 2008 	Great Las Vegas location	Stayed here over Memorial Day 2008. Were told the facility was at 98% occupancy. Absolutely excellent stay. From check in to check out there were no issues.  We had a three bedroom unit with a spectacular view of the Las Vegas experience; our unit was clean as it could be, the kitchen was equipped really well and the cooking utensils were of high quality; the bathrooms were a treat and the furnishings were more than adequate for our large group. Hotel staff were helpful, polite and prompt. The elevator wait was minimal, the valet service was quick and well organized. A great job by the resident management and team.	
Jul 26 2008 	Just Wonderful!	We stayed in the 2/2 suite in this resort and absolutely LOVED it!The rooms are very spacious and nicely furnished. The beds feel oh so soft. Both bedrooms have private bathrooms. The master bathroom has a large tub and shower with dual shower heads. Even the towels were above par. We were on the 32nd floor and had a fabulous view of New York New York, MGM Grand, and the Excalibur. The hotel is in a perfect spot... very close to the strip but without the crowds and traffic other hotels on the strip offer. The front desk clerks are superb - we arrived at the hotel a bit early (9am) and even though check in isnt until 4pm, they let us in our suite.Vegas in July is h.o.t.... and for this the lobby offers refreshing flavored water to keep you cool. Who knew that adding sliced cucumbers to a pitcher of water tasted so good? Lol.There is a lot of construction going on but it wasnt an inconvenience at all. We didnt hear any noise and it was kind of entertaining watching the cranes lift the glass panes on to the buildings.The pool sucked... but I think they are working on building another one...There is not a casino in the resort - which we liked. It makes the place quiet and keeps the place from getting overcrowded. And slots and tables are only steps away on the strip.... Along with some tasty places to eat - including the Spice Market Buffet in PH... very yummy... We will definitely book our next Vegas trip here again!	
Jul 17 2008	Nice place just off the strip	Nice place to stay. Some construction however but the management quickly satisfied us by moving us to a different room. The rooms are very cleanin a studio apartment style.	
Jul 2 2008 	Bought Timeshare!	I stayed at the Marriott Grand Chateau from Friday, June 27th through Monday, June 30th with my husband.We normally stay at the JW Marriott which is several miles away from the strip. This was the first time we were actually staying on the strip (well, 1 block off) and were quite nervous that it was going to be a bit too crazy for us (I am 5 months pregnant). We stayed at the Grand Chateau after receiving a 3 night/4 day offer as long as we attended the timeshare presentation.We were very relieved when we arrived at the Grand Chateau. It was very close to all the action but tucked away enough that we were not bothered by the crowds. Rooms: We had a 1 bedroom unit which was very clean and large! We really didn't take advantage of the full kitchen or washer and drier but it would be a great thing to have if our stay was a bit longer. There was construction going on at the Planet Hollywood across the street but it really did not bother us at all. Pool: The pool was small but was never too crowded. They did also give us the option to use the pool over at the Planet Hollywood Hotel. They did not volunteer this information but we asked after we overheard someone else asking. We didn't end up checking it out but heard it was nice.Gym: Had a very nice sized gym. Each machine had a TV and it was never too crowded. All new equipment (which I guess would be expected from a new hotel!)We always stay at Marriott properties and decided to purchase the Timeshare during the presention. We probably won't use it to come back to Las Vegas too much (mostly b/c we will have a new baby) but it really was too good of a deal to pass up (for us anyway).	
Jun 27 2008 	Nice hotel but still major construction happening.	The marriott grand chateau is Las Vegas will be a very nice property once it's finished, but right now, they are still working on it, and selling it's timeshare like crazy! Everywhere you go in Vegas, they want to sell you this property. Which is how I ended up there.THe only pool there is the rooftop one, which, with temperatures soaring over 100 degrees and no shade, is not really that great!There is no restaurant, although it's about 1 block from the strip and accross the street from Planet Hollywood and the Miracle Mile Shops.Room was nice, but I found the service &quot;unpolished&quot;. Not up to par to other properties in Vegas, and if I'm going to buy into the place, I want to be treated like I belong there!But it's still a nice property and good with family, since there is no casino traffic.	
Jun 16 2008 	Nice and Clean	We stayed for four days at this hotel and loved it. We usually stay on the strip but wanted the Marriott points, paid 121.00 a night which I thought was a fair price. Good location although we did have a rent a car, the valet service was awesome, never had to wait long for our car. Our room was clean with the great Marriott bedding. The room was spacious and always nice to have the fridge. The view was fun overlooking the strip. Yes there is construction, but I never heard any noise. Pool on rooftop was small but I never had a problem finding a chair. It was fun to go up there at night to have a cocktail and enjoy the view. You can take your own drinks up there or get one from the bar. I enjoyed the piece and quiet at night and getting out of the smokey casinos. No body bugged us to buy or tour which I was afraid of.	
Jun 14 2008 	Modern and Clean	I traded my timeshare week for a stay here, and I was very happy with the property. It's new, clean, safe, and relatively quiet, located VERY close to the Strip (Planet Hollywood, Paris, Ballys, etc.). I was awakened one night by the fellow in the next room who decided to sing karoake with a bunch of girls, but other than that, I didn't hear much. I was told that construction was going on and I heard it once and saw it once, but the entire Strip is under construction right now. Be advised: there are different types of one bedrooms. Make sure you know what you're getting. My room was small with an awesome king bed, small pull-out sofa, a roomy, nice bathroom and an efficiency kitchen with a microwave, sink, small fridge, coffee maker, plates, glassware, etc. There were only two of us and we weren't in Vegas for the hotel room, but if you think four adults can stay in that size room comfortably, think again. Two adults and a child could handle it. Oh, and I never actually saw a housekeeper and didn't have housekeeping &quot;tidy up&quot; because it costs extra $. Still, if you need extra towels, shampoo, soap, all you have to do is ask. There's a downstairs Market Place store selling all types of things and yes, it's pricey, but the new Vegas isn't cheap anymore. The days of Prime Rib and Lobster for $9.99 are gone, gone, gone. There are liquor/snack stores across the street in the Miracle Mile Shops, so you can pick up things there or take the shuttle to the local grocery. The hotel staff are nice. They keep ice cold cucumber infused water in the lobby all the time. If you decide to go on a tour, SweetTours offers several. We took one to the Grand Canyon ($130 each). It took 7 hours to get out there because of the stops (Hoover Dam, Route 66, getting gas, etc.) and 5 hours to get back. We were at the canyon for almost three hours. Worth it? Yes, especially if you have the time and don't want to pay $4.33 a gallon and drive almost 600 miles in a day. Actually, the tour was a nice break from the Strip. The pool on the 38th floor was small but well maintained. One gripe: no full-length mirrors anywhere. I &quot;complained&quot; and the concierge said &quot;that's the most common complaint we get here...&quot; (uh, then buy some?). Taxis are easy to get but walk as much as you can. The Strip's traffic jams force long wait times and a trip from the hotel down to the Mirage was $12.	
Jun 14 2008 	Well located	I recently returned from a four night stay at the Marriott Grand Chateau and must say that both my travelling companions and I were all very satisfied with our stay at the hotel. The greatest asset of the property is its central location close to the strip. Although it is not directly on Las Vegas Blvd, it is a minute from the strip right next to Planet Hollywood and the Miracle Mile shops. The hotel is new and very well maintained. Although they are presently adding another wing to the hotel, we were never disturbed by the construction noise nor from the construction noise of the other properties going up around the hotel.We booked a two bedroom penthouse suite which consited of two closed bedrooms each with its own washroom, as well as a living room with a large flat screen tv and a large kitchen fully equiped (toaster, coffee machine, glasses, plates, etc) and also included granite counter tops and a washer and dryer. The hotel also provided us with soap and laundry detergent during our stay. As usual within the Marriott chain hotels, the beds were very comfortable and also had quality linens. It is also important to mention that this hotel is a timeshare hotel so if you wish to have someone come clean your room daily, it is for an extra fee.The hotel also has a rooftop pool and bar. The views are wonderful at night. The area is kept very clean and has lounge chairs for sunbathing. Although the pool is quite small, especially when you see the pool areas of the much larger gaming hotels on the strip, it still provides a nice refreshment from the dry heat. There is a convenience store in the lobby which sells coffee, toast, sodas, juices, etc which you can purchase and prepare breakfast in your room. However, located right across the street within the Miracle Mile shops are various restaurants offering breakfast for under $5.00. There is also a Walgreens close to the hotel where you can pick up other items such as water, chips, chocolate, etc for less than the convenience store directly in the hotel.I would strongly recommend the Marriott Grand Chateau to anyone looking for a very clean, quite, safe and well located hotel close to the strip. However, if you are seeking the lights, commotion and casino ambience of the more traditional Las Vegas hotels, then it would be better to reserve at another hotel located directly on Las Vegas Blvd such as the Bellagio, MGM or Treasure Island which offer various dining options, shops, shows and casinos under the same roof.	
Jun 3 2008 	Ok Stay but double charged	Made a reservation over six months ago. About two months later I had to change the dates and was told there would be no problem. During one of the Eleven, yes Eleven phone calls from the time share sales person (it got really annoying) I found out they had two reservations for me. The reservationist did not change the first reservation she made another one. So I had two reservations over lapping. When I called the hotel directly to let them know there was a problem the girl on the phone kept saying &quot;we require a 7 day cancellation&quot;. I explained the situation three times and each time she said the same thing. Why would I need to reservations that over lap two days?Hotel is fine style and amenities wise but it is basically the cookie cutter marriott timeshare product. Nothing overly special.	
May 30 2008 	Great Suite great place nice people.	We stayed here as a promotional gift to attend a Timeshare Presentation. Usually, if you're here for this reason, be prepared to not get a suite, you will likely have an intermediate room (aka &quot;Lock Off&quot; room) which is the second bedroom part of a 2 bedroom suite. As luck would have it, we happened to get the other side, a full 1 bedroom suite.The 1 bedroom suites are very nice. Not that I stay in a lot of luxury places, but I was very impressed. The room was comfortable in all ways. Being not attached to a casino, they're not trying to get you out of the room, so they have nice freebies not un-common in most cities, but not usually seen in Vegas hotels, such as free premium channels (such as HBO) and free WiFi. The Big Plasma screen was nice (the channel guide didn't work though) as well as the mini-stereo. The double shower was nice as well as the big soaking tub (was odd draining though, which could be the plumbing issues other people have mentioned.) The place was quiet, we didn't hear any construction or plumbing noise, but the AC was a bit noisy, no less than the AC units in other &quot;mainstream&quot; hotels though. As much as it was nice to have the kitchen, and as much as we planned on using it, we just didn't, but it was nice to have the option. We did use the fridge, it worked (shrug.) The pillows on the bed were a bit flat, but the front desk sent up a replacement (although we found out there were more in the closet for the pull out bed.) It was also nice to have the extra blankets in the closet since the comforter on the bed was thick and hot, the thinner blanket was perfect.We were on the 7th floor, facing the strip. No view to speak of, we could see the MGM sign, the Polo Club, construction, and part of the Belagio sign. At night though the construction view wasn't as bad, just twinkling lights and purple neon from the Polo Club. Short elevator ride though. From the roof pool though, that was a nice view. The weather was not so great (may 21st to 24th) when we were there, so the pool was closed the first day due to wind, which is probably the main down-side to a roof pool, but other things were closed in the area as well (Belagio fountains, Sirens of TI.)The lobby and exterior were nice; the mini-store was handy, although a bit expensive, but you pay for convenience. Von's (general supermarket) wasn't that far away if you have a car, we passed by it on the way to the Pinball Museum on Tropicana. There is no self parking, the Valet is the only thing to park on site, but they are fast and plenty courteous (they lost someone's keys while we were there, but took care of them well by paying for the locksmith and taxi's while they searched the area and videos to find the keys.)If you're going for a Timeshare presentation, be prepared for the presentation. I've been to a few and this one is on the nice side, but it's still sales. Plan on at least 2 hours, closer to 2.5 when you include waiting for them. The sales person we had was very personable and easy to talk to; they'll show you lots of options. (We didn't buy, but it looks like a decent deal, choose for yourself.)Checkout is a bit early for us at 10AM (well, early when you're in Vegas) but you may be able to get a late checkout, call early to find out or check the night before, they didn't have any available at 8:3AM when we called.This is a great location, fine with a car or not. We didn't have our car the first day, PH was right next door, simply across the street. It'll be even nicer when the City Center is done and when the other 2 towers are finished (another pool, larger, on top of the garage is planned.)	
May 30 2008 	Wonderful place	I had a hard time booking hotels in Las Vegas over the Memorial weekend, so I stayed here one night, and had to move to another hotel for the second night. The hotel staff was friendly, valet parking and wifi internet were free. We reserved a two-bedroom unit and had a lot of space. The view from my bedroom was stunningly great! The bed was super comfortable. Our bathroom has a tub plus a shower stall with two shower heads. Very enjoyable! . The first night, the water temperature was not hot enough. We called for service, and they arrived within minutes and fixed the problem. Great response. The livinng room, dining room and kitchen was in a huge common area. Nice furnitures. They have good size fridge, dishwasher, microwave, stove and cooktop, and all the utentials for 8 people. They even have a pair of very nice washing and drying machines. There are some minor issues so you are aware of. (a) There is no casino or restauant in the hotel. (b) It is a walk of about a block to the main strip. (c) the pool on the roof is relatively small. (d) since it is kind of like an upscale apartment unit, there is minimum bath amenities, just soap. Other than that, it is a super great place to stay for holidays!	
May 24 2008 	Great place to stay	We were travelling as a family group of 5 and had trouble finding accommodation to suit a groups needs. I booked this apartment style hotel after researching on the Net and we were all very pleased with this choice. The Hotel was not part of a casino but was very conveniently situated very centrally next to the busy Strip, and we enjoyed the peacefulness this hotel offered. The minute you enter this hotel you see its style and the rooms are equally superb. We had booked a 3 bedroom apartment and it was excellent value for money and much more than we expected.	
May 15 2008 	Worked GREAT for this guy!	Stayed at the Grand Chateau May 5 - May 9 in a King room on the 27th floor facing the Polo Towers and Strip, booked through the Marriott website.Location is very nice, just a very short walk up Harmon to S Las Vegas Blvd. And across Harmon is Planet Hollywood, which will pretty much be your &quot;home casino&quot; while staying at the Grand Chateau.For those who are up for walking, you can easily walk to MGM Grand, Monte Carlo, New York-New York, Excalibur, Tropicana, Paris, Bally's, and Bellagio. And once MGM City Center is finished, that'll be right there too!Valet parking was complimentary, but you couldn't tell that by the effort put forth by the crew, as they were on top of everything. Good attitudes, good hustle, good service.No problems at check-in, a few minutes and I was headed to my room.Good bank of elevators, 6 total I believe. Never had to wait more than 30 seconds going up or down.Rooms are nice, with a nice layout and a decent &quot;kitchenette&quot; setup including a fridge, microwave, toaster, sink, plates, utensils, etc. Most important for me were the wine glasses and corkscrew.The dresser/armoire setup was good, the sleeper sofa decent, and the bed.. I love Marriott's beds at this hotel level. So comfy.Bathroom is spacious, with a nice counter top surrounding the sink so there's ample room for stuff. The shower isn't fancy, but does the job. Most importantly, shower head was tall enough for me at 6'2&quot;. And yes, the water got to SCALDING hot very easily, so watch out! But I'll take that over NO hot water any day!The construction at the PH and City Center sites was not enough to wake me up in the morning, and I didn't notice it much at all while in the room at different times of the day. For anyone wanting to be near the strip but not wanting to deal with the craziness that goes with casino hotels, this place is GREAT!	
May 6 2008 	Wonderful!	We Stayed on the 28th floor the first weekend of May. It was a wonderful experience. Our room was neat and clean, and exactly how the pictures show it. We had a one bedroom suite and had 4 people staying in it, and there was plenty of room. Our view was of the airport not the strip, but we can't complain. There was a little construction noise in the middle of the day, but it wasn't bothersome. Planet Hollywood is right next door and that is where we ended up spending most of our time since it has shows, shops, food, and casinos. I know the grande chateau is a timeshare property but I would have liked there to be some sort of restaurant in the building. All it has is a convenient type store in the lobby. $6 for a little salad. So we didnt really get much from there. The pool on the roof was nice. Small, but adequate. Got quite busy on really sunny days. The concierge was very helpful helping me and my sister-in-law book a spa treatment elsewhere. All in all, great quiet place a block from the strip!	
Apr 19 2008	Warning - All 1 bedroom are not the same	We're Marriott owners in the first 24 hours of our stay, and so far are extremely disappointed. The Chateau knows they have a problem with Interval and has done nothing to remedy it. We came expecting a one bedroom as described on their website and in the reviews above. Turns out there are two classes of one bedrooms. If you get stuck with a one bedroom which is the lockoff portion of a three bedroom suite you end up with a room half the size of the normal rooms, a bathroom with one single vanity and one mirror. This room is supposed to accommodate up to four people and every other Marriott one bedroom we've stayed in does - they may be tight but they are workable. At the Chateau its tough to have two people in this room. There isn't even a second mirror in the whole place. The area only accommodates a two person dining table but they squeezed in four chairs. We had to stack up two of the dining room chairs in a corner as they blocked the entrance door and the kitchen area. The Chateau itself does not call this a one-bedoom, but they allow Interval to keep booking this as a one-bedroom. If you know what a junior suite is at a Residence Inn, that is what it is. We are here for a week and supposedly they are working with Interval to try and get us moved. Lots of talk from them about how Marriott can't do anything; however, Marriott owners are supposed to have priority. I'll post again in a couple of days and let you know if Marriott comes through and remedies the situation.	
Apr 7 2008 	Nice property	We stayed here March 28 to April 4, 2008 in a one bedroom accommodation. The unit was lovely and very clean. I really appreciated the separate vanities as hubby had his and I had mine. It made it easier when getting ready for the day. As we like to have a light breakfast in the room, the kitchen was a plus. The king bed was very comfortable with a nice duvet. We used the exercize room which was great and no extra charge. The location is great, just off strip. They have a shuttle that runs from noon until 6:30PM to the Fashion Mall. We used it several times when we went to the Wynn, Venetian and others at that end of the strip. Our room faced the PH construction so at times we did hear the noise. Also we did hear noise from above when a shower was used or tub filled. If a pool is important to you, this is not the place to stay. The pool is very small. I think it is the smallest pool, i have ever seen. It was not important to us as we have a pool at our Florida home, but I know for some people who visit Vegas from the Northern climates a pool is important. Also the MGC is non smoking. They do have an area by the roof bar where one can smoke and by the front door. In their printed information book, they state very clearly that if you smoke in the room, they will charge you $250.00 cleaning fee. The small market off of reception is very pricy. We enjoyed our stay, overall and would not hesitate to stay again.	
Mar 29 2008	Loved the Grand Chateau	Stayed at the Marriott Grand Chateau for a couple nights. Overall an excellent facility with a great location as described in several other recent reviews. We stayed in a 1 bedroom timeshare unit and the unit is accurately depicted in the hotel photos. The experience is what you would typically expect from a Marriott timeshare.Note that construction is an issue, but not that bad. There is construction on the new tower for the Grand Chateau as well as across the street at Planet Hollywood. It does get a bit noisy in the morning when they start work at 5:30am.The rooftop pool is small, but nice. The pool bar has happy hour prices for a couple hours on weekdays. The Grand Chateau also offers free wireless internet service.	
Mar 28 2008 	Great Alternative to Traditional Hotel	I was able to stay here as part of my timeshare exchange. It is a lovely location and the roof top pool and view is awesome. It seems a bit small, but every time I was up there I always found a seat. Maybe if they build the other 2 towers and don't add another pool there will be a problem. Everything is new and beds are super comfortable. Gym was nice and included too (I hate paying extra to workout). Certainly a place I would recommend and stay at again if I ever return to Vegas.	
Mar 25 2008	Grand Suites!! Great location off strip close to everything!!	This hotel is a timeshare property and is simply fabulous!!! The suites come with fully equipped kitchens with washer and dryers. There is an awesome flat screen TV in the main family room and a separate TV in the bedroom. There was also a jacuzzi tub in the master bedroom. The bathroom was simply gorgeous with a marble shower with 3 shower heads. This changed our entire LV experience and I cant wait to go back.	
Mar 14 2008 	Great Location Great Room Great Stay	- Location  Having been to Vegas several times before, location is indeed everything since everything else is so far away! MGC has a great location right next to Planet Hollywood (going by the lower case ph) which is almost done with the redecorating from the old Aladdin although the mall part still needs much work. There was no trouble getting a cab (my preferred means of transit) which was a big plus over other non-casino lodging. I could also walk to MGM but it was quite a walk and past some of the cheap trinket shops and a 24 hr Walgreens (also nice to have close by). - Room  First let me say that while I knew in advance that this was a timeshare/suite hotel, that did not prepare me for the size of the room. It was quite spacious! Fully stocked kitchen (I dont cook in Vegas when Chef Puck has so many choices for me!) along with a washer/dryer unit in the closet. King bed was very comfy. Double shower heads were fantastic and water pressure was good. Soaking tub was a great option on the last night when I wanted to wash all the Vegas dust off and prepare to return to the real world. There was some plumbing noise and the AC unit was louder than most. The outside of the windows were really dirty because of the construction outside. The windows blocked most of the construction noise from the ph tower that was being erected not 250 feet from my room! - Service  I only had my room cleaned once while I was there. Standard care, nothing extraordinary. The valets and bellmen were all really friendly and appreciated being tipped (who doesnt) but werent as pushy as some can be in sin city! - timeshare  I thought I was going to be overwhelmed with pushy sales people trying to get me to take the tour and experience the difference of ownership but that just didnt happen. I was offered to come to one meeting and that was it. The staff never asked me again and I was treated no differently than anyone else in the place. Although there was an owners lounge which I did not try to usethey need their perks! - The Roof  This is only place I have stayed in Vegas to date that offered guests access to the roof. I enjoyed this and would consider it a true plus to staying here. There is something about getting a panoramic view of the strip that gives it a whole different appearance (see photos).	
Mar 12 2008 	Great change from typical hotels	I stayed here for 3 nights during a major convention and booked the room mainly because I wanted something that was convenient and reasonably priced. Since the property is under construction, the rates were very attractive ($250 for a trade show is good in Vegas) and I essentially got a 1 BR suite that I would give 4 Stars. It is not a casino hotel and has no restaurants on site, so you have to go elsewhere for that, but it's definitely a nice place to stay. Free internet is a plus- seems like everywhere else will charge you $10-20 per day for a connection. Turndown service costs extra, but can make my own bed just like at home. Overall, the construction is unobtrusive if you get a high floor room. Pool and bar on the rooftop are nice and intimate.Stay here if you want a &quot;quieter&quot; atmosphere for sleeping, as opposed to bringing the party back to the room (or staying among those who do) in casino hotels.	
Feb 24 2008	Nice and clean / brand new. No amenities.	Stayed here for a few days during Feb 08 for a business conference. Definitely not a bad place to stay for a business event, if you want to have a nice clean room that has plenty of taxicabs out front and you can be to a conference in a few minutes.The hotel room was nice - great layout for a hotel room with a king bed, pullout sofa, nice decor and great bath. Of course, it's brand new, so that's sort of what I expected, but it did meet expectations.One thing to be alerted to: there are no restaurants on site. They have built only 1 of 3 towers to be located on this site, and presumably there will be a full complement of restaurant choices when complete, but not now. Only a 24 hr convenience shop with outrageous prices, even for Vegas (can you say $80 for a generic sweatshirt and a marriott logo, or $3 for a coke?). So if you have plans to get work done in the hotel itself, don't count on ordering room service. Nor is there any place in the lobby to pop open a laptop for an hour - just FYI.Same goes for families with small kids- there is nothing really for them to do IN the hotel (there is some kids program but it looked sort of weak to me - I did not have my kids with me to try it out though). Can't have them walk around the lobby with you for 1/2 hour looking at shops or toys etc - there's just nothing there that would be of any interest to them.Otherwise, the service was fantastic, the location right off the strip and next to the shopping mall was very convenient, and you're getting a good night's rest for a good price.	
Feb 20 2008 	Great Room - Noisy nights	Hubby and I stayed for Christmas Week. Great location, new, well stocked. Only real problem was at 2:30 in the morning the room above us would fill the tub and we would be abruptly awakened by the water noises. Staff was great, room was clean. Would stay again but request a really high floor and hope no one is above me.	
Feb 20 2008	Loved the Chateau	We only had one night at the Chateau after having stayed at the Wynn. We were very happy with the facilities and the location, one block off the strip and right next to great shopping at the Miracle Mile shops at Planet Hollywood. The rooftop pool had great views- also free water with sliced citrus fruit in the lobby was very welcoming sight after walking the hot dusty strip. We loved the atmosphere at the hotel, we just regret not having more time to enjoy it.	
Feb 14 2008 	Pleasant week in Las Vegas	This was our first stay at the Marriott Grand Chateau. We came to Vegas to visit family and friends. It has been easy to access the property and get across town with our rental car by using Koval and Hacienda instead of Las Vegas Blvd. The free valet parking works very well. A couple of dollar tip every time you pick up your car is well worth it to have your car parked in the Grand Chateau parking garage. Front desk people are responsive and accomodating. We needed two extra place settings for a meal we were serving and all arrived within 15 minutes after the request. The elevators are very prompt. The room was without fault. We had a room on the 30th floor on the Harmon St side. The noise we heard was NOT from the Marriott construction, but from other new construction. It was not offensive but be aware that construction noise is a way of life on the strip. At times even during the night. All in all, the Grand Chateau meets and/or exceeds the Marriott Customer Service expectations expected.	
Feb 11 2008 	Excellent timeshare and rental in Las Vegas	Marriott property booked through Interval International timeshare. Construction will continue for several years according to info. provided by our time share company. Two bedroom unit not available when we wanted to travel. This review is for the One bedroom unit we booked with king size bed and sleeper sofa in living room. One bath. Furniture and bedding very good quality- comfortable except for pillows, which are standard hotel issue. We are in our early sixties and the bed provided excellent support for our arthritic backs. If you can't live without your own pillow and don't want to carry it or ship it from home, there are Brookstone and Sharper Image stores that will be glad to sell you a Tempurpedic or similar type pillow which you can ship home when you leave! Bathroom was a good size with two entry doors(one from master bedroom and one from living room if you have someone sleeping on the sleeper sofa) and had large walk-in shower with two shower heads. Jacuzzi type tub in master bedroom. Second sink and vanity area in area across from Jacuzzi with mirror/vanity and seat. Hair dryer provided. Kitchen has full size refrigerator/freezer and cooktop range, microwave,toaster,coffeemaker, blender and dinnerware.Small dishwasher. Glass round table in dining alcove seats 6. Sundry store off lobby has beverages and food items. Walgreens and CVS are about a ten minute walk.Resort has a shuttle to a Von's grocery store a few days a week (make reservations). Miracle Mile shopping mall across the street with many stores and restaurants attached to Planet Hollywood resort. Construction noise was mentioned in many of the reviews we read but we did not hear much noise in our room, which faced Las Vegas Blvd. on 21st floor. We walked to many resorts or took a cab. Bellagio, MGM, Paris,New York,NY easy walk from building. We saw several shows: &quot;O&quot; was our favorite along with another Cirque du Soliel production called &quot;Ka&quot; and a traditional Las Vegas show girl production called &quot;Jubilee&quot;. Also enjoyed walking around in Venetian, but take a cab and save your feet. Bring some Dr. Scholl's moleskin or foot padding if you are prone to blisters.There is a monorail that has stops at several hotels (MGM is closest to Marriott Grand Chateau) Monorail fare higher than cab for 2 people if you visit several properties in a day (about $5.00 per person or a bit cheaper for a 3-day pass). The cab takes you where you want to go without walking from monorail stop. A double-decker bus called &quot;the Deuce&quot; is cheaper than either monorail or cab if you don't mind the wait. No casino or restaurant in Grand Chateau, but the strip is only a block away. The kitchen comes in handy for days when your feet hurt too much to hike any further. There is a nice bar on the top floor with great view and also a health club in the building. Concierge was friendly. Only two complaints: the very loud forced air heating/cooling unit which rattles and cannot be silenced unless it is turned off (maintenance adjusted the unit but apparently this is a building-wide problem that persists). Windows do not open but if you slide the vent at the bottom of the windows, some fresh air can be felt coming in. I would not want to stay in this hotel in the extreme heat of a Las Vegas summer unless I wore ear plugs to cover the noise of the air conditioner to sleep or used an I-POD with good noise attenuating head set. If you don't mind loud air handlers or forced air units, this might not be a problem for you. The washer/dryer combo is stacked in a very small closet and both are extremely limited in size. Two shirts and some socks washed in one load but the dryer left the clothing only damp after 2 hours (very loud, also). We hung our clothes around the unit to dry over night. Laundry valet service is available. No daily maid service, which is typical in most timeshares, but you can get fresh towels daily. Don't even think about washing your own towels in the washer/dryer. Very small safe inside bedroom closet (will hold small laptop computer standing vertically). Combination lock. Wireless internet service available and business center also has computers. Entire building is non-smoking, which was great. Staff very helpful. Would stay again in winter season or early spring. Flat screen TV in living and bedroom. DVD player in living room. Since flat screen TV in living rooms of most newer hotels hang on walls, we have found that we can hear TV from next unit through wall; however, the bedroom was quiet. There is so much construction going on in Las Vegas that it will be years before it is all completed. Still-this is a town to enjoy the many things to do, good food, shows and variety of shopping. It is never boring. We slept well and the Las Vegas winters are a break from the snow and cold of the northeast U.S. The airport is a short ride from the strip and &quot;people watching&quot; is a blast here. The photos provided on most travel sites and by the Marriott are accurate.	
Feb 3 2008 	Would definitely go back	My parents own a Marriott timeshare in another location, which I exchanged for the Grand Chateau. Usually my husband and I stay at the Bellagio, and I was expecting a downgrade. However, I was very pleasantly surprised. The rooms (1 bedroom, living room with sofabed, full kitchen) were immaculate. The kitchen was very well stocked in terms of appliances, paper towels, soap, etc. The two-headed shower was a great touch, as was the tub in the bedroom big enough for two. The flat-panel TVs were also a plus. The location was great; less than five minutes to get to Planet Hollywood, about ten minutes to the Bellagio. The only downsides are that 1) the convenience store is WAY overpriced; and 2) they charge exorbitant fees for maid service, so we passed. Note: We managed to dodge the timeshare presentation, but be warned; Marriott timeshare folks are right there with the rest of them in the malls (although they're less pushy than the average timeshare folk!). All in all, a very nice experience (especially since it was free), and not too much of a step down from the Bellagio.	
Feb 2 2008 	Las Vegas View	We just returned from a week at our timeshare at the Marriott Grand Chateau in Las Vegas. January was a little too cold for us but we managed to use the wonderful hot tub on the top floor of the hotel every day. The view is magnificent and so worth a trip up to see. There is also a heated pool and a bar up there as well. There is a Market Place for necessary items such as milk, bread, cereal, sodas, snacks. There is also hot coffee and a beverage fountain in the Market Place. There is an owner's lounge that came in handy when we had to check out and our flight did not leave for a couple of hours. There are couches and a nice TV as well as computers you can use for $ .35 per minute. The staff is very helpful and courteous. We stayed in our lock off room which had refrig,coffee,toaster,microwave, dishes and silverware. The only downfall or may be a good thing is that there is no casino in the hotel, however you have Planet Hollywood and MGM right next door within walking distance. The other casino's depending on the weather are also within walking distance. We would definitely recommend this hotel especially if you are staying for a week or longer.	
Jan 21 2008 	Under Development but a Great Place to Stay	My wife and I spent a week at the Marriott Grand Chateau in mid January 2008. Although we enjoy Las Vegas, we do not smoke or gamble, and therefore, this was a great place for us. This is a time share property, not a hotel, so you can expect what a time share, particularly a Marriott time share offers, i.e., a non-smoking facility, no casino, a family friendly environment (e.g., iced water with lemon or orange always available in the lobby, cookies in the afternoon, MAZE kids club on site, etc.). The rooms are large and well appointed; we enjoyed watching the sunsets from our room as the lights came up on the city. Also, the living room featured a 42&quot; LCD television with 95 channels and a DVD player. The place is new and in some areas still under construction, so it looks great, and it is very clean and nice. But don't expect daily maid service unless you want to pay extra, and don't expect many of the usual hotel features, like a spa or restaurants, as neither are on site. But, you do get complimentary valet parking that is fast, friendly and efficient, and the location, 1 block off the Strip across the street from Planet Hollywood, and 2 blocks from the Bellagio, is great. There is a workout facility on site, a roof-top pool and hot tub (we did not use them as it was cold and windy while we were there, but the view from the roof, 37 stories above the desert, is not to be missed), and a roof top bar that is open during the warm months. And, with a friendly and efficient staff that takes care of your needs consistent with the location (i.e., concierge service is available on site, but room service is not), this is a great place to stay in Vegas.	
Jan 16 2008 	Excellent Stay - I will return!	First off, the Hotel is brand new and located about 200 yards from the Strip (Las Vegas Boulevard). I have stayed at many great hotels in Las Vegas before and this place was great. The service was top notch with friendly personnel at the front desk/valet/belldesk, etc... The Lobby is very clean and smoke free with NO casino! This was a bonus since you do need some down time from all the noise and excitement of the Strip. Valet parking is also free.The room was huge. I had a Villa Suite. It was perfect and very clean. Plasma TV on the wall in the family room, a large kitchen with all the cabinets stocked, a full size fridge, oven, stove, microwave, double headed shower, and a sink and massive bathtub in the bed area. I had a guest that slept on the sofa which converted into a bed. He said it was one of the best nights sleep he had ever had. He could not believe that a sofa bed could be so comfortable, and I tried it and it was quite nice. The King size bed in the main room was also very comfortable and also included its own TV. Both rooms also had DVD players and you can rent movies down in the Lobby. They did a great job cleaning the rooms and even made up the sofa bed after the first night of using it.My favorite thing to do at Hotels is to use the fitness center and pool area. Let me tell you about the fitness center. It had all the equipment you could ever need and it was very clean. Plenty of TVs to watch on the treadmills and other equipment. The best part was the Locker room which included a huge steam room. I have never been in a steam room that was as efficient as this one. You could hardly see your hand if front of your face. It was magnificient!To top it off (no pun intended) , the Hotel decided to put a Pool, Hot Tub and Bar on the top of the Hotel. It was January, so I did not see anyone using the Heated Pool or Hottub. Well, I had a few friends join me at the pool. We enjoyed the Hot Tub for about an hour. It was so nice. Not one person bothered us because they were not there (and the hotel was completely booked!). The view was amazing. You could see the whole Strip from end to end. There were heating lamps out on a patio in front of the bar to keep you warm and smoking was allowed in a small area. The bar was closed because it was winter, but in the summer time it will be perfect.I really enjoyed myself at this hotel and I plan on staying here every year when I return for the Consumer Electronics Show in January.Regarding the construction going on at nearby properties and at the Marriott property, I did not hear a single thing realted to construction. In fact I could not hear anything outside at all. The room is sealed very well. Keep in mind my room was facing the strip. If you face the opposite direction (towards the airport) you may hear something but I can not attest to that. I only have one complaint and this is because I am a technology enthusiast. They have beautiful HD Sony Plasma TV's in every room, however they are only delivering analog programming to every room. This blows me away. What a waste of a TV. There is no reason to have these TV's if they are not going to deliver High Definition content. In fact, this is not dificult to do either and would cost the hotel $0 since all the local TV stations broadcast Over the Air (received with an antenna) in High Definition and is FREE. If anyone from the hotel reads this review, please make an upgrade to the TV service.IOther than my one issue with the TVs I HIGHLY recommend staying here. You will be treated nicely and will enjoy your stay.	
Jan 15 2008 	Awesome first time in Vegas	It was my first time to Vegas and my husband's first time back in 20 years. My first glimpse of The Strip was overwhelming. Huge hotels and billions of $$ represented. We arrived on the Saturday after Thanksgiving and only had to go 3/4 mile down the strip to turn onto Harmon Street to reach the Marriott's Grand Chateau. It took us almost an hour! The foot traffic and auto traffic was unbelievable. It took us 20 minutes just to go 7 car spaces to turn onto Harmon Street. We then decided that we would avoid driving on the Strip when we went out driving. We soon learnt the back roads that run parellel with the Strip. We arrived at the Grand Chateau and first impressions were awesome! They had valet and bell hops there to assist with your luggage. Valet was complimentary - great bonus! Check in was a breeze and then it was up to our suite. We were on the 31st floor and the elevator ride was very quick and ear popping! Our suite was beautiful. We had an awesome view of the mountains in the distance. We did overlook the construction going on across the road at Planet Hollywood but it did not obstruct our view of the mountains. We also had a slight view of one part of the strip too. So plenty to see out the window.After unpacking we then went down to the lobby to see if we could get show tickets. We went to the conceirge and she was fabulous. One show I have been wanting to see was Danny Gans. When we tried to get tickets before our trip we couldn't as it was sold out. But our conceirge got us on the aisle seats for Wednesday evening. Unfortunately she couldn't get us Celine Dion tickets as well but that's the way some of the shows go. We were also able to get tickets to Mamma Mia! for Thursday night. Both shows were excellent and we had excellent seats for the shows. Our suite was very well appointed with a full kitchen, dining area, living room, bedroom, huge two person soaking tub, seperate shower and washer and dryer. Everything was beautifully doecorated. In fact out of all the MVCI's I have stayed at this was the nicest. My only complaint about the suite was the washer and dryer were very small so you couldn't wash much. One load was two of my shirts and two of my husbands. We tried drying them in the dryer but after three hours we gave up and hung them up on hangers to dry.One thing I did like is that they offered a free shuttle service once a day to the local supermarket so you could buy items to prepare in your suite. That is much better than buying food from the Marketplace in the lobby. The prices in the marketplace were a bit on the high side.We went up to the roof top bar/pool area to get some great shots of the full moon rising above the mountains. The area was very small. The pool area was tiny. For families there is not much around the pool area for the kids to do. The pool is about 3-4ft deep and about 20 feet long. They had a spa pool there too which holds about 4-6 adults The bar area was outdoors and the only area in the entire hotel where you can smoke. Being a non-smoker I love the fact that Marriott has 100% smoke-free in all their hotel rooms. But trying to enjoy the fabulous view from the roof top with smokers around was difficult. It will be interesting to see if they do anything else with the rooftop area once the other three towers are fully completed.One thing I will say though, we were there for a week and not once were we disturbed by the construction in the second tower. There was the inconvenience of having to open fire doors while they did silent alarm tests, but that was only minor. As far as construction goes our complaint was with Planet Hollywood who seemed to be working 24/7 on their site across the road. The only time we were disturbed by the their construction was when they were pumping concrete from the ground floor to the 18th floor at 3am! Those pumps were very loud!Over all we had a fabulous stay at the MVCI Grand Chateau and would not hesitate to get back there again. You are only 1/2 block from the stirp, which made it convenient to get to the strip. The MVCI doesn't have any restaurants but they are within walking distance of several eating places. We either brought stuff to prepare at the local supermarket or we would eat whereever we were.Overall my first experience in Vegas was great. I would love to go back again and explore some more. If I can stay at the MVCI Grand Chateau again I would not complain! I have no idea what they charge for a room rate at the Grand Chateau. We traded a week at another MVCI for a week at the Grand Chateau. I know you can rent the rooms but I don't know what they would go for.	
Jan 4 2008	Clean Beautiful Well Built Quiet	Great Hotel... Well actually it's more like a residence. My boyfriend and I get a week time share from his parents so I think most of the rooms here are time shares though they do rent it out as a regular hotel. We absolutely loved our room - a one bedroom suite, kitchen, dining table, two flat screens, hot tub and double shower. Literally after the first night in Vegas we didn't leave the room! Service is extremely friendly. I left my cell phone in my car and they went and got it and brought in up to me right away. There is no room service or daily maid service so that's the only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars. But I guess that's normal for time shares. Of course you can always get fresh towels or sheets anytime. And the concierge is more than happy to reccommend some restaurants that deliver. Anyway, the location is extremely convenient right off the strip. They have a free shuttle that goes to the Fashion Mall. There is a little gift shop that has all kinds of food to make in your room. I really liked staying in a place without a casino and all that mayem. It was nice to retreat back here after a late night of clubs and gambling. There is also a complimentary gym (somehow the elevator has been skipping that floor haha :) Also a pool and bar on the roof which I haven't seen cause it's cold this time of year. All in all I would definitely reccomment this place.	
Jan 3 2008 	Thumbs Up!	We exchanged our Marriott Timeshare for a week in Vegas over Christmas. The property is an oasis of calm on the Strip (well, just off the strip but closer than parts of the big hotels because they are so ...well....big). First off, construction noise. They have yet to build two more towers on this property so noise will be an on-going issue, but when we were there they were doing internal work on an existing tower so we heard no noise from our property. However the whole of Vegas is a construction zone and there was early morning noise (5am onwards) from a huge site across the Strip. Guests at areas of Bellagio, Polo Towers, ph , and Monte Carlo would have been more affected than us however.Grand Chateau is very nicely decorated and the suites are spacious. The pool is tiny but it was too cold to swim anyway!There is no restaurant on site but many within easy walking distance. We walked nearly everywhere because the traffic on the Strip made walking just about quicker than a cab! GC has a shuttle bus to and from the Fashion Show Mall several times a day and to a local supermarket once a day friday-tues I think (ie. the mornings after check-in days). We tried the Deuce bus once when we wanted to go downtown. Maybe we were unlucky but we found that we had to wait 20 minutes for a very crowded bus, and we got a cab back( after a lovely meal at Hugo's)! Also had a wonderful (traditional) Christmas lunch at The Verandah restaurant at the Four Seasons. Best turkey I've had (but don't tell my mother). As for shows, we loved Ka and Spamalot, and found Mac King (free if we bought a $9 drink, no-brainer!) side-achingly funny! We got most of our tickets through Tix4tonite(5 mins from GC) Best tip though: Before you go print out a VIP line voucher from the Tix4Tonite website and this will save you maybe a half hour or more in line. I printed out a few but they let us use the same one for a few days!	
Dec 24 2007	Great Resort	Just wanted to let anyone who is interested that the Marriott Grand Chateau was great. We arrived late on December 16th and the front desk staff was very helpful. Check in was quick and painless. We had been given a week of timeshare by a friend for our anniversary. The one bedroom villa was very nice. It was located in a good area with everything within a 10 min. drive. Yes, the maid service is extra but we made out fine with just getting towels and clean sheets with no problem. I know when you are on vacation you feel you should not have to clean up but I enjoyed my privacy. We did not have to worry about having someone come in our room everyday and distrub us if we just wanted to stay in. I love the Grand Chateau and would recommend it to anyone who inquired. Oh, and even though we did not have to do the timeshare presentation when they ask we decided to see what it was about. They were not pushy after we told them we did not think it was for us. Hope this helps anyone interested in staying at this resort.	
Dec 19 2007 	Wonderful room great location!	I exchanged my timeshare week for a week at the Marriott Grand Chateau and what a wonderful experience it was! The staff were very friendly, professional and helpful. Although my daughters and I pulled up with our jeep full of bags, coolers and personal items, the complimentary valet parking and bell hops took care of everything. I'm sure I looked a mess when we arrived after the 4 hour drive, but everyone made us feel very welcome. The hotel itself is only a 1/2 block off of the strip and within walking distance to many of the casinos. Our room was beautifully furnished and very comfortable. We had the one bedroom suite, and the four of us were very comfortable. I would definitely stay here again!	
Dec 7 2007 	Excellent stay	Stayed a week at the Grand Chateau as a Marriott Vacation Club Owner, with my wife and 3 kids. This is actually my first stay as an owner, so I have nothing to compare it to, but this resort made me and my family feel like the royalty. Check in was a breeze and the bellman did a wonderful job fitting all of our stuff on the bellcart as you can imagine a family of 5 checking in for a week has a ton of luggage. Our room was fabulous with a 2 bedroom lockoff option. Washing machine, dishwasher, plasma screen tv, dvd player, 2 big King beds, 2 couch pullout beds and plenty of room for all of us, as my mom, sister and neice joined in on the fun. I can't stress enough reading prior reviews, that this IS NOT your typical hotel. It is a timeshare and meant to be used in 3-4 or 7 day increments. There is no daily maid service unless you want to pay for it, however, they will bring up fresh towels if you call and request them. If you are not a timeshare owner and you book this on the internet, prepare to be bombarded with the Marriott spiel trying to get you to buy a piece of ownership. Also, they might say that the presentation will last 90 minutes, but count on about 2-3 hours and if you decide to buy, 4-5 hours. Anyway, back to our vacation. Our week was great, we went to Shark Reef at Mandalay Bay, Adventuredome at Circus Circus, Fantasy Faire at Excalibur and Doggone Silly which is a dog show at the Krave in Planet Hollywood. Although Las Vegas is trying to break the family theme, there is still stuff for kids to do. However, I do prefer to be with adults here, haha.. Hope this helps and if you stay here, enjoy.	
Dec 6 2007	Good Stay for the location	I was very worried about staying here after reading the reviews, but I was plesently surprised. The hotel is very clean and new. They are still working out a few kinks, including the air ducts in the bedroom (they sound like a train coming through the ducts when they turn on). You can keep the heat/air down and minimize how much you hear. This was the worst thing and not even bad.The time share thing is a joke. It could be for someone else, but we are trying to buy a house before we buy a vacation home. It you must go for your stay just act really uninterested and they will leave you alone.Over all is was a good stay. The location was perfect. Very clean and the service was good.	
Dec 5 2007	Construction Update - no worries	Just returned from a one week stay in a one bedroom suite at the Grand Chateau. I was a bit worried after reading all those reviews about construction noise, but my fears proved groundless. For at least the next few months they will be working on the interior finishings of the second tower suites (17th floor and up). I stayed in the second tower on the 9th floor and never heard a thing. In fact, I might have been the first person to stay in my suite, as it was spotless and nothing looked used. I thoroughly enjoyed the room and the hotel.Others have written in depth about this hotel so I won't go into too much more detail. The location is great, just across the street from a major shopping mall which has several good restaurants and leads directly to the Planet Hollywood casino. Bellagio is only a 15 minute walk as is Paris, MGM Grand, and New York New York and others.The Marriott is non-smoking which is great especially after hanging around all those smoky casinos. Yes, the pool on the roof is extremely small - they will build a bigger one off the lobby next year.The Owner's Lounge is very handy as there are two internet stations for 35 cents a minute, plus a very relaxing massage chair and TV.Can't think of anything bad about this hotel and will definitely return. The location and amenities are perfect.	
Nov 25 2007 	Great Stay!	Great place to stay - it's away from the strip and is completely non smoking. The decor is modern and the staff are very friendly and attentive. Our room was called a villa with a king bed and kitchenette. It was a very comfortable and quiet room - sole exception was our amorous neighbors next door. Not a big deal. We got a great rate from the Marriott website so look for specials. You also get a welcome pack with coffee and niceties which was great. I would suggest this place to anyone who wants to be a bit away from the strip but still in walking distance. It's right across from the Miracle Mile Shops where you can buy breakfast or dinner and close to Planet Hollywood. I would also definitely stay there again!	
Nov 21 2007 	Marriott Grand Chateau: A weeks vacation but we didn't buy into the timeshare.	In truth the Marriott Grand Chateau was a nice place to stay, and the ammenities were a little above average. However the price was also a little above average. We had a 1 bedroom villa which included a measter bedroom with king bed, a sofa sleeper in the living room (where the kids slept), a small but full kitchen, and adining table. The extra nice things were: The entire property is 100% total non-smoking! Great for a non-smoking family that does not wish to smell smoke filled rooms, or smoke permeatedcarpet, furniture or linens, pillows, etc. The bathroom has 2 vanities, each with it's own sink. Also, there is a large soaking tub (our kids loved taking baths), and a seperate shower with 2 shower heads. On the down side: During a 6 night stay we only had the daily towel exchange, and the beds made -- which was include in &quot;the daily tidy-up service&quot; -- that was free of charge.Our bed linens were not changed once! The floor was not sweptnor vaccummed. The bath tub and shower not cleaned once.To have the room cleaned once we would have had to pay over $100. for the basic cleaning that usually included free of charge at every other hotel I've ever stayed in. Since this was my vacationI was not going to clean the room myself.Why we decided not to buy into the timeshare program: Simple,we figured out that it was a scam. We had paid $1,295. months in advance for a 6 nigh 7 day vacation. Thats a little over $200. a night. Over $200. a night was a bit pricey for Las Vegas during the &quot;off season - work week&quot; Sunday - Friday stay. Other places had much better deals for the money. Everything was over priced! My husband bought a cheap brand &quot;trial-sized&quot; can ofshave crream that actually read &quot;not for resale&quot; from the store next to the lobby for $5. What was really alarming and made us decide NOT to buy was the outrageous prices added (not included) for a basic cleaning service(s) that was charged to vacation club owners every day. Combine the excessive yearly maintenance fees + daily cleaning fees + $25,000 (with interest)= rip off scam! As if the $25,000 wasn't enough, by the time you add the daily cleaning fees together with the yearly maintenancefees you'd be paying well over $100. a day for a vacation you already paid for in advance. In the long run you save no money buying into a timeshare with Marriott. The Marriott Grand -Chateau was nice, but not nice enough for the price per night.	
Nov 18 2007 	Hope you enjoy walking down 31 flights of stairs....	The property is nice, but still under construction. Fire alarms were being tested at 9:00 am and the electricity was scheduled to be shut off between 6:30 and 7:30 pm. We returned to our room at 5:45 pm pick up some luggage that was needed before 7:30. When we went to the elevator to go down at 6:20, the elevators had already been turned off. No broadcast was made that the schedule had changed (althougth the PA system worked just fine that morning!) We ended up having to carry luggage down 31 flights of steps, and were then harassed by security when we tried to enter the building through the loading dock - the closest entrance to where the stairwell ended.	
Nov 5 2007 	Love It!! Love It!! Love It!!	All i have to say is that I love this place and would come back here all the time from now on. My friends and i had a great time even at the pool in the middle of december. the bar up top was fun to be at and to look at all the lights a places from 38 floors high was the best view ever! the people that work there i felt were very nice and friendly. I will always plan on staying there from now on!!	
Nov 3 2007 	Marriott Grand Chateau.....Swanky	We stayed at the Grand Chateau with friends for two nights in late October. Being hicks from Indiana, I doesn't take much to impress us, and the Grand Chateau does.The Grand Chateau is about a five minute walk behind The Planet Hollywood and the Harley Davidson Restaurant. From that approximate area you are basically in the middle of everything on the strip. The rooms are plush, clean and nice. People complain sometimes about the pool and hot tub on the 38th floor, I say, is the one at your house nicer, because we don't have a pool, and anything's better than nothing. While staying at the GrandChat, you must go eat a Fatburger just down the road on the strip, it's delicious. Also, you got to go see Big Elvis Monday through Friday at Bill'S Gambling Hall beside the Flamingo and Bally's. The show is the next best thing to seeing the King. He is the greatest 500 pound Elvis Impersonator on the face of the earth. And the best part is that it is FREE!!!Overall, the Grand Chateau is nice and I would recommend it highly.	
Sep 30 2007	Very Nice	the Gran Chateu is very nice, and non smoking, which in las vegas is a plus. Customer service very efficient, and the rooms very clean and all have a nice view. The hotel is about two blocks from P.H planet hollywood hotel and casino, and the MGM and so on forh on the strip. The only thing about the Chateu that really needs to go is the pool, horrible!	
Sep 17 2007 	Beautiful property!	We are Marriott timeshare owners in Aruba, so we exchanged our lockoff unit to stay here. The entire place is beautiful and very elegant. I think the unit we were in (3310) might be even nicer than the Aruba Surf Club units. The unit was huge, with a full kitchen, washer and dryer, soaking tub, walk in shower with double shower heads, 42&quot; plasma TV in the living room, and an amazingly comfortable king bed.While it is not &quot;convenient&quot; to stay at a place w/o a casino, it is very nice to be able to walk in here after a night on the strip and be at a clean, smoke free, quiet place.	
Sep 10 2007 	Plus and Minus	This is a beautiful property in a great location. The staff is attentive and friendly. The rooms are fresh and comfortable. The following points can be a plus or minus depending on what you want: The entire property is &quot;no smoking&quot;, it's a time-share so there is no restaraunt, the pool is on the roof and very small and simple, you need to walk or get a cab to get anywhere. It's not a casino so you have to leave the property to gamble. There is very little for children to do and the customers are generally middle aged or older. One tower is completed, the second is constructed and the work going on is inside so noise is at a minimum, HOWEVER, as the third and fourth tower are constructed, the noise will be major and the workers start at 4:30 AM. When the property is completed, there will be a spa and a large pool. The lobby will double or triple in size and other amenities will be added. The best part of this property is the location: MGM is on one side and Planet Hollywood is on the other side. The strip is only steps away. The Chateau is at the South End, which is the most desirable part of the strip. Overall, it's a great place to stay if you want to stay at a quiet, classy place but be near the action. If you need two or three bedrooms and a full kitchen and laundry, nothing beats the Chateau. Remember, this is a time share so if you rent a room you will get maid service. If you buy or trade into it, you have to pay as much as $50 per day to get the room cleaned. You can also just clean it yourself. As I said, my comments are here not to give you an opinion but to give you facts so you can decide for yourself if this is the type of property you might be interested in. I would stay there again but not until the majority of the construcion is completed. Happy Traveling!	
Sep 1 2007	It's OK	This hotel wasn't my 1st choice, but it's what was available as an exchange through my timeshare company. For Vegas, it's considered small. The location was actually great - right around the corner from the strip, so it was accessible to everything, and right across from the Planet Hollywood Miracle Mile Shops. I know most people that go to Vegas, spend very little time at the hotel, but when you want a little down time, there needs to be something to make you want to stick around. Unfortunately, there wasn't anything here like that. The pool (located on the roof on the 38th floor) was very small - about 12 feet long only 3 feet deep. It had a bar, but no snacks, so if you were hungry, you needed to leave the hotel to get food, as the hotel itself had no restaurant either. Thank goodness there was music piped in from a radio (at the pool, that is), otherwise there was no other atmosphere. The hotel was very clean, and the staff was friendly and knowledgeable. The room wasn't bad, although a bit small. I don't know what their actual prices are, so I can't say if it's worth the money, but as I said, if you want location, it's great.	
Aug 29 2007	Awesome hotel with beautiful rooms and a great staff!	We stayed here from June 30th-July 7th, 2007. The hotel is absolutely beautiful and our room was gorgeous. We noticed a minimal amount of noise from the construction, but it did not bother us at all (although we have 2 small children so our tolerance level might be higher than some - lol). The staff was so friendly and went out of their way to make sure we had everything we needed. Anytime we asked for something, the staff was very friendly and accommodating. The room was clean and had everything we could ask for in it. The rooftop pool was a bit small and always filled with kids, but our kids enjoyed it and as the building expands, another pool/pools will be added. The only downside was that the bar on the roof was extremely overpriced for purchasing drinks. If you plan to drink, go to the 7-11 a few blocks away on the Strip or just go gamble at one of the casinos and get them for free! My family and I loved this hotel and would definitely return.	
Aug 6 2007 	Great property rooms 	Stayed here Jul 29 - Aug 5 in a 1 bedroom suite - full kitchen, separate bedroom. The room was nicely decorated and everything looked new and shiny! The lobby/common areas were also very nice, although the rooftop pool is small and there is no shade. Staff was very polite and attentive. Location is great - one block away from the masses on the Strip.There is construction going on all around: this property and Plant Hollywood across the street. We stayed on the 31st floor, facing Harmon St. (even-numbered rooms) and barely heard a thing - our sleep was never interrupted. The rooms that face the other side (odd-numbers) are right next to the construction of the new tower, and might have more of a noise problem. So, to recap, aim for a high floor and an even-numbered room.	
Jul 31 2007 	Super Location	The resort is under construction (like the rest of the city) but they do a good job in keeping the lobby and guest areas clean and quiet. The lobby and rooms are top notch. The pool is inadequate for a resort of this type...no shade, very few chairs and a small area. Go next door to the Planet Hollywood hotel (there is reciprocity). They have two large pools and a huge sunbathing patio. It is also a better location to people watch.The best part about this resort is the location. You are only a half block from the strip and located next to Planet Hollywood (formerly Aladdin). You are very close to NYNY, MGM, Bellagio and Paris. The best bit of advice we picked up on this site was regarding show tickets. Do not buy in advance. Just up the street from the Marriott in the Hawaiian square shopping area is a kiosk that sells 2 for 1 show tickets. They open everyday at 11:00am and have a monitor which lists the available shows and prices. Most are 1/2 price, but some of the more popular shows are available at 1/3 off. All of the shows were available when we were there...Carrot Top, Mamma Mia, Zumanity, etc. Unless you are not flexible or are absolutely set on one particular show, you should definitely buy tickets from the kiosk.The only complainants other than the pool would be with the lack of a restaurant in the hotel. Other than overpriced food from the gift shop, there were no choices. Again though, because of the location you can walk across the street to the Miracle Mile shops and choose from 8-10 restaurants.	
Jul 22 2007 	Very nice experience!	We just got back from a 3-night stay and had a fabulous time! After reading other reviews, I was very concerned about construction noise but it was not a problem at all. They're mostly finished with the exterior of the second tower, so the work is primarily being done inside now. We did hear a little bit of noise occasionally, but certainly not enough to bother us. The two towers will connect at the elevator lobby, so they were working on that area on our floor. Other floors didn't have that construction. So if you're worried about the noise, ask for a room where they're not working on that lobby maybe.The location is great - we were able to walk to the strip in less than 5 minutes, and we were right by Planet Hollywood (and the Miracle Mile shops, as mentioned by a previous reviewer!). The view from the rooftop bar was awesome. We didn't use the pool (rooftop, also), but it looked nice, if a little small. We were told upon check-in that they have a reciprocal agreement with the Polo Towers and Planet Hollywood so we could have used either of those pools as well.In all, an excellent vacation in a quality property.	
Jul 17 2007 	Nice Central Location	We stayed at the Marriott Grand Chateau for 3 nights.It is a nice resort centrally located. It was very quite/sound proof.I would not recommend it for children since there really isn't much there to offer them, but it worked out great for adults.One nice &quot;deal&quot; is to walk right across the stree to the Miracle Mile Shops and go to Oceans 1 for Happy Hour. They offer 3 for the price of 1 drinks from 3-7 pm! Such a deal...and they have pretty decent food for a very resonable price. We ate breakfast there for $5.99 each too!	
Jul 9 2007 	BEWARE of extreme NOISE!!	Date July 9th,2007 We just returned after spending a week in Vegas. we tradedour Aruba week for Marriott's Grand Chateau. We should have taken the advice about the noise from construction.It starts at 4:30A.M. sharp with the pile drivers BOOM BOOM BOOM - the cement trucks backing up BEEP BEEP BEEP no need for an alarm clock. You don't want a room facing Planet Hollywood's new consruction.We requested(asked kindly) when we made the reservation not to be on the side of constuction and each day to be moved to the other side when they put us on that side they refused to move us-lucky for us July 4th was a holiday for the construction workers.The staff needs alot of training on hospitality and customer service most questions seemed like you were interrupting their vitial paper work or their social conversations.The concierge is very curt in answering your question and not willing to give advice and can't wait to get rid of you if you have a question. Waiting in line for the shuttle on Sat,Sun or Mon to the supermarket as it is a first come first serve and we have been waiting since 8.30am that morning inside the lobby as told by the concierge and went outside in the heat about 8.45am to wait but still did not get on the bus but others who just showed up at 9am got on board as it can only seat 14 passengers and we had to wait another 30 minutes for the shuttle to drop the 1st load of guest and come back to get us ( No sign up sheet). The pool on the roof is the smallest pool we have ever seen at a Marriott.The one positive were the drivers of the shuttle van ,they were friendly and informative.We finally had enough gave up our last three days and moved to Treasure Island.Our advice would be if you are going to stay here have them guarantee you by e-mail not to be on the side of Planet Hollywood or below a floor they are remodeling. There is NO mid-week cleaning unless you want to pay for the service however towel serviceis free upon request.	
Jun 27 2007 	2 Big Thumbs Up!!!	We are owners here of the 3 bedroom, which most know there is only 1 per floor and they overlook the strip, at least in Tower 1. I have no idea what you'll see from them in Tower 2, 3 or 4.We never heard a single bit of construction noise, enjoyed the whole week, had a great time.The place is amazing, your basic Marriott Timeshare I'd say. The pool is lacking but they are putting in another one and you can go next door to the Polo Towers and use their pool and waterpark, just ask for a pass downstairs.It is right next door the to Aladdin, oh sorry, now Planet Hollywood. There are no slimy nightclubs or alleys to walk thru to get to the strip. Just go out of the chateau go right across the street to the Aladdin/PH and there you are! From the Aladdin you can go to any other casino you'd like. If you are walking in alleys and slimy areas then you are going the wrong way...LOLThe 3 bedroom is huge, almost 2200 square feet and accomodated our crowd of 12 perfectly.We'll stay again and again and I'd highly recommend it.	
Jun 8 2007 	Noisy!!	I agree with the last review. Its a great hotel if you dont wish to sleep on yout holidays! Every morning we were woken up at 4.30 am on the dot. The rooms and lobby are excellent but this does not make up for the noise you will hear while on your visit. The service is of typical marriott standard i.e. excellent, but the resort will only be worth staying at when it is completely finished.	
May 30 2007 	Holiday in Construction Yard!!!	What can I say??? I think Las Vegas is amazing but this hotel is not!!! The construction work next to the tower is so loud that you cannot sleep. This is not a problem if it was during the day except work begins at 5:00am!!!!! Everyday of the week without fail!!! Other than that, the hotel looked nice on the inside and service was ok here and there. Somewhat disappointing. Room was quite dirty and the pool was far too small for the number of people there. Would not visit again or at least till the construction work has finished in 2014!!!!!!!!!!!! Im not joking! It is 2014!	
May 21 2007 	Good not great	We stayed at the Gran Chateau as part of a time share exchange. The lobby is gorgeous, the rooms are very comfortable but the place suffers from the lack of a restaurant. While you can walk across the street to the &quot;Miracle Mile&quot; mall, not having access to room service or breakfast is a definite downside to staying at the Gran Chateau. Also, we were awakened early during the week by construction starting at 6:30 a.m. The pool needs some shade, given the 100 degree heat in Las Vegas, but the rooftop bar was nice.	
May 15 2007	Pleasant Surprise	My husband, adult daughter, and I just returned from a week at the Grand Chateau. I was apprehensive after reading the reports of early morning construction. While we occasionally heard noise above the master bath area, that was the only disruption. We loved the quiet elegance of the Grand Chateau. The rooms were comfortable and clean and the staff couldn't have been more gracious. We've stayed at Marriott time shares all over the country and this was our favorite!	
Apr 24 2007 	Stayed Grand in Las Vegas	My husband and I stayed at the Marriott Grand Chateau through a trade with our time share. We have never been to Las Vegas and were unsure of what to expect. We were thrilled to walk into the lobby to see a beautiful sight. Even though the hotel is still under construction, you couldn't tell once you were inside. The rooms were immaculate....the roof top pool is small, but has a great view. It is fun to take a break from the craziness of Vegas and sit at the roof top pool bar. The mid-afternoon bartender is great...This is definitely a must stay at.	
Apr 2 2007 	think twice	staff was for the most part unfriendly and uncaring. They always treaed questions as if we were bothering their work. We own here but willnever stay here again.	
Mar 27 2007 	Very clean but not a hotel	Very nice and new - all rooms mini suite - great shower with 2 heads. Hollywood style - Jack and Jill style bathroom gave some privacy. Staff very friendly. But have to walk in slimy area - nightclubs - parking alleys etc to get to any casinos or the strip.Started construction banging at 4 AM! Yes, 4 AM - and there is a note in the room warning you that they will do this! Steel worker - tool belt and all - could look right in to my bedroom window at 4 AM - wavd at me!No restaurant - room service - snacks.Maid service was very poor - restraightened bed, emptied garbage and refreshed towels but didn;t vacuum, take away wrappers of soap, etc. Didn't change bed.There are better deals on the strip with more amenities.	
Mar 22 2007 	Good for group getaways!	Only a few drawbacks: our plasma screen bummed out and the management did nothing to compensate us (it was during March Madness, and it mattered!); the hotel provided no hair conditioner or lotion which we found odd; and the maid service was &quot;light&quot; as advertised. The great? Location, location, location; cleanliness; comfort of beds; spaciousness of bathrooms; amenities that included a dishwasher and laundry in our suite as well as a full kitchen and all utensils, blender, dishes, etc., and with a big group, the per person price was reasonable for such a new place. The pool was small, but the setting pleasurable with a good view and more than ample amenities.	
Mar 13 2007 	LOVED IT!!	We are new owners of a timeshare with Grand Chateau and used it for the first time in February. We own a 1 bedroom villa and we loved it. The three of us stayed on the 34th floor, room 309 to be exact. The view was spectacular and we had all the necessities we needed. The only complaint I have is when you do laundry, you have to leave the door open or your clothes won't dry. There is no ventilation in the closet. Before we left I read so many reviews complaining about the construction but it really didn't bother us at all. The staff was great! I am truly happy we purchased with Marriot.	
Feb 27 2007	Great Choice For Family Vacation in Las Vegas	If you are looking for a great hotel to bring your family to in Vegas, the Grand Chateau is the place!-This is a Marriott Vacation Club property in the heart of Vegas. It's a 2 minute walk to the strip, and right beside the Planet Hollywood, formerly the Alladin.-Perfect hotel for families with small children. It doesn't have a casino attached to it, so you could avoid the typical smoky Vegas hotel atmosphere. Yet, it's a close enough walk for adults to have some gambling and night time fun.-Large rooms that are very clean. We got a studio suite which included a king bed, pull-out sofa, large bathroom and small kitchenette.-Great rooftop pool.-The only downside is that there is no on-site restraurant, but since it's right in the middle of the strip, you are not far away from some great dining. The hotel will give you menus of local restaurants that deliver as well if you'd like to have a meal in your room.Overall, an A+++!	
Jan 1 2007 	awesome facility	We stayed in a lockout unit for one week over the christmas holiday. I was a bit concerned that it would be a long time to spend in a hotel room but was very surprised. The room was spacious and provided you with a full size microwave and small fridge. We made coffee in the room everyday and had a place to put some beer and wine. The staff was great and the room was very well appointed. We did hear a bit of construction noise but it came from the surrounding area. They are building a W resort next door and this was some of the noise we heard. Only complaint was the pillows were flat so we bought some at Costco. We rented from an owner and if we wanted housekeeping service which included changing the sheets it was 42.00 which is a bit high. They will give you fresh towels whenever you need them. I would atay at this hotel again the location is great we walked accross the street to the Aladin hotel which was in the middle of the strip. As mentioned the pool on the roof was tiny but the view is awesome. I would stay here again in a minute.	
Dec 28 2006 	Loved it!	My husband and I stayed here the week before Christmas and every bit of our stay was perfect. Every employee we encountered was wonderful. Although the resort is under construction and they start by 5 AM, this didn't disrupt our stay at all, even though we had a room close to the construction. The only disappointment was that there is very little windblocking on the roof and that is where the only spa is...so, it being Vegas in Dec, we couldn't go in the spa, even though it was open and hot. As usual, we avoided the high pressure sales pitch that is at most of these ownership properties, I would recommend that others do the same. Great location though, being right next to the Alladin puts it within walking distance of almost anything in Vegas, and they run a shuttle to Fashion Show mall almost every hour. I will stay there again next time I go to Vegas.	
Dec 14 2006 	Will be great	This eventually will be a great property when it is completed. Awesome location between the Aladdin and the MGM. Big, spacious, beautifully appointed rooms, comfortable beds and close to all the action. The only downside was the construction noise (which was minimal) and the service. We had to ask several times for towels and someone to come by to pick up dirty linens. Remember, this is ultimately a timeshare property. Look forward to visiting again in the future. Overall, extremely satisfied.	
Nov 15 2006 	Nice room not ready for prime time.	We stayed from a Friday until Wednesday. The good first: the one bedroom that we had was nicely appointed and comfortable. The bed and pillows were perfectly nice. The kitchen was well equipped. The bathroom had a double head shower which was nice. The management staff and personnel were friendly and accomodating, as were the folks in the kids playroom off the lobby. Even better, for Las Vegas, is that there is no casino and no smoking, making the lobby actually pleasant. There weren't even the usual lines for taxis and the hotel is situated across the street from the many restaurants at the Aladdin's mall. The 24° marketplace in the lobby is useful though expensive. Now the downside: the construction begins at 4:30am. Yes, that's 4:30 in the morning, with banging and usual construction noise. There's no sleeping after 4:30, so there's no staying up much past 8pm if you want a reasonable night's sleep. The fire alarm blasted with a false alarm once at 10:30pm, waking our 2 year old, and generally making a mess of one of our nights. The building itself seems to have been built without any insulation between floors or along the plumbing lines. So when anyone above or beside us took a shower, flushed the toilet, or ran the bathtub, we not only knew about it but had to raise our voices to hold a discussion. While shampoo is provided, there's no conditioner. At $349/night, we expect conditioner, especially when you're in Vegas (and really need conditioner for the dry air). Towels are good, but not up to what one would expect for the price paid. Bottom line: it's nice for the family to have a refrigerator and full kitchen, not to mention some extra space for the kids, but this isn't quite ready for prime time yet - and I'd hope they spend a few more dollars on the other towers to adequately insulate between rooms.	
Oct 4 2006 	No Frills - Not so Grand!	Las Vegas is a city that never sleeps - nor will you at this hotel on weekdays for the next few years. Be warned - the construction on their second tower and also in the surrounding lots starts at 4:30 AM and can be heard from every room. The hotel does put an apology note in each room - but by the time that the guests find out about the problem - it's too late to relocate without financial penalties. The hotel/time share has none of the excitement that is typical of Las Vegas - no restaurants, no gambling, no entertainment. It's set back off the strip in the middle of alot of construction. The staff pointed out that in a few years they will be considered to have a fine location when the construciton in the immediate area is finished. They do have a shuttle that goes back and forth to the Fashion Mall a few times during the day. Their rooftop swimming pool and hot tub were too small - the only plus is that they stay open later than the hotels. The Grand Chateau is not a hotel - it's a Time Share and part of the Marriott Vacation Club. Be prepared to be approached by their sales staff to sit through a two hour presentation with the promise of some gifts- the gifts are some discounts at minor shows or meals. They are not the only ones who actively hunt for prospective buyers...Marriott is not as agressive as other companies in LV - like Fairfield Resorts - whose representatives will actually jump in front of you as you walk along the strip. Other negatives were that our questions and requests to housekeeping, maintenance and the concierge were not taken care of. Some younger staff members that we encountered seemed disinterested in their roles and were not helpful. Our room had a shower that leaked and caused floods on the bathroom floor. This was reported to the front desk four times and nothing was done. We could also hear guests in the next room filling up their bathtub at midnight - the sound of it draining out was very distrubing as well. The only postive is that their set up with the kitchen, dining room and washer/dryer ,sleep sofa will be appreciated by families in contrast with the typical hotel room. They only provide a Tidy Up Maid service - they give clean towels daily - but do not change the sheets or wash bathrooms or floors,etc. There may be an additional charge for full maid service for Time Share owners who want it. Maid service may be available for Non Time Share guests. Right now the furniture and bedding are only a year old and everything looks fresh and attractive. Helpful Hint about booking your stay anywhere in LV : Prices at the hotels fluctuate daily - to get the best rates - book online and check out the Hot Deals. If you find a lower rate for your room before you arrive the hotels will reduce the rates. Most hotels will give their guests discount coupons for buffets and shows upon check in ...ask at the front desk what is available.	
Oct 3 2006 	Great Hotel 	The Marriott Grand Chateau was simply great. I had an one bedroom condo for the whole week, which was very modern and clean, I'll have to say, this was the best time share condo that I have every stayed in. The service was exceptional. I didn't hear the construction at all. I loved the Plasma TV, now I think I will buy one for my home. The cookies and lemonaid was a suprising treat as well as the greeting breakfast. We took the Anne Benanne tour through the Mohave Desert which I found out about at the greeting breakfast. I would recommend the tour to anyone who wants to get a flavor of the country side. The tour guide was full of information, polite and courteous and he picked me up at the hotel.In closing, I would love to stay the the Marriott Grand Chateau again.	
Sep 29 2006 	GREAT PLACE THE MARRIOTT CHATEAU	We are owners of this time share and this was our first visit since the first tower was built. The rooms are beautiful with lots of space. Master bathroom is large with dual showerheads. We had a shower door that was leaking. No problem Maintance was up to our room in no time. Only drawback was we were on the side of the Marriott that they are building on..up at 5am with construction noise. But was able to go back to sleep. The pool is small but they are going to have another one. Who uses the pool when you have so much to see and do anyway. Pool bar very nice and the view of the strip from the roof was beautiful.The staff is very friendly.. Just a note. If you need to use the store in the marriott cross over to Polo Towers. There store is a little less expensive.There were 5 of us we own a 2 bedroom unit. Everyone was very happy with the room's and staff. It was very nice to call the Valet and have the car waiting when you needed it. Those young men and woman were always very friendly.If your an Eagles fan you have to check out Blondies at the desert passage at the aladen.	
Sep 5 2006 	Very Nice 	We just got back in yesterday from Marriott Grand Chateau. Stayed Sept 2-4th Labor Day weekend for birthday celebration for my boyfriend and sister. Therefore I booked a 2-bedroom villa , about 1200sq ft. Plenty room, huge jacuzzi tub, separte vanites and separate areas for his/hers, and same for showers, very very clean hotel, im very clean person. Requested early checkin day before with CARA at front desk, flew in , went to front desk, met CARA said had only 1 part of my room available to checkin, which was fine, just happened to be my master bedroom! Check out was a breeze, loved store downstairs especially when i was looking for late nite soda's and drinks 3am from dry desert heat without leaving hotel, also vending machine on each floor only accessed by room key, as the pool(very small, at 108 degrees would loved to swim but lots kids around at time, good family time for them, so went to room soaked in my 2 person jacuzzi all nite! Valet guys are cool, and helpful, they told us on free marriott shuttle to fashion show mall we took, very very nice luxury shuttle, tv's, leather seats like a limo, helped out for short cut to wynn's hotel. Nice Hotel, but im a starwood preferred guest for life (westin/W's always).Ran across time share guy who works there showing a room at the elevator, little to nosy for me, but he was nice. Have no complaints at this hotel, highly recommend ! Cut through the alladin and hit the strip good location !	
Aug 31 2006 	Good location next to Aladdin	We stayed here August 11-13 in a one bedroom villa. Our first impression was that the valet parking people were a bit harried. There was no self parking and the valets were getting impatient with drivers failing to understand their normal routine!Reception was very courteous, but they informed me that they did not have a room of the type I had booked available unless I chose a smoking room - which I did not want. They offered me instead a &quot;master room suite&quot; with ajoining bedroom, but did not indicate that it was a downgrade. I ended up with the 'smoking' villa. The couple next to me were having even less luck. They were being lectured by another staffer on the importance of getting a Marriott Confirmation number in addition to their Guest Certificate confirmation number from Interval (Que?) and were apparently being refused their room. The room itself was clean and in good condition, with full amenities (unlike the master bedroom option which only has a mini kitchen - thanks to my research I knew this when checking in). The Grand Chateau is indeed a big house, and not a proper five star hotel - there are very few ancilliary amenities that you might expect in such an establishment. The pool is the same size as when viewed from outer space.The Strip is only a block away with Aladdin;s being the closest. Turn left two blocks and you can reach New York New York. You would be amazed however at how exhausting it is in the summer heat just to reach those locations on foot. On a Saturday Night it took us one hour by bus to get back from the Stratosphere on the other end of the Strip because of the traffic!Overall I would stay here again - but Marriott need to work on the details.	
Aug 24 2006 	Not bad	Room was nice and spacious, but expected more on-site amenties. The workout room is great, but the pool is a postage stamp and usually filled w/kids. Lots of free HBO channels. Mini-kitchen is nice and handy.	
Aug 9 2006 	A Very Convenient comfortable Location	We stayed at the Marriott Grand Chateau from 7/12/2006 -7/19/2006 and we enjoyed our first trip to Las Vegas very much. We stayed in a 2 bedroom on the 22nd floor which had beautiful views of the strip. Staff was friendly and helpful and did everything they could to accomodate our needs. Easy to walk to most of the popular spots on the strip and a free shuttle is provided to the Fashion Mall a few blocks away. We were warned about noise from construction but we did not hear anything. We are Marriott owners and had exchanged our timeshare in Palm Desert for this one and we were very happy with the trade.	
Aug 5 2006 	Great view nice hotel	We stayed for three nights (with a 2-hour timeshare presentation) in a &quot;guest room&quot; on the 26th floor for $170. The current view from Grand Chateau would be hard to beat. It is incredible. In a couple years, that will chang - possibly dramatically - as a taller Planet Hollywood is planned for across the street and the Grand Chateau will be expanding. The hotel is in a great location across the street from the Aladdin (future Planet Hollywood) only a half block from the strip. The rooms were very nice and the staff were excellent.	
Jul 26 2006 	Great hotel	We stayed here before, during &amp; after our wedding. we married on 30/05/06, the hotel did not help us to celebrate (despite being in our wedding outfits)....this was a little disappointing. However the hotel was great, rooms spacious &amp; clean. We loved the oversized tub in the bedroom (great for the wedding night!!!). the hotel is very close to the strip which is great....look out for the golf cart, this will take you to the strip at no cost.	
Jul 17 2006	Great Location	My husband and I just returned from a vist to Marriott's Grand Chateau in Las Vegas. It is truly a beautiful hotel with a wonderful and attentive staff. The location on the strip was great simply because it was not as crowded and traffic was not as bad. We stayed in a one bedroom with a kitchen. We had plenty of room and the kitchen was well equipped. The plasma television was great and we had a wonderful view of the MGM and New York, New York which was breathtaking at night. We had a wonderful time watching the sunset each evening on the roof top of the hotel. The pool is small but how much time are you actually going to spend swimming in Las Vegas? The bar staff was great especially Steve and Randy from Hawaii. The only complaint I have is the noise the pipes make when a neigbor decides to fill thier pool of a soaking tub. The noise is unbelieveably loud and quite irritating when it happens in the middle of the night! I made this comment to the person checking me out as we left and was told that they were making note of this and hopefully it would not be a problem when the new tower is finished. That is great, but what about the poor people who have to stay in the first tower!! The hotel is currently in construction mode and we were met in the lobby with an announcement that we might experience some construction noise but we never heard a peep. You could see the men working as street level but as guests, we were not bothered by them.	
Jun 30 2006	Marvelous Marriott	Stayed for one week on timeshare exchange. Rooms and service outstanding. No noise at all from construction nearby. Cars ready for us at a moment's notice and concierge very helpful.Would like to see a larger pool and more amenities but may take some time as buildout won't be for several years.	
Jun 14 2006	Can't say enough good things about this place	We just returned from a one week stay at the Marriott Grand Chateau. The entire staff was courteous, friendly, and did everything to make sure that our stay was enjoyable. The villa was immaculate, well furnished, spacious and comfortable. The location is great a short walk to the strip between the MGM Grand and the Alladin. We were on the 31st floor and the view of the strip was awesome. I would recommend this place to anyone, you can't go wrong.	
Jun 4 2006	Can't go wrong with a Marriott!	We totally enjoyed our stay at the Marriott Grand Chateau, just a block off strip. It's next to Alladin Casino.There is a wonderful mall inside (Desert Passage)Everything was excellent! We had a one bedroom, and we brought our 21 yr old daughter for college graduation gift. She slept on the pull out which she said was very comfortable. The 42&quot; flat screen TV was great. The big tub was excellent. The shower was for two, it had two shower heads on opposite side. The view was wonderful, we were on the 30th floor. We didn't use the pool, looked nice (small) but the bar was nice with a spectacular view of the city. The Marketplace was well stocked with anything from hot coffee, ice cream, snacks, frozen dinners, etc. And of course its in Las Vegas! We walked to most casinos from the hotel. Theres the monorail too, helps the walk back	
Apr 15 2006	Great Place and Great Location	Stayed for a full week at the Grand Chateau in the full two bedroom with lock off option. I loved the rooms, no complaints there. The staff couldn't have been more friendly and helpful. The only complaints I have is that all of the pillows are feather filled (I like regular pillows) and it is sometimes difficult to get a cab. We ended up walking to the Aladdin to get cabs most of the time. (less than five minutes) We agree with most other posts that the pool is ridiculously small but for some reason it was never crowded. The sign on the wall states maximum occupancy is 45 but I don't think more than 20 people were ever up there at a time. The sky bar had some good drink specials. The mango colodas were exceptionally good. We ate at Neros at Caesars and Voodoo lounge at the Rio. Both were excellent. We went to Kokomos at the Mirage for dinner also but aren't too happy with the remodel. Too modern for my taste. The food was great as always but again I didn't like the new decor. We saw Elton John and also highly recommend that show. Went to the Rio and saw the Scintas. Another excellent show. The Chateau is one block off the strip and a very short walk to MGM, NYNY, Monte Carlo and Aladdin. There were a few mini markets in the area to pick up snacks and drinks but we went to Albertsons the first day in a cab and stocked up on groceries. It was very convenient to eat breakfast and lunch in the room. We go to Las Vegas five times a year and have always stayed in a casino. I never felt like I was missing any action by staying in the time share. It was so much more enjoyable and relaxing and I can't wait to go back next year.
