	It suited our needs	Just as most of the reviews state, room is small and dated but clean, staff very friendly, drink service in casino very good, excellent location. For a few more dollars would probably stay at GN again next time.	
	A Good Value in Downtown Las Vegas	I just returned from a 6-night stay at the Four Queens. The room was a little dated, but it was clean and comfortable. There's an ironing board and iron in the room, and I really appreciated having a coffee maker in the room. There was also a safe that was more than big enough to fit my laptop, which was good.Some people I talked to said that the water pressure in their shower was way too high, making it uncomfortable, but that wasn't a problem for me. The bathroom was very small, though.The hotel is in a great location, with the Fremont Street Experience right outside the door, so I was able to go down and see whichever shows I wanted to see throughout the week without making a special trip. Also, the Deuce bus to the Strip and the outlet stores is nearby, so that's really convenient. I stayed on the Strip once before, and you have to take a bus to get up and down it anyway, so staying downtown seemed better to me. I got to see whatever I wanted to on the Strip, but I saw more of Fremont Street than I would have otherwise.Plus, the Four Queens Casino was one of the few places I found that had 9/6 jacks or better video poker. I managed to get a royal flush, so the trip more than payed for itself!	
	4 Queens= Silver Strike	I arrived to hotel and registered easily and quickly, the front staff were friendly and effeien, no long lines. The garage has a few spaces for self park so you can park and unload your luggage. I would suggest parking on the top floor next to the elevator, its not crowded up there. (I think they charge $3 for parking per day to your room)We got a nice room on a high floor #1821, I uploaded pictures, see for yourself. The room was clean, quiet with a killer view. The cleaning people were nice and very polite. Sign up for the member card they give you free slot machine credits and discounts for the restaurants. I would not recommend the restaurant, food tasted old, freezer made the waitress was aloof and the cashier was ok. Room service did not answer, but eventually called back room :C My husband loved the silver strike slots, only the red were silver. Any who, overall its great for the price, so live a little and book some fun on a budget at this hotel :D cheers	
	Downtown exprerient	We just returned from our vacation in Las Vegas.. We stayed at the Four Queens, I was a little scared after reading the reviews from some other travelers.. Stating how the room was so small and the staff was rude..etc..We actually had a great time.. The room was clean and bed comfortable..we stay 3 nights and paid only $27.00 a night &amp; 2 night free. Plus $50.00 com. for slots machine. we don't have to pay parking like another traveler said. The staff all were nice and friendly.. The rooms were cleaned daily and we would definitley stay there again..	
Nov 23 2009 	Las Vegas	Good Time was had by all. Rooms were clean and tidy, but dated. Need some remodeling	
Nov 20 2009 	Good Location Good Value	I have stayed 3 times here this summer. Ask for the West tower away from Fremont street. Newer rooms. You are right in the middle of everything. No need for a car if you want to stay downtown. Lots of security around. You can take the bus to the strip. Good, cheap food in the restaurants. A lot of places to eat around Fremont ST.	
Nov 19 2009 	Great place - cheap rooms	It's only $50 on weekdays but when the weekend comes it goes up to $100-$150 per night. Nice small rooms with 2 beds and a T.V. Good shower/bathroom. Right in the middle of Freemont Street, close to local bars in old las vegas.	
Nov 18 2009 	Okay For The Price	It is an older hotel with basic rooms that have been spruced up a bit. Our view of a cement wall was not great and the walls between rooms are thin - we could clearly hear the folks next door. It was not stated during booking but there is a $3.00 daily parking fee. It isn't a place we would return to.	
Nov 5 2009 	its all good	The room was nice and clean, no odours like other older hotels I have stayed in.I had a room on the 4th floor overlooking the Fremont experience, it was a little noiseyat the top of each hour (untill 11pm), but I enjoyed it. The room was 25 dollars anight.....you can't beat that. I would stay there again.	
Nov 1 2009 	Great value great fun	My husband and I stayed for four nights. On check in, I requested a quiet room and certainly received it - we were not bothered by any noise at any time. The room was clean, with a fridge, which was useful for snacks and drinks. The hotel is old and a little worn but is very clean, staff is friendly, the location is great and prices very reasonable. We went to the comedy show and it was hilarious. Won at slots and had a great dinner at the hotel coffee shop, Magnolia. We would stay here again.	
Oct 31 2009 	Well worth the price	We enjoyed a three-night stay, and found the staff to be friendly, helpful, and generous with the half-price coupons for Magnolia's Veranda. The wait at Magnolia's got tedious during busy hours, but the service was great, and the portions generous. The Chicago Brew Pub is small but inviting, and the beers were a hit. We missed Hugo's Cellar, and the small donut/deli/coffee shop is defunct.The room on the back side of the South Tower was nice and clean, the queen beds were comfortable. Bathroom was rather small for the room, but clean and restocked daily with fresh, thick towels, soaps, and shampoo. During our stay, the electric outlet for the desk area did not work, we had to make coffee on the floor, elsewhere in the room - and couldn't use the lamp. The two-lamp light fixture between the beds was broken, requiring us to unscrew one bulb to turn that light off. The telephone didn't work. The music from Fremont Street can be heard as a rumble, but is not too bad.The casino is just a little crowded in busy times, and they follow the Vegas tradition of not putting out benches or chairs anywhere - in spite of the numbers of middle-aged and elderly patrons they get every year. The conversion of Fremont street to a pedestrian mall is a wonderful development that allows people to simply cruise between the casinos and the Fremont street vendors with ease.Overall, it was a pretty good place, and we will be back. Had we spent more time in our room...we might have tried to get another with working fixtures - but it was not that important to us, so we did not complain.	
Oct 29 2009 	Less Than What I Expected	The main reason that I booked a room at this hotel was because most of the activities that were being held for our class reunion were in the adjacent hotels and bars - really convenient. Staying here allowed us to walk next door without having to deal with traffic and parking. The room is really quite dated and is in need of an update. The bathroom is quite small. Our room was on the fifth floor with a nice view of the huge roof top equipment - oh well, it's not as if we kept the curtains open anyway. My biggest complaint was with the plumbing - the sink and tub have really slow drain issues. I called the front desk to connect me to housekeeping but the woman responded in a sassy tone that I should call building engineering. I said I don't care who I should be calling, just get someone to fix it. Also, the shower head was super strong. I think that's why the tub drain was so slow. I will probably not stay at this hotel again.	
Oct 28 2009 	Bring ear plugs	We were in room 608 in the North Tower which overlooked the Fremont Street Experience and it was great UNTIL we tried to go to sleep. The 'Experience' continues with loud music and bright lights until midnight but the announcements, revelers etc continue well into the night/all night.. We were told that there were no earplugs available at the hotel. The front desk manager told us we should have been warned at check in that the room faced this revelery but alas we were not. The A/C system was quite loud in the room with it thunking on and off all night. We also were able to hear the neighbors shower as if it were our own in the am. That said the room was quite adequate, clean and large enough. The personnel was fun and helpful (except for the earplugs) and Dante makes a mighty fine margarita - ask for the real kind not the special. Staying on Fremont Street was great since it is all there with drinks to go with your 'bag of chips' PS room 600 in the same tower is directly across from the elevator.	
Oct 26 2009 	Would Stay there again!!!!	We just returned from our vacation in Las Vegas.. We stayed at the Four Queens, I was a little scared after reading the reviews from some other travelers.. Stating how the room was so small and the staff was rude..etc..We actually had a great time.. The room was clean and bed comfortable..The staff all were nice and friendly.. The rooms were cleaned daily and we would definitley stay there again..	
Oct 25 2009 	Outstanding Service!	Just wanted to say how much fun we had downtown at the Four Queens! Our Vegas experience was much more enjoyable because of all the friendly staff members at the hotel/casino. We did not stay here, but have in the past and loved it. The dealers and pit bosses were absolutely outstanding. Thank you, and see you in March!!!	
Oct 24 2009 	Outstanding Experience	We booked seven rooms for the week. Without exception our experience was outstanding. The front desk was very attentive to our needs. Housekeeping did an outstanding job. Everyone in the hotel and restaurants made you feel as if you are the only guest. We will definitely be back.	
Oct 20 2009 	good pick	after having arrived after 14 hour flight we booked into 4 queens, looking forward to having a early night were given a lovely room, with everything in it but the bed.,,,after contacting front desk was given another room...even with entertainment going on in the street we had good comfprtable bed...had no trouble sleeping. would not hesitate staying again...much prefer fremont street to the strip...costwise we only paid $50 for the room	
Oct 20 2009 	Nice hotel great value good downtown location	My wife and I stayed here on our way out to California. We had no reservations until we checked online prices early the same evening and got a great price @ less than 30/nt. I've stayed at the Golden Nugget which is nicer but much more expensive. We just needed a place to rest that night. We didn't eat at any restaurants so I can't evaluate them. The room was nice, nothing fancy, but was very clean which for us is the main thing. Played a little poker at the nugget's room and did well so made it an even better stay. Check in was quick, staff were friendly and courteous. I asked for a quiet room and got just that. There was no charge for self parking which other reviewers apparently did not experience. We will certainly consider staying here again.	
Oct 14 2009 	Never Again	Room was more like a closet - got clean towels and nothing else - hair dryer did not work - most of outlets in room did not work-no business suite except for a very expensive pc/printer-no free ISP available - service in Magnolias was mediocre at best, our group of 3 couples caused major confusions on every check. You really have to watch the dealers - caught a couple of them pulling tricks for what they thought was someone who was not watching. There is no control in the casino area - too many very loud people who were out of control with noise and language - staff did nothing. Was on the 16th floor and could not wait to get home due to noise from street ALL NIGHT long. Gift shop or player club was not open when I left at 700 so no gifts, and could not take advantage of my player card. Cheap yes - inside from top to bottom. The only nice about this visit was the young lady named Rachel who checked us into the hotel.	
Oct 14 2009 	Fabulous Fremont n Four Queens	Vegas is absolutely fantastic and if you haven't been before, stay on The Strip just to get a feel of it, after that stay on Fremont and the Four Queens and get a taste of downtown. This was our 4th year running at Four Queens and only a few mishaps were promptly resolved. We arrived in vegas, got our car and checked in, we booked a standard room, good value for the price £21 per night, we went out had a few drinks had a bite to eat and retired for an earlyish night. We were woken up 3 times in the night by our noisy neighbours demonstarting their sexual prowess. The next day we went out for breakfast (Paradise buffet - excellent) feeling tired and violated, on returning to the hotel we went to the front desk, where we explained the situation. They repeatedly appologised and promptly upgraded us to to a suite which was gorgeous. We love the Four Queens, the staff are attentive, the location is brilliant and the $7.99 prime rib dinner is great value.	
Oct 14 2009 	over-rated	confusing finding the lift to the room, had to drag luggage through the casino full of peopleone of the best locations in freemont st, but no comparison to the strip, we didnt feel as safe walking around.shower pressure was ridiculously strong, to the point of stinging !sink tap came off when i used itpremium factory outlet was good for shopping	
Oct 10 2009 	It was a comfortable fun experience from check-in to check out.	The rooms are not the fanciest I've stayed in, but our room was clean and comfortable, with windows that actually opened to allow fresh air into the room (a rarity these days, and much appreciated!), and a sizeable flat-screen television with a good selection of channels. The hotel has reasonably priced internet service (about half the price of the hotel we stayed in on &quot;the Strip.&quot; From the moment we checked in until the moment we checked out, the hotel staff members were invariably friendly and accommodating. The hotel's restaurant serves delicious chicken fried steak, among many other delicious offerings. It is one of the better restaurants in the casinos in downtown Las Vegas. (I also recommend the buffet at the Main Street Station hotel / casino). The Fremont Street light show was fun, and the &quot;Summer of '69 Woodstock TributePalooza&quot; free musical entertainment was also a good show. The Four Queens Casino has affordable ($3 and $5) tables for those of us who don't like to &quot;bet the house,&quot; and a huge variety of fun slots. Additionally, unlike some of the &quot;high end&quot; casinos on the strip, the coctail waitresses actually serve the penny slot machines and bring your drinks back fairly quickly. And, we won money! What could be better, really? We'll definitely return!	
Oct 9 2009 	Great as always!	My wife and I just completed our bi-annual trip to Vegas and stayed at the 4 Queens for the 6th time. Check in took 5 minutes at 9:00 pm and we asked for a north tower room away from Fremont and were taken care of quickly. The rooms are small but very functional. We never waited more that 5 minutes, usually less than 1, for an elevator. We parked in the garage and never had any problems except with the construction in the downtown area which has got a lot of streets messed up. Check out was also quick, everyone we dealt with was friendly and accomodating and I would highly recommend the Queens for anyone looking for cheap, clean rooms.	
Oct 7 2009 	Very Nice	I stayed at the 4queens 25 years ago so and expected an old run down hotel but to my surprise it was a Beautiful and very clean room, Everyone at the hotel was nice and helpful and the location cant be beat. I will never stay on the strip again, Downtown is WAAAAAY more fun. I highly recommend the 4queens!!!	
Oct 2 2009 	Downtown GREAT - Four Queens Less than Great	Downtown is a different experience compared to the strip. Street Party atmosphere, with everyone having a great time. Stayed in a petite suite on the 16th floor, opposite side of the Freemont Street Experience. Room was comfortable with normal amenities, to include a sitting area. Tile counters in baths, tub/shower combo. Room was clean and hotel service staff was fantastic to all my needs. The casino is small, and for the most part very friendly and accomodating. Except 2 pit supervisors who are very rude to everyone, even the dealers. One was yelling and screaming at them, which should have been done behind closed doors. The other was just laughing at the yelling, even at the point when he yelled, &quot;they should all be fired!!&quot;. Found out shortly when I requested to speak to a casino supervisor regarding the very unprofessionalism of the pit supervisors, that the casino supervisor was on duty, at the other pit, saw the entire thing and was laughing with them. Very unprofessional for a service business to air their dirty laundry in front of clients. The next day, saw one of the idiot pit supervisors and asked what time a certain table game was going to open, he said, &quot;don't know, don't care what you want&quot;. A couple of bad apples can ruin the entire barrel, and they have ruined the fun times at the casino. Plain and pure &quot;stupidity&quot;, and casino management does not seem to care. There are much better places to gamble where everyone can have fun and relax. Hotel has NO spa, NO pool (can use sister property's pool). Does not compare to Golden Nugget next door.	
Sep 30 2009 	Stay somewhere else no pool make you pay for parking!!!!!!!	Stayed their for 7 days on a package deal, standard room is a cracker box if you are over 5ft 6in(told them this was unacceptable, some negotiation, threat of wanting our money back finally got us an upgrade) if you want to use the pool you have to go down stairs, through the casino, across freemont diagonally to binions, through their casino, up the elevator to the roof, reverse this when you are done!! They also make you pay 3 dollars a day to park in their parking, this after almost 700 for the week!! We were in vegas for 2 weeks, tried to make a deal with them for the second, they wanted full price, idiots did not know that i was just giving them their money back, went some where else!!! With about 600 of their money!!! Another thing is that the mustang on the floor has been there for 2 years, you gotta put at least 10 bucks in a machine at the bar to get a comp drink, that's 10 for a 2 dollar beer, pretty far from free!!! And good luck finding a waitress during the week, everywhere on the weekends!!Freemont street is dirty, the vendors are overpriced, better quality stuff and better prices at the outlet malls, the show is old news after the second night, DO NOT take your lady our from under the covered walk way, this is the very old vegas, the least that will happen is that you will be pan handled to death!!! Its not a nice place!!! We actually want to thank 4q's for their lousy service and room, was never asked once how our stay was by the staff (could see the mold painted over in the bathrooms) and had to damn near fight the maid for a few extra coffee packs for the room!!! Forced us to shop around for the second week, found these beautiful extended stay facilities for a third the price, full kitchens, microwaves, full amenities, to include laundry rooms, (find that in a casino hotel) we are talking about 250 to 350 for a week (7days) real t.v. channels &amp; HBO so you could actually lay around and watch the game on sun or sat!! These places are all over vegas!! check it out!!!!	
Sep 28 2009	Hardly any rooms are non-smoking.	Even if they say it is non smoking you have to go into the room and check it out. I talked to the front desk (very nice and wanting to be helpful) when I quadruple checked that the room was a non-smoking one. I was told that 4 times. But we got into the room all the windows were open and it stank to high heaven. We talked to the house cleaning help and they classified it as a smoking room but she said that even if a room is non-smoking they have no way to stop the next person from smoking in it. So we ran to all the rooms to find one we could sit in and not gasp for breath. We were even offered a suite but the other bed was a couch pull out and very uncomfortable. We finally found a person in our group that had two beds that didn't stink to high heaven and we traded with them and then went to the front desk to get things changed and new keys for us. The next thing was equally a mess and that is there were no electrical outlets near the head of the beds. First I tried to plug in my computer and then my cpap. The front desk said they did not have any extension cords for me to use. By this time I was tired and did not want to get dressed and go argue with someone to get one. I was exhausted and we went to sleep with out it. My roommate had to find a new room the next morning. I had forgotten how the cpap was needed to stop my snoring. I loved the casino and ambience of the old style and the easy accesss to the fremont light shows at night. It was excellent. The first show was Bad to the Bone, next was American Pie, then Queen, We will Rock you and it ended with Kiss I left since I was not that familiar with Kiss to stay. I know This ages me but I earned my age and the first three satified my entertainment for that night. I was not able to do very well in the casino and I thought it was too crowded but I won on the slots at the Wynn. Everyone seems to give you a free $10.00 to start with for signing up and the Deuces Wild was fun for almost 3 hours. I even won $60.00. From the strip the bus is $3.00 one way and when I come back I am going to get a bus pass (good for 24 hours) and get on the bus the very first day. On my way back everybody was going to the Fremont light show which is across the mall walkway from the Four Queens. Good luck and have a good trip with an extension cord and talking to the front desk until you find a room that smells good. Oh I almost forgot they do offer to send someone to spray the room but that only is topical since the cigarette smoke is embedded into the room. You would probably have to have it sprayed at least every day. Oh and I didn't know that you had to pay for the wi-fi internet. I had made sure that it was available but no one mentioned the cost. Also the pool is not on the premises you have access to one across the street. But all of this won't keep me from visiting again. I'll just be more prepared next time.	
Sep 16 2009	Great hotel for the money	My brother and I travel to LV once a year. We usually stay on the strip, but this year decided to stay DT. Got a great deal at the 4 Queens, and with TA reviews backing it up, I booked our 3 nights there. The whole DT experience was great for us. The hotel, while older, was clean, the beds very comfortable, the casino was fun, Magnolia's had great food, and the central location could not be beat. Our room was on the 6th floor, so I was a bit concerned about noise, but it was very quiet, down to not even hearing our neighbors come and go. Going forward, we will make DT, and the 4 Queens, our base for future trips. We sleep and shower in our rooms, so having a clean room, with great hot water pressure, worked for us. Add to that the great rate we got, we couldn't have been happier. Both of us agreed this was the most relaxing trip to Vegas we have had in all our years of going.	
Sep 14 2009 	Super Bargain	Spent the Labor Day weekend at the Four Queens and was completely satisfied. Starting with Ruby and the front desk personnel, all employees were friendly and helpful. The room overlooked the Fremont Street Experience and was one of my favorites in nineteen years of visiting Las Vegas. It was clean with a very good bed, and had obviously been recently renovated. The casino was busy and a lot of fun, and the food at Chicago Brewing and the Deli was excellent, as was the service. The sports book was one of the friendliest and most professional I have experienced in Las Vegas, so thanks very much to Stephanie and her crew. Security, housekeeping, and the parking garage checkout guy were all positive and friendly. The Four Queens is a super bargain for the money and I will make it my hotel of choice when visiting Las Vegas.	
Sep 10 2009 	Fine place to stay in downtown Vegas	My husband and I (early 40's) stayed for one Saturday night over Labor Day weekend as an extension to staying the next three days comped in a 5-star hotel on the strip. We had never been to Las vegas before, and wanted to see what downtown was like, in addition to having a decent room rate for the extra night. We chose the 4 Queens based on the room rates and the reviews we'd read on Trip Advisor.The hotel was just as advertised. We really had no major complaints. It is obviously an old building, but everything was in good repair. We had a 17th floor view in the north tower. We did not hear much noise from the canopy below from up there. The shows and free conncerts were great.The casino was of a reasonable size and had a good variety of slots and table games. Drink service was slow at first, but picked up once I kept tipping and made a point of searching out my cocktail waitress and telling her she was a bit hard to track down. She said they had been so slow all summer and then all of a sudden there was so much business they couldn't keep up. I believed her. They really didn't have enough servers for the number of folks playing in the casino.The front desk was friendly and efficient. we checked in at 1:00, so our room was not ready yet.We ate at Magnolias for breakfast which was good, reasonably priced and fast.The room had a coffee maker and an updated TV set. The bathroom is very small, but the hot water was VERY hot! We were pleasantly surprised by that. The bed was comfy.Like I said, no real complaints. This is not a 5 star place, nor does it advertise to be. You get what you pay for, we got our $48 worth.	
Sep 8 2009 	Absolutely amazing deal. Price dropped prior to trip I called they gave me the room at the reduced rate.	The Fremont street experince was right outside the door and it was marvelous. An awesome tribute to the summer of 1969, the light show and free concerts were great.	
Sep 7 2009 	Nice Stay after rough start	We visitied the Four Queens Casino from Aug 16-21 on a great deal found on Expedia - $18 per night. Our stay got off to a bit of a rough start as I had never been to this hotel / casino before and had difficulty finding the valet parking due to all the construction. The Valet parking is actually on a side street (2nd street I think) which ends behind the bandshell which is between the four queens and the fitz. I entered through the wrong street and ended up going into the wrong way into valet exit through the parking garage entrance - poorly marked but eventually I got things straigthened out with the slightly annoyed valet staff. (The valet here was difficult at the best of time - seemed to be understaffed or not anyone around with the separate valet drop off and pickup areas) Parking at the 4 Queens is $3 per night - but if you have a players card (which I had and anyone can get for free - the remove it from your bill). Once I had the in / out procedure down few problems (other then lack of staff with parking my rental car).The check in was a breeze - less then 2 minutes, polite efficient check in staff. We came in late and the casino was busy - again we had not stayed here before so found trip to eleveator the first time (across the casino) a little confusing. We had a nice room on the17th floor with a view towards stratosphere and strip. Our friends had a room overlooking Fremont street on 4th floor which was a nicer view but much nosier at night.Our room was clean and an excellent value for $18 per night. It included a flat screen TV with some channels, nice king size bed and adequate (if small) clean washroom.We enjoyed the casino and M restaurant - with an excellent Prime Rib special for only $9.99 (less with our players card and 2 for 1).Unfortunately no pool, but access to a surprisingly nice, quet pool on the roof of Binions (both hotels now owned by same group)I liked the hotel - we stayed a few nights on the strip as well and am starting to prefer the downtown atmosphere. We walked to many places easily (Fremont, Golden Nuggett, California, Main Street Station, El Cortez and others) and never felt the heat of the walks on the strip or the length. When on strip we are always driving and can never have more then a few drinks. Downtown, easily walked and less pressure if drinking a little too much.I highly recommend this hotel - we stayed at Fremont last year and would not hesitate to stay at either one again in the future.	
Sep 7 2009	Totally Unexpected	This was my first time staying on Freemont Street. The hotel was renovated about 2 years ago. We requested a room not facing Freemont Street since we heard it could be noisy. The room was small but beautifully furnished and the bathroom was very modern. I loved the shower head and took a picture to show my husband so he could replace our old one. Even though we were not facing Freemont street, we could still hear The Freemont Street Experience echoing but we were so tired, we feel asleep anyway. If you want something different than staying on the Strip, go to the Four Queens.	
Sep 7 2009 	Security Issues !	Left wife in hotel room alone, was not a good idea. Ex-tenant was trying togain access to my room and my wife didnt open the door but asked what they wanted. They said they left something behind in the bathroom tissue box. My wife was frieghtened and notified security and the intuders left before security got there. When I returned I was curious to see what was left in the tissue box and found a crack pipe inside. I would have thought security would of check it out but they did nothing. I brought the aritcles to the front desk and my wife was frightened to stay and sleep there. There is no security staff watching the elevators so be prepared to see strangers lurking about in the hoel corridors.	
Sep 2 2009 	Loved our stay at the 4Queens	We stayed for 4 nights and had a very good experience. Arrived at noon and we got checked into our room right away. We were on the top floor of the south tower. The room was very clean, the beds were soo comfy. The food at Magnolias was good (we used 2-4-1's the 3 times we ate there) Had late breakfast twice (the french toast was yummy) and the prime rib special ($9.95) which came with salad, baked potato, vegies, and roll. Won $116.00 on the $10 free slot play for joining the slot club. The only &quot;big &quot; win for me.Great location, lots of slots to play, fun time and good cocktail service One complaint - yes, the bathrooms are small, not much they can do about that, but the shower head was really small and old. Replacing them would help the &quot;old&quot; bathroom setup.We would definitely stay there again and recommend for anyone looking to stay downtown.	
Aug 31 2009 	Not bad for the price	I go to Las Vegas once a year and usually stay Downtown because I can get better value. I picked Four Queens after I found a rate on their website for $23/night. I arrived at the hotel before 3pm but had no trouble getting checekd in. My room was on the 15th floor I was directly over the canopy for the Fremont Experience. 4Q is an older hotel with older customers but for what I paid I was pleasntly surprised with the room. Better than what I had paid $200 for in NYC. The bathroom was small and I didnt like manuvering around the door to get in the tub. But the shower was fine and I had no issues like others have described.There was a flat screen TV but the reception wasnt all that great and it wasn a true HD picture and had the standard choice although somewhat limited I thought. ALso had a coffee maker. I was able to get a small refridgerator for my medicationMy only real complaint was I could hear the bands from Fremont St but that quited down after midnight.Be careful later at night. The hookers are a little more aggresive than I remember from previous trips, I was by myself and the girls continuosly approached me when I just wanted to have a beer at the bar.But for $23 you cant beat it. Sort of a pain to get to the Strip on the bus. It took 45 minutes to get to Caesars.Also be careful if you use a debit card for check in. They'll swipe your card and that ties up funds you may need.	
Aug 29 2009 	Had a great time and will be back for sure!	We are frequent travelers to the las vegas area, sharing our time between the strip and the fremont street experience. Being this was our 3rd time just this year I had come across a really great deal through southwest airlines for airfare and travel for about $450 TOTAL and could not pass it up. We usually stay at Fitzgeralds, the plaza and the vegas club, and we are always saying that we need to venture out and stay somewhere else....we were SO IMPRESSED with the 4 queens!!! we stayed on the 19th floor and our room yet very small, was very clean and tidy with a nice 42 inch TV. the front desk staff was very friendly as well as the bell desk. had just a few complaints, and i dont even know if this counts, but the elevator didnt work in the parking garage so when we got there we had to lug our suitcase on the street to get to the hotel, i did mention this when we checked in and they were aware and had someone working on ut. the tub had a really really slow drain. oh and you had to pay a $6 fee for parking in the garage, i told her that i thought it was stupid and she didnt really seem to care....but that was it! other than that i would highly recommend this place....the sign up for the players club was a good one, you got free play and a 2 4 1 in there cafe there called magnolias. great for 4th meal aka drunk feast!	
Aug 26 2009 	Be Afraid...Be Very Afraid	It's not so much the Four Queens itself - although, there are service issues and a casino that is less than desirable. The main issue is the location that is situated in a seedy area where my husband was accosted by &quot;sex workers&quot; and vagrants. An overall sub-par environment.	
Aug 23 2009 	I had a great time!	The room cost only $115 for four weekdays. The room was clean, comfortable, and quiet. The location is very convenient to the Greyhound bus depot, the Downtown Transportation Center, and the Walgreens. I took the Deuce bus to the Las Vegas Outlet and to Planet Hollywood ffrom Las Vegas Blvd and Fremont. Thc Mirandas coffee shop overlooks the Casino floor. It has economical daily specials. I didn't win, but I didn't lose much either.	
Aug 23 2009 	Great value~Stayed many times and will come back	We have stayed here many times and are more than satisfied with the rooms. They are not as big and fancy as some but are clean and comfortable and have a coffee pot which seems to be a luxury in it's self anymore! Everyone in the whole place is friendly and helpful. Location is great within walking distance to many places. The comps are great. However, we were very disappointed in the gambling this trip. I had expected the slots to be tight because of the economy, but they were much worse than I thought they would be so I wasn't able to spend as much time gambling as I love to.	
Aug 22 2009 	Disappointed	I'm not sure what was refurbished in 2007, but our room looked the same as when we visited in 2000.Dark, very small bathroom. We were not impressed. Will stay some where else in the future. Parking is $3 per day	
Aug 15 2009 	Fantastic Experience!!!	This was my first ever trip to Las Vegas and I have to say I am very pleased that we stayed at the Four Queens and on Freemont Street as opposed to being on &quot;The Strip&quot;! The staff we encountered were all very helpful and seemed happy to serve us. When we arrived at the hotel, we gave the desk clerk $20 and asked if there was any possibility of receiving a complimentary upgrade and she gave us a petite suite!! We spent 6 wonderful nights on the 14th floor of the South tower in a room with a king size bed, two sofas and a 32&quot; LCD television for less than $190 including the $20 tip!The room was very clean, spacious, and even had a refrigerator and an in room safe large enough to hold a laptop computer and any other belongings. The bathroom was also spacious and had a long vanity with two sinks. The view from the room overlooked the canopy of Freemont Street, and although we could hear the performances in the evenings, we were able to drown them out watching television. We were only in the room one evening before the performances were over, so the noise really was not an issue. We were in Vegas after all and therefore slept late and stayed out late! Freemont Street is great! It was very nice to be able to walk out onto the street and go from casino to casino without having to worry about traffic or walking in the hot sun during the middle of the day. It was remarkably clean for a large city with so many tourists, we were pleasantly surprised. We found Freemont Street to be much cleaner than &quot;The Strip&quot; from our experience. The food at the hotel was fantastic, as was the service. We also found several buffets in the surrounding casinos that were fantastic, and enjoyed all our meals in the Freemont Street area. The Paradise Buffet was probably our favorite place to eat. We had breakfast, lunch and dinner there during our trip. Most of the restaurants and buffets have really good deals on food. We are blackjack players so we did not play slots except for goofing around a few times. If you are a blackjack player, be sure to ask the pit bosses for complimentary food before leaving the tables because you do not earn comps for food on your cards. Most of the casinos in the Freemont area make you ask for comps and do not offer them on the cards, but a couple do. Also, if you look around the area, you can find casinos that offer 3 to 2 payouts on blackjacks as opposed to the 6 to 5 you find in most of them.There is easy access to &quot;The Strip&quot; via The Deuce (double decker bus) by walking about a block down Freemont to the bus stop. It is only $7 per 24 hour period to ride as much as you like. It took approximately 15 to 20 minutes to get to the strip from the hotel. We spent a day at the strip, went back to the hotel, then returned to the strip that evening to see a show at The Mirage. Freemont Street was more our speed because we did not enjoy the wall to wall people and walking long distances to go between casinos on the strip in 105 degree weather under full sun. The temperature was not that bad, but it dehydrates you quickly so be prepared to take along water.Overall we highly recommend the Four Queens and Freemont Street! We will definitely go there again!!	
Aug 14 2009 	Our New Favorite Downtown Hotel~We Loved It!	My husband and I stayed 4 nights early August. This was our first time staying at the Four Queens. We normally stay at GN, but decided to try somewhere &quot;new&quot;, and we were not disappointed! Check-in on a Thursday morning with no line. We were given a room in the North Tower, 16th floor, with a view of The Strip-perfect! Ruby, the girl at the front desk, was very kind and helpful with any questions we had. The room was fine and recently updated. Others say it is small, but we don't spend a lot of time in the room, so it worked perfectly for us. The room had a digital safe, coffee maker(big plus!), and flat panel tv. Air conditioning worked perfectly throughout our 4 night stay. Clean and comfortable...we were happy with our room! Also, for anybody wondering, there are 2 towers; both sets of elevators are in/very close to the casino...so no long walks. I understand there is no pool, but guests can use the pool across the street at Binion's.We also found the gambling to be the best here, as well. We both play slots/video poker, and also played some Let It Ride. Cocktail service was great, as well as friendly bartenders at the bars. Tip them well...those guys/gals work hard!There was only one small disappointment, which does not reflect on the hotel itself or the hotel/casino staff. We went to breakfast Saturday morning at Magnolia's. We were seated right away. We were brought coffee rather quickly. 25 minutes later, we are still waiting for someone to take our order. It was crowded, but not completely full, by any means. We waited 5 more minutes, and decided 30 minutes was more than enough, and we left. I can't comment on the food, as we never had any, and decided not to go back for the rest of the trip. It seemed to us the staff was rather unorganized. Servers taking orders, and also cleaning tables; seemed a bit odd. Maybe we caught them on an off day, I don't know.Our 4 day stay at the Four Queens was an overall wonderful experience, and we will be booking with them again on our next trip without hesitation! Thanks for reading!	
Aug 8 2009 	RUDE PEOPLE AND A SCAM TO SEE SHOW	My family and I went to have a nice dinner and the server and hostest were VERY rude.I was VERY embarassed for my family.Then we had (free) tickets to a comdy show that turned out NOT to be free.They SCAM you on the drinks,and they were Rude to my family and myself.Over half the audiance walked out in the middle of the show.It was a horrible show and experiance.	
Aug 3 2009 	What a deal!	I stayed at the Four Queens after doing research on Tripadvisor. My husand and I took a long weekend trip to celebrate our 10th anniversary, wished it was longer. I have absolutely no complaints about the Four Queens. All the staff we encountered were very friendly. We had free breakfast every morning at Magnolia's, basic but good (liked the sourdough toast). I received a buy one get one free dinner, since it was my birthday through the player's club. We both ordered the NY strip dinners at Magnolia's and thought they were pretty good. I had a $20 voucher for slot playing, so I did a little gambling (not a big gambler), won a few bucks. Within a few minutes of sitting at a slot machine a cocktail waitress was there offering drinks each time. The room is small but very comfortable, great air conditioning and shower, and clean. I went back to my room while it was being cleaned to change into tennis shoes after walking a bit (I think we walked ten miles that morning just checking the sites on the strip) and the cleaning lady was very nice, but requested I use my key to get into my room, very good to know your belongings are secure. I gave her a two dollar tip and asked for more coffee, and she was extremely appreciative. We came back later that night and had a surplus of coffee, shampoo, soap, and towels. I have stayed at Bally's, Harrah's, and MGM in the past. I paid significantly more for the room, they are all fine, but I enjoyed my time at the Four Queens more. More bang for significantly less buck.	
Jul 29 2009 	Nice clean 	The room was perfect for one person. It was very clean, comfortable and quiet. More than one person would have been a little crowded. The bathroom was small. The people at the front desk and throughout the Casino were very friendly. My only negative experience was in Magnolia's Restaurant. The service was fast, but the servers and hostess were unfriendly and seemed angry. There were two servers arguing with each other while I was eating breakfast. The food was average but reasonably priced. I would stay there again, just eat somewhere else.	
Jul 29 2009 	Good Value - I Would Stay There Again	We arrived around 1pm on Saturday. There was no line at Registration. We were able to check-in, though the official check-in time is 4pm. The staff was friendly and helpful, explaining the free parking pass system for guests.The room was nice for the price. It was a renovated room. We had a king sized bed, flat screen TV, iron and ironing board, hair dryer, clock radio, AC, and room safe large enough for a laptop. There were two nightstands, a combo dresser/TV stand, small desk for the coffee maker, a larger desk, and an ottoman. Also, lots of hangers in the closet instead of the usual 4-6. The bathroom was small, but the water pressure was good.The only complaint we had was that our non-smoking room came with ash trays and had a really strong smoke smell. We have experienced this before in other downtown hotels, so we weren't really surprised. The downtown hotels are so old that the smoke from all the previous years have permeated everything OR the non-smoking room is really just any room and the guests can choose to smoke or not OR they put us on the first/best available room. Bringing an Airwick or Plug-In Air Freshener would easily remedy this.Subway and Roman Noble (or Noble Roman) Pizza is open until 3am. DO NOT EAT at the hotel cafe Magnolia's. The French Dip was awful, the meat was super dry. The grilled chicken breast was bland as well. The fries were soggy. Since the hotel is on Fremont St., I would recommend Tony Roma's across the way or one of the many restaurants/bars on the street or in the other casinos.Overall, the service was good and friendly. The location is great. You can walk the 3-4 blocks of Fremont (West) and experience numerous casinos, restaurants and bars. The Fremont Experience light and music show was hit and miss. I loved KISS, but was unimpressed by the 60s themed show. The show runs for 20 min at the top of every hour from 8pm-12am. It's loud enough that you can hear it in the room, but it didn't bother us.The room was a good value for the price, and we would stay there again.	
Jul 23 2009 	Fun time on Fremont!	We felt comfortable staying here, after reading all the positive reviews &amp; they were all right! I noticed nothing negative during our stay. We stayed on the strip for a week last November at a much pricier place and had much more fun on this stay...we certainly didn't miss having to drive or take cabs anywhere, nor being packed like a sardine on The Deuce in stifling heat! We liked the smaller scope of the 4 Queens and appreciated not walking for miles &amp; getting lost in the casino. The rooms were just fine, comfy bed, clean, good maid service, no noise issues. Upon check-in (which took all of 3 or 4 minutes, same with checkout) we were given coupons for free breakfasts in the hotel restaurant for all the mornings we were there. An older demographic seems to be the norm at the Fremont hotels, leading to a much more relaxed pace than on the strip, which we found very pleasant....and you know what? I thought of one negative, there aren't ice machines on every floor...but, that was something we could live with.	
Jul 20 2009 	Looking for value and comfort? Look no further	If you are after a place to stay that is clean comfortable and has friendly staff then the 4 Queens is the place for you. Ok its downtown in &quot;Old Style Vegas&quot; but there is still a lot to do in the area. And if you want to commute to the strip the bus ($3) is only a block away or a cab costs just $10 (make sure the cabbie goes straight down Vegas Blvd not out on the highway or its gonna come to $18 - $20). The value is outstanding having stayed there for 17 nights for a total of $540 in June/July, room service came every single day, the rooms are very clean and the air conditioning is excellent. Put it this way, who spends that much time in their room whilst in Vegas anyway? The service is fantastic, just pick up the phone and they are there with whatever you need in just a few minutes. The store downstairs is great for convenience and there is a walgreens (supermarket) just one block away. One of the highlights downtown is the Fremont Street Experience. Live music every night, festivals on the weekend and the unbelievable light show makes it truly one of a kind. The restaurants in the area are very good and great value. Magnolias and the Chicago Brewing Co at the 4 Queens are both great. Binions has the best cheeseburgers in the area and hennesys does really good homestyle meals at great prices. The best buffet by far is at the Golden Nugget with a great variety including asian and seafood. As for the casino's themselves they cant match the huge buildings on the strip but they are fun and functional and the limits are low with games such as 50c roulette, $2 blackjack and $3 craps. I stayed in the north tower which seems to be a bit newer than the other one. Checking in is easy and quick and there is no problem checking in early or out late provided the rooms aren't required immediately. Overall i would say if you need a place to stay that is comfortable and great value for money you cannot go past the 4 Queens. Most people go to Vegas to gamble or to do tours of the landmarks, so save your money for these things.	
Jul 16 2009 	Not too shabby but never again	We got to the hotel and parked in the garage but had to take the elevator down to street level, then round the corner and walk outside toward the front valet area to get inside the hotel. (not convenient) Yes we met with a woman who did not want to be there, lousy attitude and some other lady just stood there with a look that could kill on her face. Bell hops were kind. Got to the room 2 beds, one lamp that hangs on the wall did not work. The lamp in the corner did not work. The cable outlet was hanging out of the wall with a brown extension cord dangling around it. No water pressure in the shower. I read a note on the back of the bathroom door that said &quot;room rates are between $49 and $459..I dont know who would pay that much for that lousy room. We were on the fourth floor and heard the music from the Fremont show until midnight. We ate at the hotel restaurant where the service was fantastic!!! They made up for the front desk! But the whole smell of the hotel was just too much for me. I understand there is the smell or smoke but when we walked into the Golden Nugget, Lady Luck...they did not have that stench. I got home and washed both clean and dirty clothes at least twice to remove the stench. Oh...the workers at the Players Club also look like they dont wanna be there either..which is unfortunate cause I'm sure someone who lost their job due to the bad economy would love to do their duties and will do with a smile on their face!!! Just poor customer service...but I figured they all felt ill cause of the smell. One last comment..please be careful!! I was in the hotels restroom and as I was washing my hands, saw a lady walk in and use the 2nd sink next to me and began to wash her lower private areas. Literally lifter her dress and cleansed herself!!!! I was appalled!!! Come to find out she was a prostitute...we saw her later in the week with different men. So sad and disturbing. So if I weigh pros and cons...I would not recommend this hotel at all!!!	
Jul 14 2009 	Nothing fancy but worth the money	My girl friend and I stayed here for 2 nights from Jun 17 - 19. It locates 5 mins walk from the deuce bus stop and most of the hotels at downtown. The room itself is okay, but very small washroom, services are pretty good. However, when booking, try to request an upper level room because we stayed on 9th floor and we had no view (blocked by the neon light screen) and we heard the sound of the neon show from 7p-midnight and it sometimes gets annoying.	
Jul 13 2009 	Amazing Stay!	I stayed from July 5th to 10th at the Four Queens. It was myself (36), brother (41) and mother (70) that went. We had two rooms in the North Tower (Quieter of the two). The rooms were very clean and the beds were very comfortable. The hotel is very quiet - it tends to have an older clientele staying there.I really like staying at the Four Queens because of how liberal they are with their comps. I had a flight leaving at 11:30 pm and was able to get one room extended to that time free of charge. As well , the hotel gave us a completely free meal for the four of us on the last night in Magnolia's Veranda - including alcohol!I found the staff to be extremely friendly and accomodating. I love downtown as I feel the deals are much better than the strip - including table minimums, food, and accomodations. I would definitely recommend the Four Queens to anyone!	
Jul 13 2009 	Excellent Stay	Second stay at Four Queens--it will not be my last. Outstanding customer service. (One snippy person the whole week all over the city, and it happened to be the players' club redemption lady who waited on me!) Clean, comfortable hotel. I like the fact that Four Queens has coffeemakers in the rooms. I had not tried Binion's pool before this trip, and I liked it. Four Queens doesn't have a pool, so they have made arrangements to use Binion's. It is a small pool, but not at all crowded, and it really wasn't too much of a hassle to walk across the street--it's still less walking than one would have to do at any Strip hotel. As always, Magnolia's food was excellent. Slots were good. Drink service was good. The service everywhere in Las Vegas was excellent this trip--I think the economy has changed some attitudes. Anyway, book the Four Queens with confidence that you will have a nice stay.	
Jul 12 2009 	Best comedians in Las Vegas	Having seen 4 other comedy acts in Las Vegas, the one at Four Queens was way better--they related to the audience, were incredibly funny, and if you don't think so, there's free drinks. Plus had a great spaghetti dinner for only $6.	
Jul 12 2009 	Wonderful!	We recently stayed 5 nights at the 4 Queens in one of the North Tower rooms. Check-in was fast and friendly. They allowed us to check-in much earlier than the 3:00 check in time. The room had clean, soft linens, soft pillows, and a wonderful bed. The bathroom was small, but clean. All of the staff was really nice throughout our stay. They brought extra towels to the room when needed. We ate at Magnolia with the 2 for 1 offer quite a few times. The food was always great and the service in the restaurant was great. The hotel was easily accessible to the Deuce Bus and the bus routes to and from the airport. For the price, you just can't beat it!	
Jul 8 2009 	Accessible few frills	My wife and I had never stayed in the Fremont area and the Four Queens was offering low prices compared to other name hotels....so we made reservations for 3 nights. We rented a car, a necessity actually to get downtown. When I heard in the elevator that someone had paid $40 for a taxi ride from the airport I felt much better about the car rental. It was easy to get into the hotel parking structure but getting from there into the hotel was a little annoying. The room, on the fourth floor, was plain but clean. The smoke alarm went off after showering, something we had to notify the front desk about. The hotel restaurant was average. No pool, though we had access to the rooftop pool at the Binions. That pool, however, was small and surrounded by concrete. No exercise room either to balance all the eating. We did enjoy watching the light show and seeing the artisans, and there were bands playing from time to time right outside. We walked around the area for a couple of hours. After that we found ourselves driving to the casinos on the strip and fighting the traffic. Next time we will return to a big name casino with a big pool and probably avoid the car rental and traffic. Once at the Four Queens was enough.	
Jul 8 2009 	Good but Not Great	I first arrived to be greeted by a front desk clerk that didn't seem to happy to be there. (I never understood how people in a Customer Service occupation could have such a terrible attitude towards customers) Anyways, the room was clean, bathroom small, but good for the price I guess. I was disappointed that I did not get what I asked for...I asked for a Non-smoking room and specified in the special instructions section to please make sure there was no smoke smell. Unfortunately, as soon as I walked in the room smelled like smoke! Mostly in the bathroom. Overall it was good for the price, but I don't think I'd go back because of the smoky room. I would recommend it to people who don't mind smoke and just needs a room to sleep in.	
Jun 23 2009 	Who needs the Strip when everything is close by when staying Downtown!	My 5 night stay at the 4 Queens was GREAT. The room wasn't huge but it was more than adequate for my Wife and I. Room was very quiet, we had people beside us but we never heard any noise from them. Now if you are an early sleeper, I would suggest somewhere else because the Freemont experience is plenty loud 'til around 12:30 A. M. I wouldn't recommend the 4 Queens restaurants, the waitress was friendly but the other staff weren't friendly at all. Food was so so, price was fair with the 2 for 1 specials. Hotel was easy to commute to from airport and to Strip, but honestly who needs the Strip when you have it all right outside your door on Freemont St. Great stay for the price 4-1/2 stars for the overall package.	
Jun 21 2009 	Great location - great price - and our favorite dealer!	I can't believe that I forgot to review the Four Queens after our stay there last September.The wife and I traveled to LV for our wedding anniversary, and we knew we wanted to stay downtown. After searching TripAdvisor, we had decided on the Golden Nugget, but they didn't have a room available for the full length of our stay. We then opted to book at the Four Queens, and am I ever glad we did.We arrived after getting our rental acr at the airport, and the valet took care of our bags and parked our car. Check in was a breeze, but we got a bit lost finding our room. We booked a room in the tower closest to Fremont Street, so you have to walk through the casino to get to the elevators for that tower. The path wasn't marked very well, but we managed to run into someone who pointed the way. After you find the elevators the first time, they're very easy to find.We got up to our room, and I placed the night lock in the opening to hold the door open for the valet. A knock at the door a few minutes later was from Security, who was wlking the hallway and saw the open door so he checked to make sure everything was OK in the room. The valet arrived a few minutes later, and also knocked and waited until I opned the door to come in.As others have said, the rooms are not huge, but there's plenty to do that you don't need to spend a lot of time in the room. I would have liked a bigger chair to sit in, but I understand why there isn't one, and I could live without it. The bathroom could have been bigger for me, but once again, they have to work with the footprint of an old hotel building, so they have to make do with the size of the bathroom. We called and asked for extra towels and pillows, and they arrived within ten minutes without any issues at all. Rooms were taken care of every day, sometimes within an hour of us leaving the room in the morning.We enjoyed playing at many of the downtown hotels, but the El Cortez and the Four Queens were our two favorites. The El Cortez is just down from the Fremont Street Experience, which is where we found the lowest table game limits. But I had a blast playing at the Four Queens. The look of the casino is classic, a Victorian-like decor. A dealer taught me how to play Pai Gow Poker, which I had never understood before, and I became addicted to it. I also enjoy playing Blackjack and Roulette, and played those as well. A dealer named Junie was a pleasure to be with. I lost $100 at her table one night and walked away laughing and happy. She seems to want you to enjoy your game, and was just a great personality. We will definitely look for her specifically when we return.We used the rental car several days, decided to get away from the downtown casino scene for a while. We visited the Red Rock Canyon historic area, a beautiful 13 mile scenic drive through beatuiful scenery. The next day we went to Valley of Fire State Park, and found we didn't have enough time to see all of the park. This place was absolutely amazing, being an arm's length away from 4000 year-old indian petroglyphs. I will return to Valley of Fire Park again, it was just stunning.Of course, you can't forget the Fremont Street Experience, a free light show on the canopy that covers six blocks of Fremont Street. I found myself watching my watch and leaving the gaming tables to go see the light shows.I highly recommend the Four Queens. If you go to play, look for Junie ... you'll have a blast!	
Jun 19 2009 	You get what you paid for	Most of the employees were grouchy and looked like they had somewhere better to be than working. I'm sure nobody likes to work but I think that friendliness is part of the job. Security looked like the President of the United States was somewhere near, and most of the employees never looked you in the eye. Maybe I was there during the wrong week, I'm not sure. I stayed at the Wynn Hotel in October of 08 and most of the employees treated me royally. Even the Security guards posted next to the elevator was cordial with me after a few days of seeing me. I will never stay at the Four Queens Hotel again. There are just too many hotels in Vegas to choose from, I guess you get what you paid for.Q	
Jun 19 2009 	4 queens was a very poor choice	We did get a good rate but the room was very small. There was not enough room for a regular chair it only had a writing table and wood chair. The room was in the north tower and the bathroom was so small that you had to sit on the toilet to shut the door. The carpet was worn and it had come unraveled at the bathroom and about 1/2 to 1 inch there was nothing except subfloor.The room was so bad that my wife would not stay in it. I know that none of us go to here for the rooms - we are out playing most of the day but you can't stay in some place this bad....We asked to upgrade and we could only go to a suite with about 4x as much as we paid of the original room plus we had to pay for parking that was not mentioned when booking.I will never book at this hotel again.	
Jun 16 2009 	could be the best for the price - $29 per night	I went to sleep in the car one day while a friend was driving and when I awakened I noticed that we were actually on the way to Las Vegas. Without plans or reservations, I decided to find the cheapest possible room, hearing about a $13 per night room at Buffalo Bill's. I can't say that I'd like to stay that far from town, but I thought something a little closer and pricier would be great. After I reached 411 to see about locating cheap rooms, I was transferred to 866-vegasnow (or 800 or 877?). The operator gave me several choices and the best one was the Four Queens in downtown. For only $29 per night, I couldn't lose out. The room: was a bit dusty and did not have a view.The casino: was just like all the others.The restaurant: was like a Dennys! (bad or good, depending on what you get)The bar: was - I don't remember.Bottom line: It was cheap and the reservation was on the spot and near the downtown street that was renovated with a nighttime light show. If you are spending $100+ per night, find deals at the strip. Otherwise, go with &quot;the fabulous Four Queens&quot;!	
Jun 15 2009 	everyone talking about charge for parking	When you check into the 4 Queens, if you tell the front desk you will be using their parking garage, there will be no charge for parking.They give you a &quot;sign&quot; to put on your dash &amp; when you go to leave the garage the parking attendant will see the &quot;sign&quot; and have you fill out a small piece of paper.The use this for records &amp; there is no charge to your room for parking.We stayed for almost 1 week. Without exaggerating we probably left the parking garage 20-30 times over our stay &amp; never had a charge for it.If you are not staying at the hotel or do not tell them when you check in that you will be parking a car, there is a $3 charge for the garage.	
Jun 13 2009 	the best	WHEN WE GOT TO THE FOUR QUENNS evry body was nice the romms was nice and cosy and comftoble they had lots of restaurants soy yo u play and star there you do not ned leve the hotel or casino for nothing	
Jun 13 2009 	Great value and location	We have stayed at the Four Queens the last few times we went to Las Vegas and we love it there! The rooms are comfortable and clean and we love the soft pillows, views from the room, and flat screen TV's. The hotel is in the perfect location downtown with convenience to all the other downtown casinos, shopping, and dining. We enjoy that the canopy keeps the heat off of us during the day. I have had good luck at the 4Q every time we go there! I really like trying to win the keepsake coins on the &quot;Silver Strike&quot; slot machines. The Four Queens is perfect for anyone who enjoys the convenience of downtown and is a great value for the money. I recommend the Four Queens to anyone who is looking for a comfortable, clean hotel in a great location!	
Jun 6 2009 	Great time - great value	This is my 4th time in vegas; 1st time staying downtown. I regret not staying downtown earlier. The convenience is nice..down the elevator and 10 strides you're outside on freemont street! There are 5 casinos within a few feet. We stayed for $20/ night including taxes - booked at vegas.com. The parking was $3/ day with unlimited vallet. The environment is really relaxed and down to earth. The cleaning lady was wonderful - she took great care of us. All employees helpful/ courteous. You can use the pool at Binions with the Four Queens room key. The elevator is near the Poker room and is on the 25th floor and open til 7:30PM. Great place to relax!Watch out for the scary people wandering around freemont street after 1AM, and the check-in people are a bit cranky. The wait staff are slow to bring drinks - even if tipping well. The wifi is about $10/ 24 hours and slow.	
Jun 6 2009 	Great Value for the Money	While the structure is Old Vegas, the rooms have been updated and upgraded and are very comfortable, and very clean. The Fremont Street location allows you to get out and walk to other casinos/hotels, restaurants, gift shops, a multi-screen theatre, etc. If you don't want to have to drive everywhere, this is a plus. And the Strip is only eight minutes away by car. Currently, the Four Queens adds on a small parking fee ($3 per day), if you use their parking garage. While other casinos/hotels on Fremont offer free parking, I didn't mind this small additional fee, since the room was so comfortable. We also had very hot water in the bathroom, something that seems to be inconsistent among some of the older hotels there on Fremont St. That alone was worth the $3.We liked it well enough that we're booking another four nights there, versus other hotels with slightly lower daily rates. I would recommend the Four Queens to anyone, without hesitation or reservation.	
Jun 3 2009 	Great Place to stay	We have been going to Las Vegas now for a couple times a year since 1997 and have been staying at the Four Queens in old Vegas. The rooms are clean, the casino is clean &amp; fun, the staff are very attentive and remember us from visit to visit. Everyone is helpful if you have questions or need anything. House keeping had our room made up so quickly each day we could hardly get to breakfast and back. That was great. The food in all of the restaurants, was really good &amp; plentiful, reasonably priced and the staff you could just not ask for better service. The whole Freemont Street Experience is something we look forward to each time we go. Nostalgia at it's best. You can just feel the greats from the past, so much history. We have recommended to all our friends and family who have most all either been or are going and will stay here.	
Jun 1 2009 	Poor Front Check-in Service	Customers first impression is front desk usually, besides valet perhaps. I must say this hotel did a poor job! I was quite surprised since their overall rating was a 4.2! The first thing the elder lady with glasses said was ,'Last Name'? No smile..no welcoming feeling at all. I'm not sure if these people are trained in customer service at all, but front desk should be providing the best possibly at all times since they are the first ones to interact with customers.Secondly, on the website, parking is written everywhere that it is free. Think again, if you are driving/rented a car, parking is $3/night. I wanted a receipt indicating that I paid $3/night for parking, and she could not give me one. She merely told me that you can't get out of the parking lot without this yellow pass permit or I could pay the max rate. Next time, I would advise that this hotel should inform everyone the accuracy of what they should expect before catching customers off-guard in having to pay and not have it written everywhere it's 'complimentary'.	
May 26 2009 	Great value close to everything	Great hotel for the price, I stay there for 3 nights, the room on my first night has a bad thermostat (I think), I have a cold night, then I change to a different room, which is a smoking room but did not have any odor. It is very easy to access casino, food, snake, fremont experience, etc. A little far (especially in long weekend the traffic is terrible) from strip. And kind of surprise there is no swimming pool in this hotel, I have to goto Binion top floor to use their small swimming pool, a little disappoint for kids. The wind blowing at the roof make the swimming pool extra cold and walking on the street with swimming gear &amp; trunk make me embarrassing. Food is cheap &amp; good in downtown, and no need to take 10min to find a parking &amp; walk 15min from parking to casino like the big hotel in the strip.	
May 21 2009 	Nice Stay at the Four Queens	Just got home from a 4 night stay at the Four Queens Hotel And Casino. This was the first time I have stayed downtown in Las Vegas. The hotel is older and it shows in a lot of ways, yet it was clean, housekeeping was very good, I always had hot water for showers, the bed was comfortable, and there was a coffeemaker in the room. My room was on the tenth floor on the Fremont street side of the building so it was very noisy in the evenings until the last Fremont Street Experience show at midnight, but, it still wasn't that bad. The room wasn't huge, but was very adequate for me as a solo traveler. Downtown was a lot different than the strip (for one thing, as others have noted, there are none of the &quot;porn-slappers&quot; downtown). It was very nice to be able to walk short distances between places, instead of girding for the hike to get anywhere downtown. As a person alone, with no set itinerary, I had no problem getting from downtown to the strip using the Sam's Town shuttle. It has two stops downtown, then goes directly to Sam's Town. From Sam's Town it goes to Harrah's and then Riviera so you have the option of mid strip or north strip. The shuttle was never more than half full and it was all just tourists like myself. It is very prompt and the drivers were always friendly. I would recommend downtown Las Vegas and the Four Queens to anyone looking for a less hectic (and less expensive) alternative to the Strip.	
May 19 2009 	Cool hotel	Located in the city center, the hotel is really cool, a lil' old school but the rooms have space enough and the breakfast is perfect. I would recommend this hotel for the price and the location. The strip is not far away from here. Have fun	
May 18 2009 	clean and friendly	On my trip I traveled alone, and my stay at the Four Queens I felt very safe. The staff was very helpful and friendly. If you are looking for a fun trip to Las Vegas, I would recommend downtown! SO MUCH FUN!	
May 17 2009 	Excellent Place Bargain Price	We booked our holiday through Expedia. As a result, we received a Fun Book (had to ask for it) at the hotel. This book had great 2 for 1 deals in it. We used the deals to eat at Magnolia's and found the portions huge and the food excellent. Everyone we encountered from the front desk to the restaurant to the casino staff were friendly, helpful and always polite. The room we clean and had plenty of room for us and our belongings. Our room was facing Fremont Street and we tend to go to bed early. The only time the noise was loud was Friday night. Even Saturday night wasn't as loud as Friday. We loved being able to go out of the hotel and have free entertainment every night on Fremont Street. We have stayed in downtown Las Vegas before at several different hotels and, for the money, this is the best. For more money, the Golden Nugget is great but we didn't nee the extra luxury of the rooms there since we used the room mostly for sleeping. There is no pool but you can use the one at Binions by just showing your room key. We were told that anyone can use the pool at the Golden Nugget but we did not try it so I don't know if that is accurate. If you don't rent a car and want to go to the Strip the Deuce (bus) is only $5.00 a day, unlimited trips. We rented a car this time and went to Red Rock Canyon, the Grand Canyon, Hoover Dam, Laughlin and Primm. Parking was $3.00 per day at the hotel. Fabulous vacation! Want to go back again and will stay at Four Queens again.	
May 15 2009 	Excellent hotel if you wish to stay away from the strip.	The Four Queens is a very nice hotel. I was with a group that wanted to minimize the walking a bit so Freemont St was a great location as many casinos are a short walk from the hotel. The strip is a short drive from Freemont St if you use I15 at the right time of day. We used the bus one day. That was a mistake as it takes a long time to get to where you are going due to the many stops. The room was a decent size and clean. Parking was $3 a night for hotel guests. The staff was very nice and helpful. The only problem I was with the toilet and it was fixed quickly. My only complaint was with the internet. They charge for wireless at $9.95 per day. It should be free. I got it for two nights, the first day it worked perfectly, but the second day it hardly worked. Just long enough to do airline check in. The casino was small compared to the strip, but it was of sufficient size for me. We ate at the Magnolias several times. Got some 2 for 1s for signing up for the Pro Players card. The food was always good and the service was a little off and on. The worst was at 4:30 in the morning when we had to get to the bowling tournament early. Not sure if it is always a problem that early or we just hit it at a bad time.	
May 12 2009 	Great Place to Stay Downtown	We like to stay downtown. Small hotels/casinos. Less crowds. Better service. Better slots. In any case, typically stay at the Golden Nugget but no rooms available. Decided on the Four Queens based on the reviews here. Happy with our choice. Nice room, nothing fancy, but comfortable. We had a room facing the strip, on the 11th floor. Reasonable view, thought that wasn't particularly important. As others have mentioned, a small bathroom, but not an issue. Just two of us and we could take turns. Service at the front desk and in the restaurant, Magnolias, was very good. We have been big fans of the &quot;loose&quot; slots at the Four Queens for years, and weren't disappointed. Overall, a great stay. Would most likely stay there again. Close to the bus stop (The Deuce) that runs the Strip.	
May 10 2009 	We are about to return for our 5th. stay.	First discovered &quot;4Queens in '05, thanks to an Australian travel show on Tv.We now call it &quot;our second home&quot;, the staff are magnificent and almost like family to us ,being seniors we love the location,downtown has so much to offer and if we feel like venturing further afield,such as &quot;The Strip&quot; or out of town venues the local transport is A1,recommend this propery to anyone. Stan &amp; Merle Munro Perth Western Australia.	
May 7 2009 	Very good hotel!!	The mattress at Four Queens was better than mine at home.. Room clean. I will stay there again. Four Queens please comp me soon with free rooms. This was my second time to stay at the Four Queens. Check in clerk was fast and efficient. Check in clerks help me print my boarding pass the day I left.Staff was very helpful.	
May 5 2009 	Best value in downtown Vegas	Have not stayed at this property for many many years. Pleasantly surprised with the room condition. Staff was always great and this time was no exception. Front desk checkin was quick and really really helpful as we had somehow double booked. No issues or fuss was made and credit given for second booking. Small property means faster everything, from checkin/out, to dining wait times, valet service and even getting onto gaming tables of your choice.Definitely will be at the top of our list for our next visit.	
May 3 2009 	Best rooms best seats best people wonderful trip!	I haven't been to Vegas since 1990, Or honeymoon. This is our 19th Aniversary and boy was I suprised. With all the changes, the people at 4queens and the fremont st. experience was great just like the good old days. Hotel rooms were very nice and well supplied with large flat screen TV, safe and the best bed.(Slept like a rock).hotel staff were quick to assist all our requests. No disappointments here. Food was very tasty, with large portions at a very low price, (Cheeper than home). The game tables were busy and we found all our favorite slots. We played for hours on very little money. We recomend 4 Queens to all travelers to Las Vegas. We will come back very soon. There was just no down side to this Hotel! Thanks 4 Qeens. Jeff. of Kansas	
May 2 2009	Four Queens	Just returned from a four day stay at the Four Queens and were very pleased with the experience. Excellant value.We have been to Vegas many times and prefer to stay downtown.Will definately return to the Four Queens.	
Apr 30 2009 	Great Overall Experience	My wife and I decided to stay downtown instead of on the strip, It was our first time to Vegas together and we thought that all we needed was a base for our stay. What a great choice. The staff at the 4-Queens were very friendly and helpful. Our room was not overly large but it was clean and the king bed was very comfy, the flat screen t.v. was a bonus. We are not high maintenance people so this hotel was perfect for us. Make sure you get the coupon book when you check in, as it has many 2 for 1 deals in it. Also sign up for the players club card as it will also give you some deals on your meals at Magnolias . We ate breakfast,dinner and supper at magnolias on more than one occasion and found the food plentiful and very delicious. It is not a fancy place but worthwhile. The Freemont street experience is worth seeing. There were live bands and street vendors and buskers plying their trade on the street, it was a great experience. We would stay there again. This hotel is not for kids or young couples looking to party all night.	
Apr 30 2009 	Awesome hotel	We arrived on tues the april 7th. Was great service had room on 9th floor not to far from other couple that we were with. Was perfect Room was clean each time the best ask for extra pillow had it right away...Loved being right down on freemont the light show was awesome.... The food in the hotel was very good...... Stayed here for 7 nights . Would definetly stay here again.	
Apr 29 2009 	A delightful surprise when you opened the door.	The room looked like it had just been refurbished. Very comfortable and cozy. Pleasant hotel and staff.	
Apr 22 2009 	Highly Recommended -	We stayed at the 4 Queen's Casino from April 12th - 17th, and would not hesitate to recommend it to others. It is a smaller hotel/casino compared to those on the Strip, so it has a more personal, friendly feel and is in a prime location on Fremont Street. The first room we had overlooked the Fremont Street Experience, but we had problems getting into our rooms with the key cards, so we were upgraded to a larger room on the opposite side of the hotel. The room was spotlessly clean and extremely quiet - we could not have asked for a better location. We had breakfast in Magnolia's restuarant every morning - very inexpensive and good value, and had some evening meals there as well. We got a very good price through Expedia, and if we go back to Vegas, we will definitely stay there again. Fremont Street has a good feel to it; we felt very safe while we were there, and it's just a short ride on the Duece to the Strip.	
Apr 20 2009 	Great value 	My husband &amp; I stayed at the Four Queens from April 10th to April 12th, 2009. Based on Trip Advisor reviews, the location &amp; the price through Expedia, we deceided to give the 4 Queens a chance. We were NOT dissappointed. We got a regular room next to the Fremont Street Experience. Since we were out until after midnight every night, having room next to FSE did not bother us at all.Our experience at the Check-in counter was fast &amp; friendly. We did find out that there is a $3.00 per night charge for the parking garage, but that was fine with us. Not having to find a place to park each night was worth the $3.00 charge. We were given a parking pass to show the garage attendant &amp; remember to keep your little white ticket. You need to give it to the attendant each time you leave the parking garage. Our room was cozy, but very clean. Hotels we have stayed at on the strip were not as clean as our room at Four Queens was. We were pleasantly surpirsed by this. Our bed was comfortable but our door always seemed to slam shut, even when were trying to close it quietly. Once we got into our room, we could not hear people through paper thin walls. We just heard the occassional door slam shut. It was no big deal to us.Something people may want to know about is that in the tower we stayed in, there is not an ice machince on each floor. There was one on ours, but we just found that a little unusual. Our room had a coffee maker, hair dryer &amp; a televison with a decent selection of channels. Who spends much time inside a hotel room in Las Vegas anyway!We really enjoyed our stay at the Four Queens &amp; will stay here again. We did not have a good dining expereince at Magnolia's. Our food was bland &amp; the service was &quot;okay&quot; at best. The slots were fun &amp; payed out pretty well. Our favorite part was the Roulette table. We stopped by there 3 times &amp; each time the person running the table was both helpful &amp; knowledgeable. We enjoyed having everything we could want within walking distance. Walgreens is less than a 5 minute walk away. Four Queens does not have a swimming pool, but we were told at check-in that Binion's lets the guests of Four Queens use their swimming pool. I would not bring my children to this hotel, but it was fine for just the two of us.	
Apr 19 2009 	A fine place to stay	Based on Trip Advisor's recommendation, I stayed for a week in this hotel, and I wasn't disappointed. If you're doing Las Vegas on a budget, this is a great choice. It's not on the strip, but it's is only an easy bus trip away, and the hotel is right in the middle of the Fremont Street experience. I found that the staff were always helpful, and my room was clean and comfortable and quiet (as it was at the back of the hotel, not facing Fremont Street).	
Apr 15 2009 	The staff is friendly and eager to make your stay pleasant	We did not stay here, but came for some late night gambling and then to the sandwich shop the next day for a bite to eat. The little lady making our sandwiches and malts was happy, friendly and very nice and the sandwiches were delicious and cheap! The late night dealers actually seemed to like their jobs and were quite friendly with us. Although we did not win, we will be back, the staff seems to actually like their jobs and the interaction with the people.	
Apr 11 2009 	Four Queens Treated Me Like Royalty	My seventh trip to Vegas was complete with a stay at the Four Queens. I've stayed at the Rio, MGM and the like, and knowing that most hotel rooms differ mostly monetarily as opposed to aesthetically, I chose this hotel simply looking for clean accomodations, and a break from the overcrowded strip. And, I found exactly what I was looking for. After a shuttle drop-off, I arrived for a late check-in (9 pm) and the gentleman at the counter couldn't have been more considerate. When I received my room keys for a suite (an upgrade), I found a clean room with a flat screen tv, large bathroom, and despite it's closeness to the Fremont Experience, I experienced a nice, serene quiet in the midst of the show's performances. The housekeeping staff was very attentive and hospitable, leaving plenty of towels, and even a new bath rug in the room each night.Now, smoking might be an issue for some. If so, you might seek other arrangements. I'm a non-smoker, and the smoke was apparent when I approached the elevators, but fortunately, the smells were limited to the casino area. I didn't get a chance to eat at Hugo's or Magnolia's but heard good things about them both. In the end, Downtown Vegas was all that I needed and more than I expected. I cleaned up on the cash there too (Fitzgerald and Fremont slots, no less), so I am certain to return to FQ. It's a certainty.	
Apr 11 2009 	Great Stay for the Price	I stayed three nights. Knowing the atmosphere on Freemont Street I anticipated the noise at night but it didnt bother me. The windows are thick enough to drown out most of the noise. If you want real quiet, ask for a room that is not facing Freemont Street. For the most part the staff was great. One exception was the restaurant staff. I believe the name was Mongolias. The wait was not the best but the delay also had to do with an irate guest who complained about his discount. I offered to pay the difference of his bill just to get him out of line. The manager and staff handled it well. At times going beyond what is expected when dealing with someone like him. Others in line also offered to pitch in just to get him moving. The only criticism I have is there wasnt enough staff on hand for seating people. But once seated, order and delivery was fast. The hotel is located in the middle of everything if you are like me and dont like the hassle of the main strip. The staff was great all around. Very friendly from check in to check out. The room was nice. Water pressure in the shower was not up to par but other than that no major issues. The hotel does not have a swimming pool so dont pack your trunks. Parking is the easiest around town. Ive stayed at TI, MB, MGM and NY before where parking was/is such a headache. 4Qs has a great valet system and not much waiting if none at all. The best of all is you can walk to everything on Freemont Street and get a better bang for your buck than on the strip or the other BIG hotels.	
Apr 10 2009 	4 Queens the complete affordable package	We stayed 4 days and nights at the Queens. It is so centrally located to everything. If you have handicapped parking it is really great. Don' t make the mistake like we did and try to drag your bags to like a main marked elevator. There are elevators into the casino on both sides in the parking garage, one is just not marked well. Staff was great, if you eat in their restaurant (make sure you have your players card), it will save you $2.00 off the prime rib. They offer it at a certain price but fail to tell you this is with the discount you will get with your players club card, plus you will receive a coupon for a buy 1 get 1. Little sneaky on the food to get the price, but do it, it is worth it. Great hotel, we will stay there again and again. Book your rooms through cheaphotels.com. Our rate was only $29.00 a night (overall) and more than worth that, clean rooms, cleaned every day, and nice attractive rooms. After all who needs to spend all their money on the hotel.	
Apr 8 2009 	best kept secret in Las Vegas awesome place	Just got back after our annual trip to Vegas, the 4 Queens has the best staff in Vegas, helpful, courteous, pleasant. Do have to say our two favorite people at the 4 Queens are Mike Cook and Dante, bartenders, these two are great and a very valuable asset to your hotel.	
Apr 6 2009 	Pass it by	This Hotel failed me in most every way. When I asked them for some kind of compensation for all my trouble, I got NOTHING. Below are the highlights (sometimes paraphrased) of the letter I gave to their director of Operations, Mr Walter Lobeck on 1/12/09 detailing the comedy of errors my stay at the 4 Queens was.Dear Mr Lobeck,I have several issues with the Hotel and the service (or lack thereof) I have received while here. I have been unable to fall asleep or stay asleep for every night I have spent here. I wish to explain why. On Wednesday I checked into room #710. Being on the side of the Hotel near the &quot;Experience&quot; I needed to stay up till midnight, although I wanted to go to sleep two hours earlier. (The experience is the light and sound show that takes place on the hour on the FREMONT ST EXPERIENCE adjacent to the hotel). A lady at the front desk took pity on me and let me switch to room 1211 the following morning. Prior to leaving 710, I took a most unpleasant shower. Seems there is termperature control only on the shower. I was getting pelted by such a strong current (there is no flow control) the shower actually hurt. (two strikes for room 705). The following nights, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday I woke up very early in the morning with a sore throat and covered in sweat. (The room was hot as blazes) On Saturday I realized that dry hot air was blowing in my room early mornings despite the thermostat being set to 50 degrees. Prior to Saturday when I woke the hot air had already turned off. Setting the thermostat to 60 and 55 degrees had not worked. The temperature was closer to 80. Disgusted with the heating system, I called the operator who was kind enough to send &quot;Peter the engineer&quot; to my room. Peter explained to me that this system was originally installed to be used solely for cooling, so in point of fact it did not operate as a thermostat. He told me I needed to set the thermostat to 95 degrees (the maximum setting) to make sure the heat did NOT come on! When I attempted to get Peter to admit this was not normal, he refused. I ushered him out.10 minutes later I realized I had forgotten to tell Peter that the toilet was not flushing completely. I called the operator to get this serviced. 5 minutes later Peter appears and is holding a plunger like a weapon and is accompanied by a security guard. Perhaps he thought I was going to punch him in the nose?! By the way, Peter was wrong about the thermostat stopping the heat blowing when set to 95. Monday morning the heat came on anyway. (The heat is on a timer period).I won't bother you with the story about Cox Internet services lying to me about why I could not get online. I had to go downstairs and get the help of Mr Sayed, the assistant manager before I could get service.Did I mention Friday morning I called about my personal feather pillow having gone missing? I do not believe it was intentionally stolen, but rather mistakenly taken by housekeeping. Despit having spent a half hour with two men from Hotel security, and filling out a form for them, NO ONE has called or contacted me. All I wanted was for someone to find and ask the lady who made up my room if she remembers removing a pillow thinking it defective?I ended by asking Mr Lobek if he took issue with any of the facts in my letter. I don't know as I have not heard from him. Since I paid the bill in full, I guess we are done.Please note this is a Binions Property. Do not expect better service across the street at Binions Casino. I had the chance to speak to a restaurant manager in Binions about the miserable restaurant service, and he explained to me what it was like being in between the union and management during a contract dispute. I advise the public to steer clear of both of these places.	
Apr 3 2009 	Dollars 	Well have to tell you I have stayed at the Four Queens Since 1998 my first Vegas trip the staff is among the best in any hotel I have ever stayed in, the rooms were remodeled little over a year ago and have flat screen tv's, comfy beds and if you want more pillows they will send the up. The rooms are not huge but not small and very well decorated not garish or cheap. I love the coffemakers, irons &amp; blowdryers in the rooms not many Downtown Las Vegas hotels have them. The Location is right there on Fremont street if your a fan of the show CSI you have seen the Four Queens and Golden Nugget many times at the end of the Strip is the Plaza hotel which was featured in Back to the Future II. The Fremont experience is fun and a nice evening distraction from Gambling and free. The Casino Floor is smaller than most and some areas feel cramped with machines to close together it can get smokey but they do have great ventilation. The Magnolia Restraunt has good food and great specials its all kept very clean and you never feel unsafe, if you get bored there are lots of Casinos in walking distance as in across the street literally if staying Downtown I reccomend the Four Queens for friends and family as well as the Golden Nugget next door if your not bringing kids you can get a better deal but not as nice a location at the El Cortez its about two three blocks away away from the Fremont Experience these are also my three faves to gamble in one other fave is the Golden Gate a few blocks down from the Four Queens if you go on a holiday weekend be ready it gets crowded and the crowd gets younger the average age for this area is 30-senior and that keeps the rowdy level down but it does get rockin on holidays and there are often free concerts.	
Apr 2 2009 	Okay hotel good value.	Stayed three nights at Four Queens in March. Booked primarily for price. Average stay, sort of a Best Western with a casino. Plain room, clean. Noisy on Fremont Street side but they shut down the Fremont Street experience fairly early. Like the convenience of being able to walk easily to adjacent casinos. Did not play in casino but rather at Golden Nugget across street.Only ate at subway downstairs in casino. Tried to get a beer at the brew pub in mezzanine above casino, not at all crowded, but walked out after the bartender walked by several times without acknowledging me while she acknowledged the locals at the bar, and then got on the phone.	
Mar 22 2009 	Good Times!	We loved this place! The rooms were clean and the hotel is in a prime location. We casino-hopped up and down Fremont Street during March Madness and we had such a great time. I don't think we will ever stay on the strip again. Everything is cheaper and less crowded in this area. The 4 Queens has a somewhat small casino compared to some of the others in the area but they still have the basics. We had a room in the North Tower facing Fremont Street and we were under the canopy so we could see the light show at night from our room (if we were ever in our room). I thought this was pretty cool but the noise would definitely keep you up if you were trying to sleep. Luckily we stayed out most of the night - otherwise you might want to request a room facing the other side. Drink service was ok if you were at the tables or playing Keno - I don't know about the slots. Magnolias Restaurant inside the 4 Queens had decent sandwiches at ok prices for lunch. The pizza place had so-so pizza and so-so beers. I liked the Amber best. I think they had 9 of their own local drafts that they served - you could get a 5 flavor sampler for $6 or a 9 flavor sampler for $8 or $9 if you want to try them all.The hotel doesn't have a pool but you can show your room key at Binion's right across the street and use theirs.Overall, I think we received great value for what we paid - we got a deal on Hotels.com that came out to about $30/night.	
Mar 20 2009 	Great place at bargain rates!	The 4 Queens Hotel and Casino is located on Fremont Street, next to the Golden Nugget. It's midway along the Freemont Street Experience area. I stayed there March 8 - 13, 2009.The hotel was recently renovated, so that now there are icemakers and vending machines on almost every floor. The rooms are moderately sized but not cramped, with adequate counter space in the bathrooms - which have 4' bathtubs with shower over; and there is plenty of closet space. They are clean and tastefully decorated. I had a plumbing problem in that the shower/tub faucet leaked loudly and with arthritic hands it was impossible to open the faucet valve when it had been forced closed to stop the leak. Hotel maintenance removed the hardware and replaced it within 24 hours of my report. Excellent housekeeping services as well. Where other hotels I've stayed at in Vegas have a card you're requested to leave on the bed if you want the linens changed before you leave (otherwise they are not changed), there were no such cards here and my beds were changed after 3 nights - even though I was only staying 5 nights.Lower floors will include rooms that look out onto the &quot;hardware&quot; of the Fremont Experience jumbotron, but the upper floors offer unobstructed views. If you get a room on the Fremont Street side of the hotel, expect to hear the sound and light show until sometime after midnight nightly. The rooms come with a flat-screen TV, coffeemaker, iron and ironing board. The in-room safe is larger than most; it comprises the area that would otherwise be the bottom drawer of the bedside table - which is bolted to the floor - and allows the room occupant to set his/her own combination.  There are several restaurants located on the casino level, including Hugo's Cellar and Magnolia Cafe. Players club members are offered daily menu specials at Magnolia's. The slot machines include some of the latest released games and are placed such that the casino does not have a &quot;cramped&quot; atmosphere.	
Mar 15 2009 	Nice place to stay	I thought this casino/hotel was a nice place -except if you ever stay make sure you ask for a room that is not located right above the Fremont street-or you will hear the noise/music form the fremont street exp. all night.If that will not bother you then no problem, but i have to have it relatively quiet to sleep--but despite that i thought the room was very nice-we had suite, with a jacuzzi and it was spacious and clean!Nicely decorated.The casino has a very wide variety of slots and other games,and everyone was nice and friendly.So if staying downtown i would recommend it for the value and atmosphere-and of course all the other casinos are right thtere to walk to if you want.	
Mar 11 2009 	Good Overall Experience	We decided to take a trip to Las Vegas at the last minute and found a great deal through Expedia which included a standard room at the Four Queens. We arrived at the hotel at around 10 am, and were able to check in right then. The standard room we were given was on the 7th floor, facing Fremont street, but unfortunately our view was right into the light grid. The room itself was somewhat small, and older looking, and we decided to see if we could upgrade. The lady at the front desk informed us that upgrading would be an additional $40/ day, but we got such a good deal to begin with that we took it. They had it ready for us right then, and it was very nice. Not brand new, and not a room on the strip, but good for us. There was a sitting area with a pair of chairs, and coffee table in front of the flat screen tv, as well as a leather couch, and a table and two chairs in front of the windows. The bed was a very comfortable king. There was also a bar area which had a small sink, small fridge, and a coffee maker. The bathroom was clean enough, but the black tile in the tub/shower, made it seem a little dark. We met the maid, Sharon, on our way out the second day, and she was very nice. Our room was made up wonderfully every day, and she was always greeted us with a friendly &quot;Good Morning&quot;, when she saw us on our way out for the day. I was happy with the whole experience.	
Mar 8 2009 	great staygreat time	This was a great place to stay for our 3 nights in Las Vegas. The rooms were clean and comfortable and even had a great view. We got to town way before check-in and the front desk let us into our room right away. Any staff member we had contact with during the whole stay was so helpful and friendly. I would come back again for sure.	
Mar 1 2009 	Overall good experience	I stayed at Four Queens 02/23-02/27 and only paid 32.00 per night. We are not high maintenance people and therfore did not expect a lot for the price. We arrived right at checkin time and therefore expected a long line. That was not the case, we were through check in with no problems in minutes. Our room was on the second floor and although the first night it seemed very noisy, the remainder of the week was fine. The room itself needed some maintenance. One of the closet doors did not open. The heater made a constant noise. Also, the water in the tub did not drain. And the lights next to the bed were very hard to turn on. (the switch stuck) We should have asked for another room, however, we are not complainers and did not spend much time in the room. The cleaning staff was very friendly and when we asked for extra coffee there was no problem. We did not eat in the hotel as the line at Magnolias was extremely long during normal dinner hours. Overall we had a good trip. The staff at the hotel was very friendly. My three previous trips to Vegas I stayed on the strip, but I think in the future, I will always be downtown. It is much more reasonable and very easy and cheap to take the Deuce up to the strip.	
Feb 27 2009 	Great for the frugal gambler!	We stayed at this hotel from 02/16-02/19. We booked through Expedia and got the third night free. Check in was fast. We were suprised how nice the hotel looked. We asked for the coupon book and got it. First thing we did was check into the Player's club and received free gifts. Our room was neat and clean - think Comfort inn or Best Western. We ate at Magnolias with the 2 for 1 coupon and it was okay. Our last night we ate at Hugo's which was very expensive and fancy but worth every penny. Fremont street was great. This is a great place to go if you want to make your money last. We had a blast and would definately stay again! I played mostly penny slots and was able to parlay $20 into $380 dollars (even though I poured it all back into the machines - it was fun). Came real close to winning the Foose Mustang! Saw Gordie Brown at the Golden Nugget - he was great. Ate at the Mainstreet buffet - best in town. All in all a great stay!	
Feb 25 2009 	Awesome 1st time on Fremont	We stayed at the 4 Queens Oct 4th thru the 10th. I booked it as part of our flight package through US Air. Compared with booking the flight alone, we got the rooms for literally nothing. I think it came up to around $10 a day if that (that is why we stayed for almost a week).We arrived at 10:30am &amp; decided to try checking in. We were told room would not be ready until 2p. I asked if there were any upgrades available, was told not for free, but for $40 a night we could have a mini suite. Since we had not really paid anything for the rooms I took it.The mini suite was available to check in right away. As one of the previous posters said, yes the hotel is old, yes the walls are a little thin, but I have paid 5 times as much for a room elsewhere &amp; had it be a horrible room. We had a non smoking room &amp; there was no smoke smell in the room at all.The mini suite consisted of a large dresser near the front door of room, a &quot;living room&quot; area with a small desk, a decent size &quot;coffee&quot; table with 2 chairs. A large armoire tv cabinet in the living room area. A small &quot;dining&quot; table &amp; 2 chairs. A large leather couch &amp; king size bed. On the wall next to the bed was the &quot;bar&quot; area. It had a very small sink in it &amp; under the counter was a mini fridge. I will try to attach pics, but I have not done any editing to them, so they may be to large. I try to get a lot of pics for a trip advisor report.The bathroom had a large double sink &amp; a decent bath tub &amp; tiled walls instead of a normal bathtub surround. Nothing overly fancy.We tipped the cleaning woman $5 the first morning &amp; asked for extra towels, later that afternoon we came back up to the room, she found us in the hall &amp; thanked us about 10 times. When we got into the room, she had taken all of our personal bathroom stuff (we had just dumped it on the counter) and arranged it on a towel &amp; we had more towels than we would have needed for the entire week. Tips go a long way &amp; I dont mean just to the cleaning people.Remember, if you have a car, valet parking is free as long as you get a VIP pass from the front desk.We did not take our laptops so I can not comment on the high speed internet. They did have internet Kiosks you can use to print out your boarding passes. I think it cost like $3 for 10 minutes.The room service was unbelievably cheap compared to other places I have stayed. I ordered a 1/2 pound double cheeseburger for under $7 &amp; the &quot;fee&quot; was them including 18% gratuity to the bill.Magnolias was great. $5.95 breakfast specials &amp; $7.95 dinner specials for players club members. The prime rib is only $9.95 if you are not a member. It is not the highest quality of prime rib, but it is only 1 or 2 levels from the top. If you are not in a 5 star $50 plus per steak restaurant, this is the same kind of prime rib you will get elsewhere. And according to all of the staff, the same chefs from Hugos Cellar work at Magnolias.I have never been a big slot player (normally lose everything I put in), but I decided to try my hand at some slots on the first day. Won $50 right off on a nickel wheel of fortune (put in $20), cashed out. While I was waiting for my girlfriend to finish playing her first $20, I got bored &amp; put another $20 in. On my next to the last pull I hit for $255. I was very excited.After this I was hooked. Of course I lost more than I won, but I must admit I won a decent amount at the 4 Queens. Any casino we were at out on the strip, I never won anything. This just goes to show every person is going to have a different experience. Am I saying other people posting about their experience at this same hotel &amp; casino were wrong? No, not at all. We may have different expectations or we may have just lucked out on everything.I also won over a total of $300 at 3 card poker (technically $200 profit).All in all it was a great trip. Would I pay full price for a mini suite? Maybe not. Would I have enjoyed it as much if we had a normal room? Hard to say, we didnt spend a lot of time in the room.I will admit, when we checked out my comps were not as much as I expected (after that first win I played a lot of slots &amp; a decent amount of time at card tables as well as my girlfriend spending a lot of time doing both also), but that may be because we received a different bonus &amp; they felt that was enough compensation (sorry cant talk about it).And if you want to check on your comps, do not wait until the last night you are there. You have to check with a slot host. Their offices are located right next door to the front desk &amp; every time we tried to talk to them, they were not there. We had to have them check our bill after we left &amp; they knocked off some food charges &amp; stuff like that &amp; then mailed us the final receipt.If you want to know more, shoot me a message, I did a detailed report on my personal blog, but I will not post a link to it in an open forum like this. If you have any questions at all, let me know.Sorry if it sounds like I rambling, I am trying to post everything I can think of, in as short of a story as possible.We really enjoyed Fremont &amp; everything downtown. Also I must tell you, if you are thinking about going to the Valley of Fire, do it. Definitely worth the trip.Another plus about staying at 4 Queens. Walgreens is less than 10 minutes away. My girlfriend had forgotten her hairbrush &amp; by the time she was out of the shower, I had already returned from buying a new one.Oh &amp; there is a liquor store less than 5 minutes away. What more could you ask for?	
Feb 25 2009 	4 Queens......far from royalty!! Checked out as soon as we arrived	My fiance and I just got back from Vegas and we originally were supposed to stay at the 4 Queens, but as soon as we opened the door to our rooom...we checked out!! We ended up booking a hotel on the strip (much wiser choice)! The casino is very old and all you smell is smoke when you walk in the entrance. The rooms are very small and not clean. Our view from the room was horrible, all you could see was the framework for the lighting show beneath. The set up of the Freemont Experience might have been a cool concept many years ago, but they need to clean up and modernize things. Overall, we had an amazing trip but it was because we made a quick decision to get out of the 4 Queens!! Believe it or not...you can stay at a nice place on the strip for $60 during the week.	
Feb 23 2009 	Our first stay off the strip	We go to Vegas a couple of times a year and always stay on the strip. We wanted to experience Fremont Street so booked at the Four Queens. Our check in around 2 P.M. was quick. No coupon books were offered to us. We had a room on the fourth floor and could sit in our room have a cocktail and watch the light show. It was really quite enjoyable. We had no problem with Fremont street keeping us awake. We turned on the TV and fell asleep to it. The room itself was small but clean. As stated in other reviews the towels were big and fluffy. The bed was very comfortable. There is a coffee pot in the room. This doesn't take away from the fact the hotel is old. The rooms have been remodeled and are comfortable but you can hear every sound in the hall. The hallways are very narrow and the ceilings low as well. All that being said the room cost us $25.00 for the night. How can you beat that for comfy clean place to stay. The cocktail waitresses were great and seemed to always have a smile on their faces. The machines were dead cold though. Oh well, you can't have it all.We ate a Magnolia's. We have always enjoyed eating there when we left the strip for a day on Fremont. This time however. The meal wasn't as good as it usually is. We will however try it again the next time we are in Vegas.If we stay downtown again we most likely will try The Golden Nugget. The four Queens was OK but would like to try another hotel on Fremont Street.	
Feb 23 2009 	Fun and Friendly at the 4 Queens	My friend and I stayed at the 4 Queens Feb 17-20. I have always stayed on the strip, but last year we took a cab to the Downtown area and we had a blast. So this year we wanted to stay Downtown. We picked the 4 Queens because it is right in the middle of everything on Fremont St, it has great reviews, and the price was right.We took the shuttle from the airport to the 4 Queens. The 4 Queens has a small area for cars to drop people off or drop off for the valet, but it seemed to work. Check in was fast and easy. I requested a room in the south tower on an upper floor. Our room was not cleaned yet (it was only 2pm), but they let us store our luggage in the room. The room was perfect the lady at check in put us in a corner room. I dont think that it was any bigger than other rooms, but we had a view in two directions and only people on one side of us. We dropped our luggage off and went downstairs. The first place we went to was the players club to sign up for our cards. We were given a deck of cards in a metal case and a voucher each for Magnolia's Cafe for two for one entres. I was given an extra voucher as it was my birthday. We went over to Magnolia'a Cafe, but got sidetracked at the Craps table. There was a crowd so I watched for a minute. The table was hopping so I tried my luck. 10 minutes later and $40.00 up we went to the Cafe. There was a small line but we did not have to wait long. The hostess was nice and friendly. Our waitress was really nice and very fast. The food was hot and tasted great. We had no problem using the vouchers and off we went.Fremont st is a great place to watch people. We went down to Mermaids and recieved our beads, played some slots and actually won! I came in here last year and played. We had a great waitress last year. She was still there this year.Later we went back to the 4 Queens. My friend played some roulette while I played a little more craps. We both won a little. The dealers at the 4 Queens are great. They are very helpful. We went back up to our room. It was cleaned, everything looked great. When you walk into the room on the right side is a large closet. On the left side is the bathroom. In the bathroom there is a tub/shower combo. There is a single sink with a large amount of counter space. They had an ice bucket, plastic cups, shampoo, lotion, and a small bar of soap on the counter. There was also a hair dryer unit mounted on the wall. The bathroom itself was very clean. Many of the floor tiles were cracked, but that really did not matter. The towels were fine, not big and fluffy, but you have to remember where you are staying. This is not the Ritz, but it is very nice.In the room there is a place to put your suitcase. There is also a stand for the flat screen TV that has 4 drawers under the TV. Next to the stand is the desk and chair. We had two queen beds in the room and between them was a small nightstand with a safe. The bedding was not old or new and looked nice. The blankets are thinner than mine at home, but that was easy to remedy, I called and asked for another and it was brought to me within 10 minutes. Overall the room was very comfortable, the views were great and where we were in the South Tower it was quiet. There was no noise from the Fremont St Experience at all.The next day we spent on the strip. It was busy, but not as busy as when I was in Las Vegas last year. There were specials everywhere on food, drink, shows, nightclubs, rooms, etc. Happy hours specials being run all day. We walked from Mandalay Bay all the way to the Sahara. Took all day as we stopped everywhere.That evening we had dinner at Magnolia's Cafe. We had a different waitress, but she was just as great as our first waitress. My friend had the prime rib special, $7.95 with the players card, and I had the lasagna. We both had the salad, when my friend asked for extra croutons they were brought right away. Both dishes were perfect. My friend loved the prime rib, it came with veggies and a potato.Check out was very easy, we had no problems.I would definatly stay at the 4 Queens again.	
Feb 23 2009 	watch out for the	I am a frequent traveler to Las Vegas and 99.9% of the time stay at the Freemont area. This was the first time I stayed at the Four Queens. There were six of us staying at the hotel. The hotel is clean, however, the smoke penetrates every pore of your body and clothes. The main issue I had with the hotel/management was their confusing manner of keeps tabs on comps. Not a friendly system to access your comps...Usually I am able to access info from pit boss, resturant, etc but here you can only get from &quot;host&quot; at players office. Even upon check out the staff could not tell me what my comps were and said they would relay info to the &quot;host&quot; and let me know what I qualified for&gt;&gt;&gt;(yeah right!!!)	
Feb 9 2009 	Good value	I stayed here on a Thursday night after arriving from the airport to avoid a higher rate at the hotel I was staying at the rest of the weekend. Got a great rate - $32, plus another $3 for parking. I was afraid that my flight might be canceled, so I would be out $32 at worst. My stay was without incident, but be more alert while going from the parking garage to the lobby. It feels a tad more deserted at 2 a.m. compared to a Strip parking deck. This is a great place to stay if you want a room at a really inexpensive rate, especially on weekdays.The Good:- Friendly desk staff- Decent sized room- Great rateThe Bad:- Smoky casino, but it's downtown Las Vegas- Some noise from Fremont Street if your room oversees Fremont. - Parking is $3 a day.	
Feb 9 2009 	best hotel rate for a good room	Hotels.com messed up our reservation,but the staff did everything possible to make our stay pleasant By far the best customer service from the front desk and managers Alba and Rod that I have ever received from any hotel. We will definitely stay at the 4queens again. A little word of advice....If you book through Hotels.com be sure to call the hotel and confirm your reservation.	
Jan 30 2009 	Great hotel	I had stayed in Downtown Vegas before in 2002 and found that it represented better value than The Strip...and after all a casino, is a casino, is a casino. Being thus thrifty I caught the bus to the hotel from the airport, the journey took about 45 minutes. The check in at The Four Queens was quick and I found the room spotless with a very comfortable bed. The dealers were very helpful when I was playing BlackJack as I am a novice and there a variety of betting limits on the table games. I didn't eat at the casino as I like buffets and there isn't one there. Fremont Street has plenty of action going on and can be a little noisy if you wanted to get an early night but one doesn't go to Vegas for a early night surely??!! I look forward to staying at The Four Queens again	
Jan 27 2009	would stay again	The rates are inexpensive but there is nothing cheap about this hotel. Very clean rooms, friendly staff where everyone said good morning to us. We stayed in the South Tower which was quiet. You can walk out the front door right into the pedestrian mall which is very fun to watch every night under the canopy. Everything is very convenient and parking is free if you are staying there. We grabbed The Deuce 1 block down and went down the Strip. I highly recommend this hotel in Vegas. Everything was great.	
Jan 18 2009 	Great time in Vegas	We stayed 4 nights at the Four Queens (10 people). I love the downtown area and the Four Queens is the perfect place to stay. Vegas downtown is more relaxed, casinos are closer and the deals are better. I have stayed at other hotels downtown and by far for the price the Four Queens is tops. The only problem we had was slow service at the bar.	
Jan 11 2009 	Met all expectations	Fourth time downtown, and the first at the Four Queens. Check in was quick, and we asked for - and received - a room high up in the South Tower. The staff was all very polite and we had no problems with the room. I was worried about water pressure since we were on the top floor, but plenty of pressure and hot water was to be found. Housekeeping didn't leave us coffee twice, which was dissapointing, as we were looking forward to having an in-room coffee pot, and we were shorted once on towels but, for the price, we were very happy with our entire experience. The casino was great. The craps dealers were very friendly, and there were tons of gaming options to chose from.  If you want a five star hotel, you might want to pay more and go somewhere else. If you like downtown, like we do, and want to feel comfortable and safe, then this is the right place for you!	
Jan 9 2009	Not great Not bad	This is a OK hotel, as far as the rooms go. If you aren't high maintainence, you will be fine. My wife and I are very easy going so we had no problem, but I would understand if someone did. They say that there is a coffee maker in every room. Ours did, but no coffee provided. We asked housekeeping to give us some and were told to call housekeeping to get some. That so confused us we just gave up. The bathtub faucet had a steady drip...drip...drip. I don't hold that against them though, they would have probably moved us if I had complained, but I didn't since we were settled in before we noticed and we couldn't hear it while sleeping. The staff is another issue. For the most part they are excellent. I wish I could remember all of their names. (Damn that free alcohol) I do remember Winston in The Magnolia Cafe. Actually , all the wait staff there was great, the hostess staff and cashiers could be a little nicer though. Plus the head guy at The Chicago Brew Company was the best.	
Jan 4 2009 	Old style charm	The rooms were a good size and we managed to get adjoining rooms which was nice. Our room hadn't been cleaned when we checked in but a maid was sent really quickly and she was really pleasant and did a great job so it didn't cause us any problems. We often choose to stay Downtown when visiting Vegas because everything is on your doorstep. My Dad uses a wheelchair and so everything being close together in a pedestrian area is really useful. The rents are generally lower and the tables have lower limits for those of us who just want to play and not do too much serious gambling. The buses take you down the strip if you want to see the sights and to the shopping outlets for $5 for a 24 hour pass. You can use the rooftop pool at Binions (which is owned by the same people) across Fremont Street which is lovely. We were told they are soon to renovate it although I think it's ok as it is - with being on the rooftop even though we vacationed in november you don't get overshadowed so you have the best sun available with great views.	
Jan 2 2009 	4Q Great Hotel but small	i was in Vegas for 5 nights 12/12-12/17)and once again decided to stay DT. Many of my friends were also staying at 4Q, so that made my decision of where to stay easier.Check in at 11 pm on a Friday night was a breeze and I was able to obtain a room direclty across the hall from my friends who had checked in a few days earlier. They also gave me a parking pass that enabled me to use the valet for free for the entire stay. (You must get this pass or you will be charged for parking)I was in room 1929 in the South Tower. My room faced the Golden Nugget and to the side could see past the GN and all the way down Fremont to Plaza.The room had two queen size beds, a desk with 2 straight back desk chairs, a dresser and a flat screen TV. The safe was located in the night table. The coffee pot was on the desk. Coffee left in the room was regualr, and I had to request decaf but received it the next morning.The room was clean and fresh. Housekeeping did a very good job everyday and were very friendly. The room itself was ok in size. However, the bathroom was tiny, and I mean tiny. The hallway was quiet, I very seldom heard doors closing or people in the hallway. The 4 elevators to the tower were quick and I never had a long wait for one. Soda machines are on the odd numbered floors and the ice machines are on the even numbered floors. Needless to say I did not venture to the other floor for ice. I would have liked to have an easy chair in the room as I do like to relax and sit and read . I also had some friends in and out of my room several times and easy chairs would have been better to sit and catch up. Instead we sat on the beds.I ate at Magnolia's my last morning and with the player's card it, received a discount on breadfast. I also had luck in the casino. I was able to print out my boarding pass. on a computer right opposite the check in desk. Valet was prompt in retriving my car and is located near the Canyon Club.One upset ing fact. On Sunday afternoon, as I was getting out of the shower, I heard some knocking on the door, then the door opened and in walked a male housekeeping manager and secuirty. I was standing there in a towel!!! They quickly apologized and left. There was a mixup and they thought I had checked out. This was confirmed with a call to the front desk with the manager's name. The front desk could not apologize enough. Be sure to put the chain and or top lock on the door!!!!If I make another solo trip I will stay once again at 4Q.	
Dec 31 2008 	Just Okay	Upon check in - the lady who assisted me was on a personal call the entire time. I asked for a room with a view - &quot; all our rooms have the same view &quot;. She was not polite and like I said - was on a personal call the entire time. The room was okay - nothing fabulous. Didnt do well on the slots - the subway / pizza place was way overpriced. The great thing about the hotel - you are on Fremont street so many choices are right out the door.	
Dec 26 2008 	we have stayed here for years	We go to the rodeo every year and have stayed here in early December for at least 12 years. It is a small property, by Las Vegas standards, and easy to get around. The blackjack tables are friendly, Magnolias is a good place to eat, and the rooms are very good. I love the easy self-parking, and valet is great too but we seldom use it. The only complaint I have ever heard is a lady thinking the parking garage might not be safe, but have never haerd of an incident there, and I personally like it.	
Dec 24 2008 	A great choice for downtown	I stayed here the last few days of my trip. It was nice to have a clean comfortable room to relax in. The TV and cable package were great. Best part was looking out the window to see the Freemont street experience every hour. Costs a little more than other downtown locations but I felt it was well worth it.	
Dec 20 2008 	Excellent value in downtown Vegas	We stayed here in Sept 08.We read lots on this site before deciding that for our first trip to Vegas, we had to do the downtown experience for at least part of our stay. That was the best decision ever. We spent our first 3 nights of a 7-night stay at this Hotel. When we first arrived, we were already more than tipsy as we had met some people who were Vegas vets at the airport before we even headed out of Cedar Rapids, IA (they kept buying drink after drink and giving us all kinds of tips for places to check out and what to do), so I really cannot comment on the check-in service as it was a little fuzzy. :) However, the staff was great - very friendly - throughout the hotel for everything else we needed during our stay, although I have to say that the wait at Magnolias was quite long the time we went. The food there, however, was excellent and their was way more than we could eat. there for a very good price, especially when you add in the buy-one-get-one-free coupon that you can pick up. We did not really eat much else here as we were too busy exploring downtown.The room itself was a clean. The bed was comfy. It was a very basic room with a decent view at an affordable price in a fun area. That is everything I was looking for. I forgot to take pics of the room until we were getting ready to leave and it was messed up, but I included the shots just to give an idea of what the basic rooms look like.The view was pretty good from our room too. Again, I took a shot of the view night but it was not that good of a shot.There are also some excellent bargins at the gift shop at the hotel and the staff here were super friendly.You can use the pool at the top of Binions as long as you are staying here too, so although this hotel does not have a pool, you always have this option. We never had time to check it out, but I would definitely think that it would be worth a peek as it is on the 28th floor so it would probably be a nice relaxing time with a great view of downtown.I would definitely recommend this hotel to friends and family.ShawnBTW: The downtown area itself is a blast and you should really experience it at least once. I will write a separate review of the downtown area.	
Dec 20 2008 	Four Queens	Booked a deal through expedia for 5 nights and the average was 26.00 a night. Arrived at Valet which is off 3rd street DT at noon. Valet handed me receipt and told me to tell the desk clerk I was using valet and I would receive a VIP parking pass so parking was free. I was able to check in at noon, room not ready, I could store luggage at bell desk or in closet in room as room was vacant. I chose to go on up to the room and check it out even though it had not been cleaned. Not too bad, stowed luggage in closet and off I went. Upon returning to room around 4 I found it was clean. King size bed, safe beside bed by nightstand, flat screen, plenty of towels. Ice and soft drink machine were at the end of the hall. I was on the 10th floor.Cons-room would never get cool enough, it was facing west and the afternoon sun even with the curtains pulled seem to heat the room. Water took a long time to get hot in shower. Bed even though it was a pillow top,was very soft. Housekeeping missed room on 2nd day even though I had left a tip on the first day. I called down for some towels only and both the housekeeping person and the person that brought the towels up offered no apology, they both stated I must have had my Do not distrub sign up and I did not, I was gone all day. Pros, North tower is closest to Fremont. Magnolias and the Chicago Brewery have good food and reasonable. Hallways are short. Quiet room facing away from Fremont.Not bad for a solo traveler, room would have been very small for two people especially if staying longer than a couple of days.	
Dec 20 2008	4 Queens...a few very minor glitches but okay	I was not sure what to expect in a downtown Vegas hotel since my husband and I always stayed on the strip. This time, I agreed to go along with most others in our Old School Vegas group and book downtown. I found this deal in a travelocity flight + hotel package. The price was right when I booked in October. When I checked in I was given a room at the end of the hall on the 19th floor. I should have called the hotel right after making the reservations and requested my room preference. This room was very quiet and clean although the TV was not connected properly to the wall. A technician came quickly to fix the problem. A light bulb was burned out and the phone jack was partially pulled out which I was able to fix easily. A customer should not have to bother with any mechanical glitches. Other than those minor issues, the hotel was nice. Do not expect a five star establishment by any means but the decor was pretty basic and pleasing at the same time. Eventhough the elevator was at the other end of the hall, it was quick and not crowded. All hotel staff were friendly and efficient.	
Dec 19 2008 	Nice Hotel for a Very Low Rate	Checked in early afternoon, Sunday December 14th. There was no wait and the desk clerk was friendly. Had requested a non-smoking double on a higher floor to be away from Freemont Street noise and received room 1126 which was the very end room.The room was small, but clean. As everyone has said, the bathrooms are small but I think set up better than the ones at Gold Coast. The beds are pillow top and very comfortable.We ate one meal at Magnolia's. The food and service were both good and with a two for one coupon the bill came to less than $11.I thought the room was nice, but if I were staying alone I wouldn't feel comfortable walking to and from my car in the parking garage. I would definitely stay there again given the same low rate ($22 for 3 nights after a $50 coupon).	
Dec 18 2008 	great stay at a lovely hotel	we are here now during probably the worse weather vegas hasever had-it snowed twice so far this week-even with that we arehaving a great time at this very nice hotel-workers are veryfriendly-prices super reasonable-our room in the north towerhas a safe, coffee pot, iron, large flat screen tv, internet accessfor $9 a day-the north tower is wonderful right off the fremontexperience so you don't have to walk too far-ask for a room notfacing fremont so you don't get all the noise-parking is free for3 hours with validation-$3 for a 24 hour stay-this hotel is not aslarge &amp; plush as the nugget, but there is not as much walking-the rooms are about the same size as the nugget-you can geta great $8 prime rib dinner at magnolia's &amp; they have nightlyfood specials-we have enjoyed all of the meals here-we love thedowntown area to stay-we always rent a car to enjoy all of vegas-this trip we got a pt cruiser for 4 nights for only $48 total with fox-we will try &amp; stay at this hotel for our next visit here-can't be beatfor the price-	
Dec 17 2008 	Great Downtown Location	My wife and I love downtown Vegas and usually book the majority of our nights there, not on the Strip. When we decided on a weekend trip and couldn't convince the relatives to look after the kids, the Four Queens looked like it would probably suit our needs, especially given the favourable reviews I'd seen. Though not necessarily 'kid friendly', the price is right and the location is perfect.We arrived around 2 on a Friday afternoon, and though the room had not yet been cleaned we were able to get keys and store our luggage there. Check-in was very quick and staff were friendly.We booked a package and chose the 'low end' price, so the room we ended up with was not newly renovated. Though it did have the flat screen TV, the rest was pretty old and we actually had a handicapped bathroom. No big deal but it did make for an awfully high toilet for the kids. Nice to have a coffee maker, ironing board and a large safe, otherwise pretty standard. The room was clean, just tired looking.The big draw here is the location. Really, virtually all the downtown properties are central, but this one is dead center on Fremont Street. Not only that, the access is a breeze since you can go through the doors near the valet and bypass the entire casino. With no waits for the elevator we were able to leave our room and be on Fremont street in about 3 minutes!We didn't eat at any of the restaurants in the hotel/casino, but there is a decent selection. Of course, staying downtown means a quick walk is all it takes to get pretty much any food you want.I have to admit, we love the Gold Spike, and now it is being renovated into a 'boutique' property so we'll see how that pans out. Our philosophy is to sleep cheap and spend the savings on food or entertainment. So...I'd have to say that The Four Queens fit the bill very nicely for us on this trip.	
Dec 13 2008 	great price and very nice room	booked the hotel via hrs.com for a realy great price. the room was excelent and was better then expected. Any time again	
Dec 11 2008 	First Time Staying Downtown	Had been to Vegas many times before and had visited downtown just never stayed there. The 4 Queens was the cheapest option for the days in December I was going, so away I went. I don't spend too much time in my room in Vegas but was impressed with the 4 Queens room. I had a room in the south tower on the 15th floor. Very quiet, very clean, comfy bed (spent about 9hrs total sleeping in 2 nites) , excellent Flat Screen (watched about 10 minutes of the news in 2 nites there) had a safe, only drawback was the size of bathroom but remember this was the cheapest place I could find to stay. A tip is if you are really picky and like to complain stay at really expensive places on the strip. The casino was small but had lots of low limit table games with good pay tables (common downtown I played roulette at Binions and they have $2 min). I signed up for the players card at the 4Q and got a free deck of cards in a collectable tin then had a $8 Prime Rib dinner at Magnolias that was excellent. If you take off the value of the free gift I got, you could say dinner cost me $5! The parking garage costs guest $3 day but remember it's also $15-$20 a nite cheaper here. The garage and hotel are small which I like, makes things less confusing. Clientele was definetly older but I mainly hung out at the Poker rooms in Binions (excellent) and the Golden Nugget. Downtown has lots of cheap food options, beers are $2 all over and t-shirts and such are far cheaper downtown. I still enjoy the strip better but for a couple of nites and if you rent a car downtown can really save you some money.	
Dec 9 2008	No more single deck blackjack	I stayed at the Four Queens for the last 10 years because they had single deck Blackjack. In 2007 they went from 2 single deck tables to 1. This year there were none. I gambled 16 hours a day but did not gamble for 1 minute at the Four Queens. If you like single deck - Four Queens is no longer the place to gamble.	
Dec 9 2008 	Classy downtown property	Four Queens staff treat you with class all the time. From front desk, restaurant, BJ dealers, craps, security, all a class act. Great for weekend w/ the guys or for married couples. Not exactly the fancy hotel to sweep a new girl off her feet, though I'd recommend The Venetian for that. Rates are cheap and excellent value. Like all downtown casinos, lower bet minimums on craps/roulette until it gets busy.Go to their website, print out a pre-register sheet for their players club and get a free gift...... Mine was a 4Queens set of pajamas, another user on this site got a tote bag. Ask the pit boss for &quot;comps for two&quot; and he'll give you at least a &quot;2 for 1&quot; comp. Highly recommend. Been to Las Vegas 6 time and last two times I stayed at 4Queens and probably will stay again next year.	
Dec 8 2008 	Needs renovation poor room service	This place is ok at a price. It is not ok for a romantic getaway or nice resort type vacation. The location on Freemont street is fun for a few days. There is no pool, minimal restaurants and no buffet.The room was adequate but not very clean. It needed a thorough detailing. It had been upgraded slightly. New bathroom tiles that they also used to tile the counter. A tiled counter cannot be properly cleaned because of the grout lines. The tub took 30 minutes to drain. The bath tap drizzled hot water constantly. It must cost them a lot of money to not fix these. The drain was heavily corroded and rusted so it had been leaking for a long time. I guess the room attendant just never bothered to report it. We did when we left. It had a newer flat screen tv and a room safe. The bedding was ultra cheap. The beds were barely comfortable. Our room attendant never restocked our supplies which were about the cheapest crap you can get so we didn't complain. We just got our own. The coffee maker was never cleaned, emptied or restocked. Again no loss. I won some money at the tables but the pit boss made you feel like you were stealing so I gambled next door at the Golden Nugget which was much better. I would recommend it if you can get a room for about $20 a night and aren't too picky.	
Dec 6 2008 	Downtown rules	Great stay. Great room , Great service. Even managed to win some good money in the casino. Say hi to the dealer Joe from the &quot;canadian pilot&quot;	
Dec 5 2008 	A Downtown experience	Stayed for 4 nights will attending CES. Cannot really complain to much, as the rate we paid was very cheap. Booked a twin room, but was given a king bed only. A little dissapointed with the ability of the staff to resolve this issue.We were given another room facing Freemont Street. Now be warned that the noise level is quite high. Stay on a higher floor!Overall we did enjoy our stay at this hotel.	
Nov 30 2008	Great Value and Quality	I booked one night here, a sunday, the last day of my trip because i wanted to go downtown and it ended up cheaper to stay overnight than to take a cab. Through I4Vegas.com it was $32 including taxes and fees for the night. The bargain was unbeatable. The rooms were smaller than those on the strip but had flat screen tv's, clean rooms, comfortable beds and great service. The hotel staff was very helpful, the location is prime right on fremont street, and the hotel restauraunts are great. Only drawback was the older bathrooms but they still were decent. I would reccomend this hotel to anyone who wants to stay downtown in a heartbeat. I also enjoyed the casino area as well, except for the timeshare people but that is eveywhere in vegas.	
Nov 29 2008 	overall good service	this is a nice old vegas style hotel that for the price is perfect for anyone who just wants a place to hang your hat at night.check in was easy and helpful.room was clean with coffee machine,iron and board,king size bed,plenty of towels,flat screen tv.stayed on the 16th floor, north tower, but if you go to bed early,you may be bothered by the noise for the fremont experence till almost 1 or 2 am.housekeeping staff was excellent.i saw my housekeeper on the first day and tipped her at once.needless to say, my room was vacumed,clean sheet everyday,and plenty of the extras...soap,shampoo,towels,extra coffee,ashtrays,{yes this is a smoking room},etc.we had a small party on our second night in the room before hitting the strip...about 10 people and the room was a mess.got up next mourning and went to binons across the street at about 7:30 am.great breakfast there in the coffee shop...only $1.99. when i came back to the room about 9:30 am. the room was spotless....excellent job!!! i would book this hotel again..ken,melbourne,fl	
Nov 24 2008 	Awesome	We just returned from a wonderful experience we could have had. This was our 1st time visiting this town. the hotel employee's were wonderful, food was great and would recomend this hotel. When I booked this vacation I based it on reviews by other people, they were right, couldn't have picked a better place. I would recommend that since you are in the downtown area, to visit the strip, take the bus $5.00 for 24hrs well worth it, even though it took us 20 minutes we got to see alot. I hope anyone who does book here has the same experience as we did.	
Nov 20 2008 	Best Value in Las Vegas!	Once again the Four Queens exceeded my expectations. Having stayed here 4 times in the last year and a half I can not say enough good things. If you are looking for a fancy lobby and fast elevators this is not the hotel for you. However, if you are on a budget and looking for a great deal this is the place for you. I payed $59 for a Saturday night and $29 for Sun/Mon. Try finding that on the strip. Hotel is clean, safe, and staff is excellent. Was able to get checked in at 9:00 AM on Saturday moning. The hotel is located in the heart of the Fremont Street Experience (can be noisy) so if you value some peace and quiet make sure you request a room facing AWAY from the Fremont Street experience. Also for those of you wanting to go to the strip the bus stop is a stone's throw away. The bus is called the deuce and you get get a 24 hour unlimited ride pass for $5. The Fremont Street Experience really takes off aat night so I usually hit the strip in the day and head back to the Four Queens at night. Chicago Brewing Company (one of their restaurants) has great pizza and beer. Their other restaurant (magnolias) leaves a little bit to be desired. For those of you who insist on staying on the strip you may want to try staying downtown sometime. I think you will be surprised at how affordable and fun it could be. Where on the strip can you walk into a casino bar and buy an ice cold Corona or Heineken for $2.	
Nov 18 2008 	Four Queens was pretty good	We stayed 3 nights at the Four Queens and had a great time. We were allowed to check in early, even though check in was not until 4:00. The room was comfortable and the bathroom sufficient. Don't expect a 4 star hotel, but it was nice. There was some construction around or in the hotel some mornings that tended to be loud, but overall it was bearable. We ate at Magnolia's and it was okay. Be sure to get the coupon sheet from the Freemont office for a 2-for-1. The casino is nice but took all of our money. We really enjoyed being downtown and everything being so close. I don't think we will ever stay on the strip again.	
Nov 18 2008	okay if you like a cold shower	Stayed in room in 1819 for two nights, this past weekend. We had no hot water in the shower. I informed the front desk the next morning at 5:00 am and was told that a maintenance man woud look into it, on arriving back in the hotel that afternoon, still no hot water. The room was small and there was lots of static, you got a shock every time you turned on the lights and pressed the elevator button.We had given a king bed with only three pillows and the comforter was stained.You could hear noise from the other rooms next to you, so it as not that sound proof.Any way, I woulkd just say it was OK!	
Nov 17 2008	Great stay at the Four Queens	Being a fan of downtown Las Vegas we opted to stay at the Four Queens based on the reviews. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Our unit was very clean , roomy &amp; comfortable! The location is in the center of the Freemont St Experience making it convenient to everything the area offers; we will definitely stay there again!	
Nov 10 2008 	super stay!	What a great and pleasant surprise with our stay at 4 Queens! While the room wasn't super huge, it was adequate for what we wanted. I do have to say the bathroom was small but for the money -also served our needs! We did have a plugged sink, but I called the front desk and within 15 minutes we have a maintenance fellow up to check out the problem, and within an hour he had us up an running! and all with a great attitude!! ! It was quiet, we overlooked Golden Nugget. Be sure to join the players club to use your card for great food at Magnolia's Generous portions and food was delicious! Gambling was great=had new machines and some old favorites.Staying downtown was definitely a winning idea! also easy to use the bus system. thanks for reading my review-and I hope you enjoy your stay at Four Queens	
Nov 9 2008 	Couldn't have been better	Checked into the Four Queens about 4:00 pm on 11/3/08, told the desk clerk that we were there for our 15th anniversary and asked if there were any upgrades available not really expecting much. I was pleasently surprised when she told us that she had moved us up to a suite at no charge.  Room was in the south tower away from Fremont Street on the 3rd floor, very clean and spacious and at the end of the hall so we didn't have drunks walking past the room making noise all night. Bathroom large and clean with double vanity, plenty of room for wife's and my stuff both. Large flat screen TV with two chairs and comfortable leather couch.  No complaints at all. Staff were all very friendly and helpful, maids always asked if we were ready for the room to be cleaned and never had any complaints if we weren't. On scale with the suite we had at the old Stardust Casino.  Parking was easy to reach from the elevators and the attendant at the ticket booth even told us about the VIP parking vouchers available at the front desk for guests instead of just charging us for parking. Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone. Only complaint, and this has nothing to do with the hotel, the streets in the vicinity of the hotel were torn up and only one way in some areas due to construction. Very confusing and difficult to get to the parking garage at night or if you didn't know the area.	
Nov 8 2008 	Great stay as usual	Stayed at Four Queens in October for the third time for three nights. Really enjoy the location, casino, and Magnolias. Very glad to now have a safe in the room. We arrived at 8:30am and room was ready. Just what we asked for. Nice to have a coffee pot in the room. Stayed next 2 nights at Harrahs and no coffeepot. Room was cleaned, no plumbing issues. Casino is fun, drink service some of the best we had all trip. Magnolias is a little slow but no big deal. Looking forward to going back again	
Nov 6 2008 	good deal	i got a great deal on this place. can not beat location and the area has so much to offer. can find some great deals on food. this is the second time i stayed at freemont and we took another couple for they first time and we all loved it. we went to the strip and walked ourself to death. i have stayed on the strip 4 times and i dont think i will ever stay on the strip again. we did use the bus ( the duce) to travel to the strip. the only good thing about it is the price $5. bus makes many stops and very crowed. dont get me wrong it works but a slow ride. we booked a limo for airport transfer . nice . we used bell limos. only $56. used a taxi/van ride back to airport and cost was $40 + tip. kinda of spendy i think.but all in all the four queens was a great hotel. stayed in room 1427 it was nice but our friends had room 1444 and it had a great view. food at the resturants at 4 queens was great and the price was right . i would stay at 4 queens again with out question.	
Nov 5 2008 	Our new 'Home Base' in Vegas	Over the past 12 years my wife and I have visited Vegas many times. We have lodged at many different properties both on the strip and downtown. We believe we have found an appropriate 'home base' for our subsequent vists.Check in was a breeze. From the curb to the room in less than 10 minutes. When making reservations I requested a room away from Fremont Street and it was granted. We had room 1015 North tower. The room and bathroom were not large but it was clean and the bed was comfortable. The AC worked well and was fairly quiet but the plumbing noise from the shower was kind of annoying. Housekeeping did a great job and always asked if we needed anything. Coffee makers in the room is a plus. Flatscreen TV also a plus. Checking out was also pain free and quick. I guess I gambled enough on the tables to earn me some comps on the room. Hint: Have the floor folks rate your play at the tables and always use your players card at the slots. Check with the Casino Host or Slot Host before you check out to see if you qualify for any comps. Most of the staff at the Four Queens were helpful and friendly. Other than a couple of grouchy wait staff at Magnolias everyone seemed cheerful. The blackjack and craps dealers were fun, especially on Halloween. Picture a clown supervising a sexy policewoman who is dealing blackjack to three divas. Fun times. Aside from a craps session at O'Shea's, we gambled exclusively at the Four Queens. Whenever we venture out to the strip to catch a show or to see Big Elvis (at least once a trip!) it's only a short walk to The Deuce - the bus stop is at the corner of LV Blvd and Fremont, look for the big glass of beer! For $5 you can get a 24 hour pass that will get you from one end of the strip to the other and back downtown.Good value, good service, good hotel, good gaming, good location downtown. We will definitely be returning the the Four Queens.	
Nov 4 2008 	You can do Better	Reserved a non-smoking room, ended up with a smoking room. Everything smelled like smoke...mattress, blankets, pillows. Moved to non-smoking next morning, black hair hanging on bathtub, took a shower &amp; the tub clogged. Took 3 stops at the front desk (about 9pm) b4 finally fixed. Next day housekeeping left us 3 floor mats for shower towels. Will never stay at this pit again.	
Oct 28 2008 	Wow ..... what a ride	Wow..what a ride...the Best Hotel and Casino on Fremont StreetWe love it downtown....The check in was very fast... we upgradedto a Petite Suite...soooooo nice..lots of space and seating. We had our two daughters and their husbands along and the Hotel was so nice to put us all on the same floor...The food was wonderful and fast service.... The slots were fun...One of the things we really liked was how the hotel and casino is set up..when you come down on the elevator...you are right at the check in desk and the Casino is right there....no walking forever to get to the Casino.... the Maids were there every day to clean our room and always asked if we needed any items...brought blankets and extra coffee for us.... not one bad experience... We plan to go back over and over again...will only stay at the Four Queens.......When we got ready to check out ..they gave us a really good comp.... What a way to celebrate our 40th Wedding Anniversary. We loved everything about this Hotel and Casino	
Oct 18 2008 	the best place to stay	We went to Vegas to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary, we stayed at the Four Queens hotel and loved it!All of the staff from the front desk to houskeeping were so friendly and helpful.They have some great resturants there. Our room was ready when we arrived in the morning, and very clean and roomy. our bed had a pillow top mattress and was extremly comfortable. We loved the Freemont Experience with the light shows and all of the casinos being close together. We were able to walk from hotel to hotel late at night and felt very safe doing it.We would highly recommend staying at the Four Queens, and will stay there again when we return. I cannot think of anything negative to say about our stay, except we did not win any big jackpots anywhere! The atmosphere was wonderful. We have stayed at other hotels on Freemont Street and they did not even come close to comparing to the Four Queens for cleanliness , comfort or how friendly everyone was.	
Oct 17 2008 	Great Value	This is our fourth time to stay at the Four Queens. Fortunately the Hotel is partnered with Allegiant Airlines and the package offered is not only a great value, it is convenient. The rooms are clean and housekeeping does a very good job each day. The public areas are in good repair an clean and no foreign odors are evident. Personnel are friendly and responsive to request. Valet service is very good despite an apparently shortage of people. Only complaint would be the food quality in the Veranda. We have stayed on the strip at such places as Harrah's and Monte Carlo and aside from the differences in the physical plants, Four Queens is equal in service and personnel. We have and will recommend them to anyone interested.	
Oct 16 2008 	good as ever	the queens was as good as ever still the best place to stop downtown	
Oct 16 2008 	Great Casino	Could not ask for a better stay. Check-in took no more than five minutes. All hotel personnel were extremely friendly and helpful.Had a great time at the Four Queens.	
Oct 15 2008 	Can't wait to go back!!	The Four Queens was great! My husband and I had a wonderful time. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. We got in at 9:30 am and was able to check into a room right away. If you love video poker like we do, this is a great place to go. They have a huge selection plus lots of progressives, which by the way we hit one on our last day there. Ya Hoo!!! We will definitely be returning. Room service was good and fast and the pizza at the Chicago Brewery was delicious. We love the Fremont Street Experience and checked out some of the other casinos but did 99% of our play at the Four Queens. Do get a players card when get there. Their comp system is really good. We earned 3 free nights and are already planning our return visit. Thanks Four Queens! We will be back!	
Sep 19 2008 	fremont street best	Pleasant desk service gave me room on 18 floor with king bed as requested at the desk. everyone was friendly. room was standard but lovely and with enough space. view was excellent. clean, quick elevator service, and casino was fun with many waitresses offering free drinks.slots were good.ate breakfast at magnolia's and it was very good with a special players card discount. they also gave me a shirt and a tote bag.did eat breakfast buffet at golden nugget. highly recommend this.otherwise, four queens was the best and the best deal.will be back soon.	
Sep 12 2008 	a good price	We stayed here Sept 9th for about $35/night. Checked in at 4pm with no line. Front desk staff were very friendly.We were given a North Tower room. It was a long confusing walk from the front desk to our elevators. We were on the 9th floor and above the Fremont experience.Room was basic and clean. Although it was nice to have the flat screen TV, the room felt outdated. Internet is $8.99/day (paid $13.99 for internet at the Mirage). Parking $3/day. We ate at Mangolia's once since we got a free meal voucher for my husbands birthday from the Players Club. Also got some nice totes from joining the Club as well. Overall it was a cheap room downtown. We love staying downtown and usually stay at the Golden Nugget. Not sure if we will return to this hotel or go back to the Nugget.	
Sep 9 2008 	Worth waiting 25 years for......	We celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary with a stay at the Four Queens August 25-29. We had never been to Las Vegas before so we spent several weeks trying to decide where to stay. We decided to take a chance and stay at the Four Queens and we are so glad that we did. Every staff member that we spoke to was kind and considerate. Our room was very nice (standard with a king bed) and the veiw out our 14th floor window was spectacular!  We ate at Magnolia's Veranda 3 times. We found the food delicious and very reasonable, especailly when we used our player's cards. It was handy having a Subway located in the hotel and we were just a few steps away from a McDonalds. We took the Deuce to the strip twice but we liked the atmosphere on Fremont Street much better! We enjoyed our stay so much that we are planning on celebrating anniversary #26 at the Four Queens next year!	
Aug 25 2008 	Impressed for the what I paid for	I booked my room on hotels.com on a 50% discount. I paid $39 bucks a night for Friday and Saturday. At first I was &quot;oh great, you get what you pay for right&quot; Well I was very very impressed when I showed up. From the front door clerk which was very nice and actually let me check in at 8am, versus 4pm. That was a good sign. I finished checking in and went to my room and was very surprised that my room actually did not smell like feet, or smoke! Very clean rooms and modern. I stayed at other big name casinos and the rooms I had actually was similar to the rooms i paid $150 + at other casinos. Over all I had a good impression with this lil hotel casino. I think the only thing I could say negative was that was a bit of a distance from all the other big name casinos are, but a lil drive saved me a lot of loot! I thank trip advisor for helping me make my final decision on this hotel before I booked it.	
Aug 12 2008 	Viva 4 Queens!	Going to Vegas for our wedding, we decided to try the Four Queens, based largely on the reviews here. My new bride and I were definitely not disappointed! Our room in the South tower (12th Floor) was clean and comfortable, and room service very efficient. The hotel was ideally located for our needs. The &quot;Deuce&quot; (the bus that runs from downtown to the south end of the Strip) was just two blocks away and plenty of food choices and cheezy souvenir shops awaited right outside the doors. The food at Magnolia's at the 4 Queens was delicious, and if you join the Players' Club (it's free) you can get some nice discounts there, too. And of course you're right in the middle of the Fremont St. Experience. So unless you're trying to earn bragging rights by staying at the very overrated and overpriced big-name properties on the Strip, I'd highly recommend the Four Queens.	
Aug 5 2008 	Very Good Hotel - Great Value	My wife and I stayed at 4 Queens for 5 nights in April. We were on the 10th floor or so. The room we got was at the end of the hallway, but the walk from the elevator wasn't bad at all. The room was very clean and comfortable. Our view was over the Fremont Experience canopy on the Fitzgerald's side. I liked that the window opened a little bit to let some fresh air in. We were never in our room before midnight so I can't speak of the noise level from outside. The room did not have a safe so we used the safe deposit boxes at the front desk. This was convenient but I didn't like it being out the open so people could see how much money we were taking with us. If I stay downtown again, I'll definitely consider the 4 Queens.	
Aug 5 2008 	Book ahead of time!	This hotel was great though due to last minute booking we ended up in a tiny room definately sub standard. The room was very nice though too small. The hotel was very clean and all employees were very courteous and helpful.	
Jul 30 2008 	The Four Queens -- a great hand dealt	My wife and I usually stay on the Strip and felt we should give downtown a try this trip. We weren't interested in a pool scene or lap of luxury rooms for this stay -- we just needed a clean room to get a shower and good night sleep in. Four Queens definitely delivered. Situated in the heart of downtown on Fremont Street, you cannot beat this location to everything you may want. We arrived late evening and checked in immediately upon arrival. Room was clean, North Tower, and several floors above the Fremont Street Experience (18th). The room had a king size bed (soft and extremely comfortable), plasma tv, view of the mountains and several casinos, efficient air conditioning, and sufficient bathroom space (lower pressure water but did its job).We went down to the casino once we got situated to get a feel for the tables and slots. I will write a separate review for the casino and places we ate at another time and just mention everything briefly now. We had lunch at Rosemary's on Sahara Ave using their prix fixe coupon, and it was worth every penny. Although it is a bit of a hike by rental car or cab, do not miss out on this dining experience.We ventured to the Strip for only one night to see comedian Jim Gaffigan which was a great show at Mandalay Bay, but I realized why I loved the downtown area more -- simply a better group of people to be around and not the stuffy &quot;look at me - look at me&quot; types that seem to be more common at the Strip hotels.Downtown is also less congested with traffic and people and one can enjoy themselves more and not feel as confined as you would on the Strip. For me, you simply get more bang for your buck Downtown.We checked out several other casinos while staying downtown and were impressed with the friendliness of not only the people but the staff from the cashiers to the floor managers. We found we were more likely to get comped than any other experience we had previously on the Strip.Finally, we ate at Hugo's cellar at the Four Queens which was an amazing meal from beginning to end. I will review the overall experience seperately from this review.Overall, the room at the Four Queens is what it is, a room, as I am sure is the same for most of the hotels near Fremont Street. Check in was a cinch, check out was a breeze, the staff was excellent, there was a variety of food to choose from as well as the Chicago Brew Pub which had excellent hand-crafted beers on tap. My recommendation is this: if you are used to staying in suites and have that level of expectation, do not stay at the 4 Queens. If you want a younger crowd and a pool / club scene, do not stay at the 4 Queens. If you, for some reason, go to bed at 9pm every night, the noise from Fremont Street will keep you up, so don't stay downtown let alone at the Four Queens. However, if you want a relaxed atmosphere, have simple expectations, want to be able to have your money go a little farther, and have access to great restaurants and good people, then Four Queens is for you.	
Jul 23 2008 	Four Queens...my Vegas home away from home	I love staying at Four Queens. From the moment I was dropped at that wonderful Limo/Shuttle area, I felt &quot; there's no place like home&quot;. I stayed in the South Tower again this year but in a higher room #1541. I was happy with this room as it faced the canopy and had the mountains in the background. The elevators worked well, the drink service was good, and they had a few slots that I always enjoy. The real plus is Four Queens location. It is nestled between Golden Nugget , Binions, Fremont, and Fitz. Each of these is only steps away, not blocks.I love the pedestrian walkway under the canopy and I love all that neon blazing back at me. It makes me want to spin around and throw my &quot;gold hat&quot; in the air.Everything, that Fremont Street Experience has, is within a short walk, not a mile away. FSE offers the light show, live bands, the Saxophone Guy, motorcycle show, &quot;Spray Paint' artist, etc.The dining on FSE is very good and reasonable. With the FSE coupon, you can get 2-4-1 Buffets at Fremont and Main Street Station.I highly recommend a South Tower Room at Four Queens for anyone who wants a clean, quiet, and cheerful room. This hotel has a fun casino and good restaurants which are easy to visit even for people with walking problems	
Jul 22 2008 	OK but not great	Well I stay downtown in Vegas quite often and decided to give Four Queens a shot. The rate was great.Starting off, the parking garage is odd, you have to exit into an alley to get to the hotel check in. The check in people were friendly and the room was very nice, new furniture, a flat screen TV and clean bathroom. First strike against them was the loud pipes when the shower was being used. I mean LOUD! Gambling is always fun at the Queens. All the table people were friendly and even at the keno room the drinks came fast. Strike two was their comps aren't as easy to use. In other hotels you can use your players card at any restaurant to get free or discounted food. At the Four Queens you needed to wait for a host to give you restaurant comps. Hugos' Cellar is located in the Four Queens and is probably the best Downtown restaurant.The last strike was they charged for parking. I didn't pay for parking at either of the other downtown hotels I've stayed at.So It's back to Fitzgeralds for me. Though I'll continue to enjoy gambling at the Four Queens.	
Jul 21 2008 	It was very good	We have been to Las Vegas 8 times, and my husband and I decided to stay downtown for the first time this trip. We completely enjoyed our time at the Four Queens. The staff was friendly, courteous and extremely helpful. We arrived at 10 AM and were told they had a room ready for us immediately. We asked for the quietest room they could give us, and that is what we got. I had called ahead to make the request and the room they gave us was blissfully quiet. We never heard the noise from the Freemont Street Experience. Our room was clean, newly re-furbished, small and quite pleasant. The maid service was good. On check-in we requested a refrigerator for my husband's medication, and it was delivered within minutes to our room. Based on recommendations from here at Trip Adviser, we ate 3 times at the 4 Queen's Magnolia's Cafe. The food was fine, the service slow, and it was lit up like a bowling alley. But, it was easy and accessible and our breakfast at the 4 Queens was a 100% better than the breakfast we had at the tonier Golden Nugget down the street, and quite a bit less costly. At first we thought we might have made a mistake staying downtown. But, after taking the bus back and forth to the strip 2 times and dealing with the hassle and crowds on the strip, we realized that staying downtown was the way to go for a couple of middle-aged people who do not want to be around little children. There is nothing for children to do downtown other than see the laser light show at night. And, that is the only time we saw kids, at night, and not for long. All in all I would recommend the 4 Queens to anyone interested in coming to Las Vegas to gamble and not to those coming for the &quot;spa&quot; experience. The hotel does not have a pool or spa. But, downtown does have $5 blackjack all night, $2 roulette and a lot of loose slot machines. It was the first time in my 8 times in LV that I came back with more money than I took, and I won it all downtown.	
Jul 20 2008 	Traveler's with disability's	I am disabled and requested an accessible room. I was given a room in the south tower which was large enough to easily accomodate my wheelchair. The room was located close to an elevator that went directly to the casino.The bathroom was large but had a tub with a shower chair. Worked fine for me but some wheelchair users may find a roll in type shower easier (not sure if one is available here you'd have to ask).The hotel does not have wheelchairs on loan but the bell desk can direct you to a local vendor who will rent you one (manual or electric) and deliver it within an hour.Hotel was clean, and nicely appointed for an older property. I would definately stay here again. Downtown area is much easier to navigate than the Strip for people with limited mobility.	
Jul 15 2008	My favorite spot in Las Vegas	I just returned from Las Vegas after 4 nights at the Four Queens. The service is amazing and the staff are real nice. I would never stay anwhere else. They are also sensative to a handicapp persons needs and this always makes it easier when your spouse is handicapp. May you always have excellent service and never change the way you serve the customers.	
Jul 13 2008 	Perfect Stay at Four Queens!	As we've stayed on the strip before, we wanted to experience downtown. After doing ALOT of research - we decided on the Four Queens Hotel and we're so pleased with our decision. We got an amazing deal on Expedia ($28/night and then a $50 gas card). We stayed here for 3 nights.While it isn't your glitzy 5 star hotel - it has everything you need and was very comfortable. Our entire trip was extremely smooth - everything from our shuttle from the airport to our check-out at noon. We arrived at the hotel at 10:30 pm and there was no line up (unlike the strip hotels). Our room was exactly what we requested (king/non-smoking). The view wasn't the greatest but that's no big deal - I didn't request a room with a view. The air conditioning was fantastic - no problems. The bathroom is small but manageable and very clean. The housekeeping was great - everyday our room was cleaned. We requested extra pillows - no problem - received soon after requested. The bed was real comforable and the room size was great. The food at Magnolia's was great. Nice home cooked feeling there with very reasonable prices. Make sure to ask for the Funbook when you are checking in. The book has coupons for the hotel's services (meals, coffees, slot $, etc.). We took full advantage of the funbook and probably saved $50.00. The casino is also a great size. It has something for everyone. I really have no complaints about the Four Queens.The Fremont Street Experience was amazing. We never felt scared on the street and there were plenty of security around in case anything were to happen (we didn't see anything bad happen though). Even in 112 degree heat - it was comfortable because the entire street has the canopy that blocks the sun. We were thankful for this!!!Everything is right outside your door - McDonalds, Dunkin Donuts, Starbucks, Walgreens... We took the city bus to the Outlet Mall ($1.25/per person). Great place for shopping. We then cabbed it back to the Four Queens ($12.00 cab fare including tip).After staying downtown, I don't think we will be going back to the strip. We absolutely loved downtown and can't wait to go back. It is a different atmosphere where everyone is friendly and helpful. All ages here - from small babies to the elderly. We will definitely stay at the Four Queens again and would also like to try out the Fremont Hotel.If you are looking for a little more 'glitz' - you would probably like the Golden Nugget... but we did notice that the lobby always had a long line up of people checking in/out - and the pool was also very busy.Tip: Before you go - make sure to register online for the Four Queens players club - print it out and present it for a gift. We got a free duffle bag just for registering online!	
Jul 7 2008	medicwizz@yahoo.com	First let me say that I usually stay at 4 star plus hotels and resorts. This was a last minute decision due to the fact our travel agent booked us at the luxor which we found out 2 weeks before our departure was totally sold out! She then gave us a full refund thank God. So we wanted to try downtown. The four queens with air for seven days was 440.00 pp. on hotwire.The bad thing with hotwire is that you dont know your flights until you buy the trip, our flights were HORRIBLE!!!!! When we got there at 10:00 pm our check in took a total of 10 minutes and the desk clerk was very nice and helpful as to what perks/comps we could aquire and how. I requested a room in the south tower due to reading trip advisor reviews stating that it was newer and more updated. They gave us what I requested with no problem.The room was in comparison to a super 8 or comfort inn. It was very nice and clean.Decor was ugly but new. We stayed on the fourth floor in the south tower. There was absolutely no problem with elevaters and no wait to get one. When we exited the elevater we were right in the casino.The maid service was also very good. We had two queen size beds and they were very comfortable and they looked like new. We slept very well and was quite pleased. 32 inch flat screen tv was very nice. Our remote batteries were dead I called the front desk and had new batteries brought to me in 10 minutes.The air conditioning was perfect. The room was no smaller than any average size hotel room. The bathroom was small but was ok with the door closed, ha ha.The shower had good pressure and never a problem with hot water. One thing I didnt like is ,there was no exhaust fan , bathroom was very steamy until the door was opened. Good thing I was with my sister. (due to lack of privacy from door being opened.) Dealers were nice and friendly,Casino host was attittudy but helpful.Booze girls were terrible, Once at the slot machines I had no change for a tip and gave the girl a 50 cent token and she rolled her eyes and I never seen her again, and this was after tipping her a doller per drink for more than 2 hours! At the tables it was complete opposite they kept my glass full. The waitresses in Magnolias were terrible and all didnt care if you ate there or not. I tried to get a cup of soup to go one nite and they said all they had was styrofoam containers and she wouldnt put soup in it, so then I asked for a steak hogie to go and she said they didnt have hogies. So I showed her on the menu that I just looked at and she said &quot;thats a sub not a hogie&quot;? So I just left cause I was so mad at this point and went to the freemont and got chinese take out. Just to let the ladies know,, A bum attempted to rob me outside on freemont street in front of the fremont hotel and casino, but a bicycle cop seen him in action and arrested him approx. 2 am. This was right in front of four queens also and the casino cop seen this and voluntarily escorted me to my room when I returned to the casino.. For me I will absolutely stay here again , the price was right for what we got and we were very pleased.I do however think next time I visit , I will go with my hubby.	
Jul 5 2008 	4 Queens was great!	This was my first time staying downtown and the 4 Queens was great! I thought it was just beautiful and all of the staff were very friendly. I received the exact room that was requested (non-smoking, 2 beds, higher floor) and was very pleased with my accommodations. The room was very clean, did not show a lot of wear and had a nice flat screen T.V. The bathroom is very small, but was very clean and about the size of the one in my apartment so I was right at home. My only complaint, if I had to give one, would be that the water pressure in the shower was very low. Not a deal breaker for me, but you really had to rinse for a while to get the soap out of your hair. I booked through Expedia (I normally book direct with the hotel but got an unbelievable deal with Expedia, $28 a night plus $50 gas card!) and I just wanted to say that my room was great so I do not believe that you get the worst rooms available or the leftovers when you use travel sites (as I have often read many people state in trip reports or reviews). Housekeeping was very good and our room was always clean upon return. The elevators were quick and never crowded.We were in the north tower which is on the fremont side, we had no noise problems (12th floor) but if you are on a lower level I could see noise being a problem.Just a very nice stay, would book here again in a heartbeat!	
Jul 1 2008 	Really nice "stay-cation"	My recent 4 night stay at Four Queens was delightful. I thought, given that this is an older property in Vegas, that services might be short. To my pleasent surprise, everything was super. Particularly the friendly service of ALL the hotel employees. I'm now planning to make the hotel my place for stay-cation when going to Vegas.	
Jun 21 2008 	Good Value	I stayed here for Memorial Day Weekend, 2008 and enjoyed my stay. It is the perfect location to discover the Freemont Street Experience. My room was clean and spacious. I would stay here again.	
Jun 18 2008 	NICE 	We just got back from our trip to Las Vegas. This was our first time to stay on Fremont St. We chose the Four Queens because we heard it had just been remodeled and the rooms were nice. When we arrived, around 10 am, we were able to leave our bags in the baggage room until it was time to check in. We were exhausted so we came back around 2 pm to ask if maybe we could have our room early, but they said no. The girl at the front desk was kind of rude and said that there were no exceptions and check in was at 4 pm. We finally checked in at 4pm, and we were traveling with another couple, and asked to be put on the same floor. They said there were no other rooms on that floor, but the girl didn't even bother to check. We ended up on the 11th floor and they were on the 6th. After we checked in the bell clerk took forever to get our bags. He took our ticket for our bags, and then proceeded to ignore us as he started talking to another employee. Our room was very nice, no complaints there, everything was clean. Nice average room, with a nice plasma tv, but the bathroom was very small but clean. The bed was very comfortable and we loved the pillows. We had trouble with the sink, the water would not go down. It would take awhile to drain, we told the front desk but, they never did anything. No biggy we lived with it. We stayed in the south tower room #1149, nice quiet corner room, with a view of the mountains. Over all our stay was comfortable, the casino was nice, and the restaurants were decent. I would stay here again for the price, I would just make sure to get there at check in time.	
Jun 16 2008 	Decent place to stay	The room was fairly small but nicely furnished and clean. The king bed was very comfortable and the large flat panel TV was nice. The bathroom was really tiny and well worn...needs updating. The shower was very annoying as the water temerature wouldn't stay consistent for very long as constant adjustment was needed. The good thing was that it was also clean. We were in a room on the 7th floor facing Freemont St. The music from the street was quite loud, especially during the light shows but died down considerably after mid-night. We would go out each day and return late at night so the noise wasn't an issue. We only needed a place to shower and sleep for a few hours each night and for the bargain rate, clean room, the Four Queens fits the bill.	
Jun 9 2008 	Not that bad at all	My family needed a hotel for the Sunday night before Memorial Day. I only encountered very high prices for other properties and came upon the Four Queens for a $50.00 rate. We have not stayed downtown very often and decided to give it a try. Of course when arriving to the hotel Sunday evening downtown was jammed packed. The valet verified that we were going to be hotel guests and then was very helpful with directing us to the front desk. Check in was quick and easy. The room was very clean with a comfortable king size bed and had a nice 32-inch flat panel TV. I was very satisfied with my stay at the Four Queens and would definitely recommend it or stay there again. We did not experience any of the restaurants at the property. The staff that we encountered was very nice and polite. Not a bad way to start off our vacation. GOOD LUCK.	
Jun 7 2008 	A major complaint (not just the 4 Queens)	We stayed there only one night. After a week in Hawthorne for a funeral we thought we would at least get a look at the downtown, and the Fremont street Experience. That was the #1 thing on my list for this short stay. We arrived about 11:30 on Monday night. Went through the hassle of checking in, parking in the garage, and finding our way to our rooms on the 11th floor through some maze of elevators (I am disabled and probably should have used the valet service, next time). We got our stuff together (my brother and his new wife and two kids were there also) and headed down for the show. The last show was at midnight, so we waited with a lot of other folks for the show, no show. Later we heard that the sound was broken so they canceled it. Very disappointing, it should have been announced somehow, and this may be our last chance to see it. After this, things got even worse (on a dumb business decision level). The 4 Queens, and the other casino's downtown have their club card places only open from 8am to midnight. We played some, but not having players cards took quite a bit of the fun out of it. The hotel room was more than we really expected with what we payed for it, clean, spacious, and a great TV system. We then got checked out and went through the hassle of getting our cars, and leaving to catch an early (9:30) flight. All in all, not a great experience, it did not enthuse us to return there anytime soon. We will probably continue to travel to the midwest casinos rather that going to Vegas again.	
Jun 3 2008 	Very Bad Service...This place Sucks!	We just came back from a 2 night stay (Sunday-Tuesday) and I wish I would have never cheked in at this dump. I booked my stay through Expedia and requested a king bed, non smoking and a view of the Freemont Street Experience. What I ended up receiving was a king bed, smoking room with a beautiful view of their air conditioning experience! I complained, but all they told me was that they didn't have anything else available, even though I was checking in at 1:30P.M.. That was straight [-]! The room was smoky as hell, and we bought some air fresheners, but it didn't cure the problem. The parking is crappy at this place too. They want your tickets and too display their yellow piece of paper....Just problems every time I had to get the car out of the structure. The room was small, but duable. The t.v. was cool, but why have an LCD if you're not going to put the HD signal??The hotel is centrally located right in the middle of Freemont, and that was about the only good thing in this dump.I do have to say that the Magnolia Cafe is excellent. You know, before this experince I thought that the Plaza was the worst hotel I've stayed in, but this 4 Queens with their BAD service is what really got to me. Next time, I won't stay in a room if they tell me it's a smoking room, but at least let a person know ahead of time if their speacial requests will not be made. Because then whats the point of requesting anything if you guys don't pay attention to [-] anyways!!	
Jun 3 2008	Four Queens is the best!	Checked in on May 25th and checked out May 28th, check in was easy. The room was very nice and I love Magnolia's diner. I did request to move to a different room because I was right over the awning of the Fremont Experience and the music kept me up all night. They were very nice and changed my room immediately. So just a head's up be sure to ask for a room away from fremont street. The casino is fun and it was an all around good experience.	
Jun 3 2008 	Excellent choice on Fremont Street!	My girlfriend and I booked a long weekend stay at the Four Queens in a package deal through Allegiant Air. I called the Four Queens to upgrade our room to a Jacuzzi Suite. Telephone customer service was excellent.I was a little concerned about the potential quality of the hotel being that it is much older than the hotels on the Strip where I am used to staying.When we arrived, the front desk personnel were very friendly. I was pleasantly surprised with the Four Queens. We were in room 1002, on the 10th floor. Our windows were over the Fremont Street canopy, but view was not a concern for us. The room was nice and big, very clean and nicely appointed. The Jacuzzi tub was big and awesome! What a relaxing way to chill out before bed after a long day in Vegas. The water pressure in the shower was amazing. The only complaint I had about the room was that the mattress was a little hard. Otherwise, everything else about the room was great. The Four Queens was much cleaner and nicer than I had expected it to be.The food at Marigold's Cafe was excellent as was the food at the little deli in the casino. Be sure to get your club card for nice discounts on select meals at Marigold's. I would like to note that this was my best friend's very first trip to Las Vegas and she loved the Fremont Street experience!I will definitely be staying at the Four Queens again! :)	
May 29 2008	4 Queens Casino fun location	Stayed at the 4 queens from May 23-26, 2008. Received an offer for three free nights and a free slot tournament. Rented a car for 4 days for $99.00. I highly recommend renting a car if you don't mind driving in heavy traffic. Really gives you a chance to go and check out other places . I own a Tom Tom travel unit and it really makes it stress free going from one address to another. Arrived at the hotel around 1 pm and even though check in wasn't supposed to be till 3 pm there was no problem getting a room. I had asked for room above the Fremont street light show and was put up on the 15th floor. If you are bothered by loud noises, I highly recommend that you get above the 10 th floor and ask for a room facing away from the Fremont street experience. ( You will sleep much better) The room while not large was fine, two queen beds and a small tub and shower. While I didn't win slot tournament it was fun. The casino was not smoky as I have read from other guests comments. It was busy and yet you could find a 5 dollar black jack table if you wanted. Lots of machines to play and they paid out as good as any. I will come back again.	
May 28 2008 	We Loved the Four Queens	DH and I stayed at the Four Queens from May 20 to the 27th. Check in was a breeze. I requested a refrigerator and it arrived to the room before we did. We had a corner room on the 17th floor facing Fremont. The view was excellent. The room was nice and clean and maid service was wonderful. Everyday they came in and cleaned and left more and more little shampoos and etc......Magnolis was great as well. Everyone we met were very friendly and I will definitely stay there again. Great bargain. They do not have safes in the rooms, however, for no charge we used the deposit boxes at the front desk and we had access 24/7	
May 28 2008 	Its a good place to stay	Rooms are on the small size compared to the Golden Nugget but are clean and have a 32&quot; lcd tv. Bathrooms are smaller in size. Everything was fine during our two day stay. I would stay here again.	
May 24 2008 	A Different Vegas...	Weve been going to Las Vegas every other April for almost 20 years. Each time we go we stay somewhere different; the Strip, Boulder Hwy, Blue Diamond, North Vegas, Henderson, and so on. This time it was Fremont Street Downtown. After considering room rates balanced with Trip Advisor reviews, and location, we decided on the Four Queens for a 3 night (Tues - Thur) stay. We booked 2 rooms via internet thru the 4Qs website; 1 non-smoking king and 1 smoking double (for our 2 adult daughters). We arrived Tues about 5:30pm. Check-in was quick and the rooms were ready. First let me say that if you are comfortable with DIs, M6s, or S8s , you should be comfortable with the 4Qs. Nothing special, jut a clean, comfortable, recently refurbished room, South Tower - 7th floor. Typically sized (as per above), non-smoking king (not a hint of smoke smell), was located on the northeast corner of the bldg, overlooking the Fremont St Experience and the live music stage. And yes, the live music was LOUD, but they quit at 10pm. The FSE went until midnight but we barely heard it. Yes were older folks, but we dont go to Vegas to go to bed at 9:00pm either The bed was quite comfortable, the 32 TV nice, and housekeeping worked around our late mornings just fine. The girlies had a smoking twin on 3rd floor South Tower overlooking the HVAC. They had no problems and were quite pleased with it considering Daddy paid for itAs for food, we passed on Hugos, but the Magnolias Restaurant (for breakfast) was on a par with a good truck stop, meaning the prices were affordable, the service acceptable, and the food tasty, hot, and plentiful. The Chicago Brewing Co. had fairly good beer, so if youre a serious beer drinker, by all means give it a try. For dinner we did Paradise Buffet (Fremont), 3/10 (poor), The Buffet (Golden Nugget) 7/10 (quite good), and The Pullman Grill (Main Street Station) 9/10 (excellent). The Triple 7 brew pub at Main Street Station also had several very good beers!The 4Qs casino was midsized and not very busy! The air was breathable but cool! Unless you were right next to Smoking Man, the smoke level was acceptable. As for gaming, the wife did her usual feeding the penny and nickel slots while I looked for camaraderie and revelry at the crap table. What I found was the crap tables virtually empty at 10pm. I ended up going across the way to the Fremont for several hours. Still though, Ive never seen Vegas casinos so quiet and sparsely populated. Several of the street vendors I talked to also said business was off. I guess the economy has a lot of folks worried.Lastly, kudos to housekeeping and maintenance. We received extra pillows and towels within minutes of our request. Secondly when we returned from dinner about 9pm Tues the room was about 90 degrees. After a call to the front desk we went back out. When we returned about midnight, there was a weve been here note on the door from maintenance and the room temp was about 65. Good show guys!We stay somewhere different each time we go to Vegas, so its not fair to say whether or not we would stay here again. The 4Qs is what it is - an inexpensive alternative to the high priced (over-priced?) accommodations on the Strip. We enjoyed Downtown. Its definitely a different Vegas!	
May 20 2008 	Four Queens did not dissapoint!	Stayed this year at the Four Queens for the first time. Check-in was a breeze and the staff was very friendly. We requested a room that overlooked the FSE and under the canopy- This proved to be a mistake on our part as we didnt realize that the music plays 24/7!! Found out that we were lighter sleepers than we knew!! No worries though as the room was small but really nice with newer carpet and a great LCD flat TV. Bath was small too, but looked as though it had been recently updated and was very clean, We really enjoyed the Chicago Brew pub and thought thier micros were fantastic. Magnolias was wonderful as usual too. Overall, we would stay here again if it were in the cooler months where you wouldnt use a pool. I really missed not having a pool to use. I would also get a room FAR from the FSE so I could sleep at night !! I would definitlely reccomend the 4Q's to anyone looking for a nice place to stay downtown if a pool was of no importance.	
May 14 2008 	Not one single complaint....	We go to Vegas a couple times a year and have stayed at all sorts of places. I find it ridiculous to spend a small fortune so I always look for a deal. We decided to stay on Fremont Street for the first time. It was GREAT! The hotel is right smack in the middle and close to lots of fun. Check in was fast and painless. We got a room on the 14th floor facing Fremont St. Although in the night we could sort of hear the music outside it did not prevent us from sleeping. Ask for the south tower if you are bothered by this. The room was nice. Bathroom was small and has yet to be updated but everything was CLEAN! The employees were nice and helpful especially at the roulette table. Rafael was friendly and answered all my questions even though I was not playing. The slots are looser than on the strip and I always finished the night ahead of what I started with. The have a wonderful casual dining place, Magnolia's where you can get a prime rib dinner 24/7 for $6.95 with a player's club card. If you want a buffet though go down the street to Main Street station for a great and inexpensive buffet. All and all this was my favorite trip to Vegas for numerous reasons with The Four Queens being one of them. We will go again and I will recommend it to others.	
May 6 2008 	Good hotel if you sleep like a log	When in Vegas, I usually stay at or near the Strip. Enjoyed spending time Downtown, because of how close everything is, and decided to give it a try. Reserved a Non-Smoking room for Thursday through Sunday nights (4 nights).The room was fine, clean, newer carpeting, and relatively fresh paint. Bathroom fixtures were old, dated, and showed signs of wear, but clean. Hard foam pillows were all that were available (OK, I'm a little spoiled with hotels having both foam and feather pillows). Saw somewhere on their web site that rooms had in-room safes ... but couldn't fine one. I called down, and they said only smoking rooms had in-room safes. Couldn't believe my ears (perhaps they had to put their cigarettes in the safe?), so I went down to ask, and was told that ony the suites had in room safes, but could talk to Security for some sort of secured locker in another part of the building (I think they said in the basement). Now that seems convenient for someone who travels with a laptop or other valuables (not).I got a room on the 12th floor, facing Fremont Street, which I thought was great ... nice views and all ... until the music kept playing until 4am ... and then VERY LOUD PA announcements began at 8am, and kept repeating every 5 minutes. I considered checking out after the lack of a room safe (and thought I'd give them another chance), then again after a restless night ... but I really wanted to like staying downtown. After the second night, I decided to get out of there, and found another hotel near the strip for about 20% more in cost. Much much nicer, with a room safe too :)I don't know if staying in one of their other towers would have been nicer. If you do stay here, I'd suggest you forgo the views and get a room off Fremont Street.	
May 4 2008 	Great Value for the Money	My husband and I recently stayed four nights at the Four Queens. We love staying in downtown Las Vegas and have stayed at several other properties. The room at the Four Queens was comparable to some of the others. However, if you are looking for the upscale quality of the &quot;mega&quot; resorts, this is probably not the place for you. The room was average. I loved the coffee pot in the room. Surprisingly, the bed was one of the most comfortable hotel beds I've ever slept in. The fan to the air conditioning was pretty noisy. You would have to turn up the volume on the TV when the A/C came on. One complaint I had was that the selection of television channels was pretty limited. There were no movies channels like HBO. I became ill and had to spend one whole day in the room. I had to watch CNN or sports most of the day. The staff at the Four Queens was great. Everyone we encountered was very friendly. The pit crew and dealers were nice. (Thanks Robb and Mr. IL). The front desk staff were very quick at check in. The valets were very polite and efficient.We had a great breakfast at Magnolia's. You get a great deal on breakfast with your players card. It's $4.95 for a huge breakfast including coffee. The food was good. We also had a sandwich from the deli. It was really good but a bit pricey. For sandwiches, chips and drinks for two people it was almost $20.My husband and I have decided we will be staying at Four Queens again. It is a great value for the price.	
May 2 2008 	Great Experience!	Our first experience at the Four Queens won't be our last. We had a great time while in Las Vegas thanks to the staff and Management of this great hotel. Our Non Smoking room was clean every day and never had an odor of prior sneaky smokers. The price was right from Saturday through Wednesday and the atmosphere was exactly what we had come to expect from previous experience staying downtown. There were $5 Craps and Blackjack tables most of the time if not all of the time. (I usually gamble in the early morning hours after the late night crowds have left) The Roulette tables had some of the best minimums in Downtown. PaiGow minimum was $10 most of our visit. I don't know how loose the slots were since I seldom play them unless I am killing time. Our 8th floor hotel room door was about 50 feet from the Elevator (North Tower) and maybe another 30 to the Freemont St. Experience once you step off the elevator. We had drinks several times late in the evening at the Chicago Brewing Company while we played Video Poker. Overall, we found the bartenders, wait staff, dealers, and front desk personnel to be very polite and courteous. In the future I will contact the Hotel directly for reservations because of a goof up by Travelocity who ended up having to resend our confirmed reservation via Fax. ( I had called the day earlier to confirm our reservations at the hotel) I'm glad I did. I will recommend the Four Queens to my friends because it is right in the middle of downtown, has a great covered parking area which is free for guests, and because of it's value.	
Apr 29 2008 	Nice hotel for a nice price	I stayed at the Four Queens after my plane was delayed. It was a nice hotel with a matching &quot;nice&quot; price, even for the weekend and late notice I got a great deal. The hotel is clean, located right on Freemont Street, they have room service, internet access and in-house restaurants and casino. It is not the best hotel downtown, but is defintely not shabby and is clean. The service staff is helpful and smiling. Had a nice stay.	
Apr 26 2008 	Cheap Price Thats All.	The overall experience was O.K. the hotel not very nice by any means, nice meaning fancy. if you can afford better do it. Just very plain, pretty clean but plain. If this hotel was not around so much entertainment, Motel 6 would be better. We chose 4 Queens for Fremont Street and the price. It seems like alot of the attitude that you get from employees in this area is from not getting paid as much as up on the Strip I can only assume. This was the first time I have stayed downtown and would have to say that if I stayed again it wouldn't be at 4 Queens would have booked the Golden Nugget.  The casino was OK small but fun, there is nothing else to do here no entertainment in the hotel, not a problem though since Fremont Street is right outside. The hotel staff was not very friendly at all, needed directions to clerks office to get a marriage license, they sent us in the wrong direction 4 blocks, if you are familiar with downtown you know you don't want to be wandering around at 1:00 AM, very shady characters in that area, don't wander off Fremont Street after dark. After going back to the hotel to let them know their little map and directions they gave were wrong, they didn't even say sorry or offer to get us a taxi to take us or nothing. No compassion for the anxious pre-marriage couple. Paid a Taxi $20 to take us 4 blocks in the opposite direction we was sent, was happy to pay considering the uncertainty of the area the clerks office was in. All in all the vacation was pretty much what I had anticipated for the price. If budget is what you want 4 Queens is fine. If your wanting the excitement you see on TV fancy fancy stay on the Strip in a more upscale hotel.	
Apr 21 2008 	decent hotel	I checked in at 11am and my room was ready. Staff were friendly and efficient. The location of the hotel is great for seeing the downtown area. The casino is large and has a good selection of games. The elevators to the rooms are nearby and easy to find. The room was basic and comfortable -nothing special. I ate dinner at Magnolias and it was just okay. If you get a good price and just need a basic room near it all...this hotel will be fine.	
Apr 20 2008 	Disppointed	My husband and I just returned from a short stay at the Four Queens. We normally stay at the Golden Nugget if we're going to be in the downtown area but after reading many positive reviews and comparing prices we decided to try this property. Check in was fast and effecient. Our room was a queen overlooking Fremont Street. The room was one of the smallest I've ever stayed in. It looked like it had been recently painted and refurbished but age was still evident throughout the room. The view was the top of the giant LCD screen from the Fremont Street Experience which is basically blocks of curved metal. The hotel doesn't have a pool or a buffet. We walked across the street for dinner. While playing slots we were never once approached and offered drinks in approximately 6 hours of play. I finally went to one of the bars to order drinks and there was one bartender trying to serve at least 20 customers and after waiting for 15 minutes for him to get to me I finally gave up and walked to another casino to get our drinks. The worst part of the stay was bedtime. We got to our room about 11:00 PM and were exhausted and there was a live band playing on the street below and the crowd was screaming. It was so loud there was no way we could sleep until the band stopped playing. Although the experience wasn't all bad, the size of the room and the noise factor will probably keep me from staying there again.	
Apr 13 2008 	Wanted to like it!	The past couple times in Vegas, I stayed at the Strat. this time I tried The four Queens because I got the room cheap . Went to check in at 10am, and they told me that I could come back at 1pm. So we came back at 1 and they said that we could put our bags in the room, but it hadn't been cleaned yet, I figured cool at least they are letting us do that. So my first thoughts on this room were, hey this isen'y bad at all. The main room looked very basic, but very clean. The bathroom was small, and looked like it hadn't been re done like the rest. Then I though, man, its kind of warm in here. So, in the morning they had a coffee maker which was nice, then we were off for the day. When I returned that night, I thought, that they did a good job cleaning up the room, then I went to snuggle in bed and I pulled the spread back and notice that there was little blood spots on the sheet, right by where someones face would be, and I know, that I didn't bleed any place on my face, then I looked at the pillow, and there was a little bit on there too, I was grossed out pretty bad, so I ripped every thing off, and used the other beds sheets etc. cause I knew that no one could clean it now, it was 1am. So, off to sleep I went with a shirt of mine on top the pillow and full clothes on, so in the am. I knew that house keeping would do the beds and sheets and everything, WRONG!!! I left a note and 2 dollars requesting the sheets to be changed, NO CHANGE! Anyway I will not be staying downtown ever again, I guess that I am spoiled and used to clean sheets an a cool room and shower heads that don't fall off, call me crazy, but for the extra 40$ per night, I will stay somewhere on the strip! Magnolia's was great, and so was the buffet at the Freemont, but the Nugget buffet was a rip off!	
Apr 13 2008	Better than other downtown hotels	I loved my stay. I frequent downtown Las Vegas with my family about 4x a year. I have stayed at Fitzgerald and Binions but never Four Queens. This time around the price was reasonable so we books 3 rooms for a week at four queens. We were right next to the elevator. Everyone was nice. The only problems I would say with the hotel would be the long lines at the Royal Players club line. There was a rude employee in the gift shop and the hostess was a bit rude as well. Overall a great stay. Rooms are far better than Binions! Words of advice. Don't book with outside vendors (travelocity, travelworm etc). Book with the casino! Because even though it might be more, when you checkout show them your Royal Club card and you will get a discount rate of about 35$ a day! Instead of 50! You need to play at the casino and use your players card! Theyll comp your room.	
Apr 11 2008 	Great stay!	Went to the front desk on a Sunday morning around 11am expecting to be turned away until 4pm. The room we booked (standard) was not ready, but after inquiring, was upgraded to a suite in the South tower. Very large room with two couches, table, desk, comfortable bed and adequately sized bathroom. Large flat screen TV, but we never turned it on. Hotel staff provided excellent service (be sure to tip the front desk clerk in appreciation for the work they do on your behalf). If you play table games, be sure to stay on the pit crew about rating your play if you expect to be comped properly. We checked with the casino host after two days of play, and found that we had been significantly under-rated for our level of play. The host spoke with the pit management, and we were properly rated for the remainder of our trip. Overall, a great stay, and will be going back again!	
Apr 8 2008 	Fabulous time	I recently stayed at the Four Queens in Vegas and found this to be the best vacation to vegas yet!!! I've always stayed on the strip before and was hesitant to stay downtown but to my surprise it was fabulous! At the Four Queens the rooms were clean, maid service was fantastic, check in counter was fast and friendly, gaming table personal friendly and helpful and food at Magnolias just as good as three times the price on the strip! I will book my next stay at the Four Queens. Even the cashiers in the cage were friendly! I could not tell you a bad thing about the Four Queens. The view was also fantastic of the strip and mountains.	
Apr 6 2008 	Great first stay at the 4-Q	We decided to stay downtown for the first time this trip (usually stay on the strip). We checked all the hotels/rates and the Four Queens seemed to be what we were looking for, both in location and price, so I called and booked for 4 nights . The we actually got a postcard in the mail offering us 3 nights free so called and they said we could apply this and then pay $35 for the 4th night, which was great! Our flight got messed up and we ended up taking a flight a day earlier, putting us into Vegas on a Sat. late afternoon and many properties do not allow Sat. checkins. So I called and was told we could definitely get a room for Sat. night at a rate of only $49. We found them extremely accommodating. Loved the location. Magnolias was good food. Also an ice cream place upstairs and you can sit there on stools and look down onto the playing floor. We will definitely stay there again as downtown has become our new favorite spot!!	
Apr 1 2008 	Comfortable stay	My parents, husband and myself all stayed here on our Vegas trip. We booked our stay as part of a package deal combining flight, car and hotel. The first night we were split up on separate floors, my husband and I on the fourth floor, my parents on the fourteenth. The front desk clerk told us that we could move the next day if we wished. We were moved to the fourteenth floor the next day. Despite that floor being a smoking floor (and being a non-smoker), I never noticed any smoky smell.Our bed was so comfortable, and the new plasma screen tv's are really a nice amenity. While the bathroom and room were a bit small it certainly didn't matter as we were hardly in our room. I did notice the doors on that floor for some reason would shut loudly no matter how gingerly you closed them. We didn't have that problem on the fourth floor. Other than that, it was quiet.We dined at Magnolia's Veranda, one of the casino's restaurant's. I had the muffaletta, while everyone else took advantage of the prime rib special. I highly recommend the muffaletta. It was a huge sandwich and was made very well. My husband tried to large beer sampler. It was 9 different beers in mini mugs on a lazy susan. You could try a little of everything. I was pleasantly surprised at the price of the sampler at less than 8 dollars.The hotel's casino opens right onto Fremont Street which is really nice. It was so easy to just walk right out and be in the middle of the action.If I come back to Vegas, I will consider staying at the Four Queens again.	
Mar 31 2008 	Four Queens gets five stars	Booked this trip 10 weeks in advance thru Travelocity. Each time I contacted the hotel, they still didn't have the paperwork from Travelocity. 10 days prior to trip, called Travelocity for the 3rd time to tell them paperwork was not received by hotel. Was told AGAIN by Travelocity they were faxing paperwork. Upon check-in on March 27th, hotel still didn't have the paperwork. The front desk clerk at the Four Queens wrangled with Travelocity for over 2 hours to get the necessary paperwork for my stay. The hotel itself has beautiful rooms with extra soft beds and large flat panel tv's. The exemplary customer service I received from the hotel front desk staff will make me a repeat customer, but I'll deal directly with the hotel, and will NEVER use Travelocity again. This experience could have ruined my vacation, but because the Four Queens staff intervened, my stay was wonderful. I highly recommend this hotel, but book it directly.	
Mar 25 2008	Great Place	First time at the 4 queens. Best kept secret in Vegas. Loved this hotel. Spacious rooms, nice decor. Have stayed at some of the best and I am going back to 4 Queens. Fun, Fun, Fun. RIght on Freemont, where you really want to be. Fun table games, slots were great. People were super. Couldn't have asked for anything more. Food was great...Service top notch. I was totally surprised. Thanks 4 Queens for making my March getaway-great! See ya soon! Judy Cumming Ga.	
Mar 24 2008 	Fuor Stars for Four Queens	Stayed 2 nights and had a GREAT time. We traveled with 3 small children and used the 4Q based on Price and Location. The Hotel was immaculately clean. It is in the Fremont Street section and everything is litterally outside the doors! Despite it being an older property, it showed NO signs of age. The check-in was a snap, parking a breaze and navigating the place was simple. We had to walk through the Casino to get outside and the air quality inside the Casino was actually cleaner than the air on Fremont Street. Could not beat the Value!!!	
Mar 24 2008 	Best Place Downtown	We took our father to Vegas in 2007 and stayed at the Stratasphere and the Four Queens by far outdid our stay there. I can't begin to tell you how happy we all were. We had two rooms both on the top floor. The evelvators were very quick (never had to wait). Since it was Super Bowl Weekend we had to wait for everything, but the elevators and I don't mean at the Four Queens. Everyone that worked there was so helpful and always happy and had a smile of their face. Myself I usually have trouble sleeping in hotel beds, but not here they were so comfortable I slept like a baby and since I have had hip surgery on both hips that is saying alot. When the travel agent booked the Four Queens I was a little nervous because I had read some of the reviews and some of the most common complaints I saw were un-comfortable beds and slow elevators, but I am happy to say they were wrong on both accounts. We really enjoyed playing the slots, but I must say they did seem a little looser AFTER the Super Bowl. Again, there were 4 of us and all 4 would HIGHLY reccommend the Four Queens - as we have been doing since our return home. We do plan on coming back to Vegas again and I can assure you we will be staying at the Four Queens every time from now on. Thanks for a great experience!!!!Karen - Vicki - Steve &amp; Ray from Indiana	
Mar 22 2008 	Great Room - So-So Service	My previous trip to Vegas I stayed at the Golden Nugget so I was curious to see the difference between both hotels. In overall luxury (so to speak) the GN tops the 4 queens based on decor and general layout of the front desk. Four queens isn't as flashy but still nice nonetheless.I read reviews here (tripadvisor) and looked at room pictures before I booked and found both very helpful. I've rated my &quot;overall experience&quot; as above average simply because I really enjoyed the room I was in. I wanted something romantic and roomy because I'd be spending a lot of time in there ;). I was lucky to find a great deal online after many hours of research. I booked a petite suite which I got for $400 total for 3 nights (basically got a free night's stay as their prices are $200 per night). The room was huge and gorgeous with big windows, black leather couch (comfy!!), wetbar/mini fridge/sink, flatscreen tv, desk...more chairs in living area...it was well worth my $400. I also found the bed very big and comfy, my guy thought it was a little too soft for his taste but that didn't stop him from snoring in my ears all night. The bathroom was spacious enough with two sinks in a marble counter but nothing extra fancy for a suite.One problem with the room was the AC/Heating. Every time the stupid thing would turn off, both of us would jump from the noise. It would be loud and also sounded like someone was coming in the room. But it made us laugh every single time so we didn't make a big deal out of it.What I didn't like during my stay was a mix between the service/rudeness of staff. Upon check in I was told they didn't have a room for me because they were overbooked. What the heck is that all about?? After some spitting, I was able to get my room, which was a STANDARD!! I call down to the lady to say I booked a suite and her response was &quot;but I told you we're overbooked, I don't have that room for you.&quot; My response: I paid for it so you better get me it. I was FINALLY able to get my suite, though non-smoking when I booked a smoking room. I said to hell with it and smoked in the room throughout my stay anyways.When I'd order room service I always felt like I was bugging people. When they brought the food up they were always in a rush and barely smiling...so much for that %17 included gratuity fee.I had a late flight that night so after I checked out I gave my bags to the Bell Desk to hold on to until I left. By god, you'd swear I was asking the world of him. I still gave him $5 tip for the EFFORT he put into it....and just because I'm not cheap. I WILL say that the dealers at the table and floor management people were extremely nice and funny and made my gambling time more enjoyable.Casino: Nice casino but they're all very similar.Comps: Unless they mail me special offers or free nights stay, the comps are pretty bad. You have to spend tons of money to get anything. If you're an average to low gambler, it's useless. I still suggest you get a players card made because you never know.Would I stay again at Four Queens? I guess it would depend on the Golden Nugget's rates. If the GN is more expensive then yeah I would...but for 20 bucks more a night I'd probably choose the GN over Four Queens.	
Mar 21 2008 	Four Queens Hospitality	Anyone planning a trip to Las Vegas and likes the laid back feel of Fremont Street should give the Four Queens a try. We have stayed several times and cannot find a better hotel anywhere. In March 2008 we came for the Nascar race. We had actually booked through a travel agent this time (always used Expedia prior) because he was a friend of a friend. We did not stay at the Four Queens. However, when we were due to leave, a blizzard hit our hometown of Columbus, OH and we knew we would have to stay in Vegas a couple more days. We immediately headed for the Four Queens and was given a room for two nights stay complaints of the Four Queens. We will never stay anywhere else again as my wife and I agree. No one can match the Four Queens for the friendly atmosphere, excellent service, great food and so many other reasons. When we stayed at the Four Queens for the Nascar race in March of 2007, my wife became seriously ill and had to be transported to an emergency room. Security was swift to respond and helped me deal with a bad situation. My wife was ill enough that we were not able to depart as scheduled. The management at the Four Queens said stay in your room as long as necessary which turned out to be five extra days. I cannot believe after that I even considered staying anywhere else in 2008. I know we never will again. Try the Four Queens. YOU WON'T BE SORRY!!!!!! Larry &amp; Vicki Doles, Columbus, OH	
Mar 14 2008 	perfect location in downtown LV by the "Freemont Experience"	We stayed there twice in one month. We needed an inexpensive hotel that was close to our destination. We don't gamble, so all I can say about the casino is that there is one. The elevators are fast. The housekeeping staff consistantly does things that appear to be destructive to the hotel. Both stays, different rooms, different floors: the housekeepers unplugged the bedside lamps. So each night, my husband had to pull the bed away from the wall in order to plug the lamps back in. Not enough electrical outlets. The shower tiles in one room were a lovely pink; but marred by black gunk in the grout towards the ceiling. A water faucet kept dripping. The hotel appears to have spent a lot on renovating. But the hotel needs to take a hard, cold look at its housekeeping staff. The Magnolia restaurant is ok, and you can sit at tables that overlook the casino.The lobby opens into the casino. The casino leads to the Freemont Experience. We enjoyed the free night-time entertainment: the four block long video screen, the band, several artists painting in various kiosks, the shops,and the jewelry vendors. We will definitely stay downtown again next trip, but we may look at the other hotels.	
Mar 13 2008 	WOULD STAY AGAIN	Nice stay overall.Quick check in/out.Helpful staff.Housekeeping responded quickly to requests.Nice rooms though bathroom small but who spends much time there anyway.I always have trouble sleeping in hotel beds but not here..very comfortable.We were on the 17th floor and were impressed with the quick elevators..Magnolias restaurant had some excellent deals if you have a players card..good size portions and tastey!!!Casino slot machines were very tight not just here but everywhere..be sure to bring plenty of cash if thats your thing.Utilize the deuce bus for transportation..only $5 for 24 hours.Pickup only a few blocks and the deuce comes quite often and sometimes back to back.Be sure to reserve your airport shuttle the day before departure..Only issue was the a/c seemed to be turned off daily 1200-400 not an issue at this time of year but could be during hot season...	
Mar 10 2008 	Great staff food and services!	I have been staying at the Four Queens since Lady Luck closed. I have yet to be disappointed with the service, friendliness of staff, or room cleanliness. The rates are great and so is the hotel.	
Mar 9 2008 	Great Downtown Hotel	We loved this hotel and its central downtown location which is perfect for seeing the Fremont Street Experience. There is only a short walk from the parking garage to the check-in desk, and then to a room. The parking is free to hotel guests, with a validation given at check-in. We don't agree about the small room size we have read about in other reviews, our room with two beds was of average size and although the bath was smallish it was well laid out. The hotel was tastefully renovated in 2007, it was very clean and new-looking and the beds were comfortable. Unlike many Las Vegas hotels, our room had a coffee maker and a flat screen TV. We liked the many reasonably-priced food choices within the hotel. Don't stay here if you want to be on the strip, because the downtown is a different area. We like both, and we usually divide our visit between a strip hotel and a downtown hotel because both areas have a lot to offer.	
Mar 6 2008 	Great comfortable room in heart of downtown Vegas	Clean, comfortable, safe, and centrally located for the Fremont Street scene, the Four Queens is a smart choice for anyone looking for an affordable casino hotel. Housekeeping is conscientious and the newer furnishings include 32&quot; HD televisions. It's funny to think of a 200-room hotel as &quot;small&quot; but the Four Queens felt cozier than the other gargantuan casino properties. It's next door to the Golden Nugget and across the street from Binion's Horseshoe, so there's plenty of action nearby. I used to visit Las Vegas frequently twelve years ago, and back then I would stay at the Stardust because it offered me the same combination of affordability and amenities. Sadly, the Stardust is now gone and the enormous super-casinos are rapidly devouring the Strip. Downtown has changed little, so I appreciate the nostalgia and authenticity of Fremont Street. I'll make a return trip to the Four Queens.	
Mar 1 2008 	Feb 24 thru 29	I am very happy with our stay. People here were so nice from the time we checked out til the time we left.From the time we walked in the hotel til we got to our room was less than 20 minutes.Rooms were on the small side, but nothing I didn't expect. I was very satisfied, no problems with the rooms, extremely good water pressure.We stayed in room 1607 with an outside view, beautiful view at night or in the day. Perfect view of the strat.Can't forget the flat screen TV.We did have a smoking room, but you couldn't tell, no stale smoke smell.No in room safe but they do have safety deposit boxes at the front desk free of charge, which we took advantage of.There was one episode where I forgot my camera in the bathroom, didn't realize it for 30 minutes but lo and behold the bathroom attendant found it and returned it to security, I was so happy. I am so glad I just happened to tip this attendant. I think she would have turned it in anyway.The only complaint I have is that we stayed for 5 nights and gambled there every night. There was 3 of us and we gambled an average of $1000 a night between us and we did not get anything comped on our room. But as far as hotel review, Excellent.	
Feb 25 2008	great place to stay	when looking for a hotel in vegas, i searched price, location, and read the reviews from other travelers. i can't say enough about this place. my husband and i went on a getaway, this place is clean, spacious, and priced right. i thought the price was low and what kind of place am i getting into. It was perfect. i will definiately stay here again. the prices of food are also cheaper down here on freemont street.	
Feb 18 2008 	Loved it! Will go back	We booked a Vegas package through Cheaptrips and hit the jackpot! We got a smooth nonstop from Seattle to Vegas, and had a wonderful time at the Four Queens. We were on the 5th floor, North Tower, overlooking the Fremont Experience sign. Odd numbered rooms face the experience, even numbers are farther away from the experience nightly activity. Even being so close, we could barely hear the experience and crowds at night. The room was nicely furnished and clean. Nothing extravagant, but we didn't need that. The bathroom wasn't palatial, but didn't need that either. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We ate breakfast at Magnolia's every morning (open 24/7), and the food was delicious, and hot! We had a special dinner at Hugo's and the food and service was exceptional. It was costly, but worth every penny. Wonderful salad prepared especially for each person at your table. Gambling: we just hit the slots, which were a bit more loose Fri-Sun. Nice variety of slots. The cashiers were fun if you talk with them. We've been going to Vegas and staying on the strip for years. We like staying downtown. It's a shorter distance to the various casinos, smaller crowds, friendlier casino staff, looser slots. If you're the younger generation, love the glitz and noise of the strip, downtown isn't for you! We just took a taxi ride to the strip to see our booked shows.	
Feb 16 2008	loved it	It was everthing they said it was. Great room, newly remodeled friendly staff, great food . Been to Vegas 10+ times this is one of if not the best stay. Loved downtown. Not just saying this because we won. we did'nt. The comps for playing are second to none. Will be back at the Queens.	
Feb 14 2008 	OK but noisy 	Although the staff members were all very courteous, our stay at the Four Queens was frustrating in a few ways. For one thing, many of the hotel's rooms face Fremont Street, which features loud bursts of music every half hour between 7 p.m. and midnight, every night. If you are an early to bed type or are bringing young children, either request a room that is as far from Fremont Street as possible, or just don't stay at this hotel. In addition to the noise, downsides included the fact that you have to weave through the incredibly smoky casino to get to the hotel's restaurants; the fact that there is no pool or hot tub or anything at all to do at the hotel if you want to take a break from gambling; and the fact that after we moved to a new room, the tub faucet leaked all night and the room smelled of smoke even though it was a non-smoking room. On the plus side, their Magnolia's restaurant had good food, and the light show at the Fremont Street Experience is fun.A big issue to consider is the general location of the hotel. If you aren't familiar with Vegas, please note that the Four Queens is nowhere near the more famous and fabulous hotel/casinos such as the Bellagio, Venetian, Luxor, and Paris. To get to them, either you need a car or you jam yourself onto a city bus called the Deuce, which can take 40-50 minutes to get to the newer casinos at rush hour and can be standing-room-only crowded.If all you want from your stay is to gamble and smoke cigarettes all day, this hotel will probably be fine for you. If not, you are better off staying at one of the newer casinos on the newer end of the Strip. They are less smoky and have a lot more to see and do than the Four Queens.	
Feb 14 2008 	Nice Stay on Freemont	This is my third stay on Freemont Street in two months and it was a nice experience. The room was small but very clean with a nice flat screen tv. Yes I sometimes watch sports that I bet on in the room and rest. The Sportsbook is small but very friendly. After it closes you can cash your tickets at the Cashier of the Casino. They do not have a poker room,but just across the street at Golden Nugget there is a nice one. The only complaint was the hot water was not the greatest,but the stay was worth the money. Compared to the Plaza at the same price range,it was much better.	
Feb 13 2008 	Decent location helpful staff	If this hotel were anywhere else, it would be pretty good. Hence my four star rating. The rooms are clean, the staff is helpful, the parking is free, and the location is convenient in its way. The nastiest drawback is that rooms that are next to Fremont Street have all the noise of the Fremont Street Experience. Otherwise a well run hotel.However, it's in a bad location for Vegasunless you want to be downtown. I did, my wife didn't. She thought the hotel was pretty average. Either way, I'm not sure it merits the $95/night average room rate. Bottom line: if you turn in early make sure you are far from Fremont Street or you won't sleep before midnight. Make sure you score a good deal, because it's not that much better than a Day's Inn.	
Feb 12 2008 	Great Stay	We had a great stay at the 4 Queens. I had called ahead and requested non-smoking, adjoining rooms in the South tower. I was a little worried because we arrived on Superbowl Sunday, but when we checked in all of our requests were met. We had rooms 1142 and 1144 which had a perfect view of the Stratosphere. Our rooms were clean and I liked the updates made to the rooms since my last stay there. Everyone was pleasant and helpful. Ate at Magnolia's several times. My only complaint was the long line waiting to pay the bill. I will stay there again.	
Feb 10 2008 	A great stay under the canopy	We just arrived home after a &quot;great&quot; stay at the 4Queens for 4 nights in room 408-North Tower. It seemed the even number rooms faced Fremont St. We requested 2 queen beds that were under the canopy so we could enjoy the light show and people watch from our room, in the short time that we &quot;expected&quot; to be in it and that's exactly what we got. Early check-in was not an issue and the staff was great.The elevator for the North Tower was 20 steps away (I counted for this review) from Fremont St and our room from the elevator was the same distance. Great!!The room was &quot;very&quot; clean and the beds-pillows were &quot;too&quot; comfortable because when we layed down for a quick nap at 8pm (after a long plane ride in), we slept the night away until 5am. Grrrrr! FSE did not keep us awake nor was the noise from it disturbing. Actually, it was great to just lay in bed and watch it before our, so called.... 9 hr nap. With the window closed (it opens about 6 inches for fresh air), the music etc was not an issue.The room contained a 3 cup coffee maker with all the fixings but we did bring our own coffee, filters etc so we could enjoy coffee the way we like it. According to a wall sign...Ice machines are on floors 4-9-10-12-18-19. Soda($2 for 20oz) machines are on 4-5-8-11-15-17The bathroom contained the usual shampoo, lotion and hand soap. Not a large bathroom, but suited us just fine.Housekeeping was great and did not bother us while we had the &quot;do not disturb&quot; sign on the door.The gift shop closes early but Walgreens is a short block away for anything that you need....meds, snacks, drinks etc.The &quot;only&quot; complaint we had was the casino was too hot to enjoy when the casino got busy at night, even though the outside temps were in the mid 40's, so we ended up playing mostly at the Fremont Casino across the street at night. Great buffet at the Fremont and enjoyed two meals there with 2-4-1 vouchers given for our meager slot play. The Fremont will soon open up a Dunkin Donuts for northeners or us ex-northeners to enjoy...yea!!!Our stay, booked thru their web-site was at a cost of $49-$49-$49-$99-Tues thru Sat but cheaper rates were advertised a week before check-in so watch your rates before you go. I hope I covered all questions and think you'll also enjoy it if you don't expect the costly suites found on the strip. We'll definitely stay at this hotel again.	
Feb 9 2008 	Four Queens was great	Well we stayed at the Four Queens and despite some of the reviews read before going, the hotel was very nice and clean. We had a good time gambling there and Magnolias does have super cheap and very good food. We for the most part had good service at Magnolias as well. The Micro brewery was a great place to hang out and have a few microbrews with friends. The staff were all really nice as we never had a problem with any of them what so ever. I would stay here again.	
Feb 7 2008 	Super Hotel during Super Bowl Weekend!!!	Six of us just returned from our fifth Super Bowl Weekend in Las Vegas. This was our first time staying at the Four Queens and we had an absolutely fantastic time. We stayed five nights (arrived Thursday, departed Tuesday) on the 15th floor of the South Tower where our recently remodeled rooms had new carpet, new furniture, new drapes, new bedding, and a new flat screen TV. Although our bathrooms had not been remodeled and were older, they were still maintained and cleaned. The entire staff, including but not limited to, Check-in, Dealers, Pit Bosses, Cashiers, Waitresses, Bartenders, Security, were friendly, courteous, helpful, and accommodating. We did the majority of our gambling at the Four Queens where the drink service while doing so was expeditious. The food/beverage at Hugos Cellar, Magnolias Veranda, Chicago Brewing Company, and Queens Coffee/Deli was excellent. We have stayed at other Freemont Street hotels and the Four Queens most definitely gives you the best value for your hard earned dollars. Personally, my trip was topped off on the morning of our departure when I decided to give it one more gamble. I played one of the Elvis Slot machines and was rewarded with $413.50 of which I promptly took a portion and made some future bets at the Sports Book. Viva Las Vegas and Viva the Four Queens!!!!!	
Feb 1 2008	Disappointed with Stay	Dear Customer Service,This past weekend my family and I stayed at your hotel. My daughter-in-law, Jennifer Putman had made the reservations under her credit card. She was not with my husband and I at the time of check in for her flight came in later. I was asked to give my credit card to the check in person upon checking in. My husband was unaware that I had given my card to the lady. I was called away on the phone and he finished with the check in. Later that evening in the room I was going through my purse and noticed my credit card was missing. I immediately went to the front desk and they said they did not have it to check with the lost and found in your hotel. They too, did not have it. I immediately called the credit card company to cancel the card. The next evening I again checked at both places to see if the card had been seen. Again, the answer was no. Upon checking out, the a different lady, handed me my card with out me asking for it. I said, &quot;Where did this come from?&quot; Her reply was in the key envelope in your reservation packet. I also was charged incorrectly for the rooms, one at $99 and the other at $159. The lady said the amount was signed for upon check in. Again, my daughter-in-law made the reservation and my husband was not aware of the charges. I find this totaly unethical for two rooms that are exactly alike and for the head ache of my missing credit card that your hotel held in it's possesion the entire time.Sincerely,Barbara J. Putman[--]	
Jan 26 2008 	A Great Experience	Everyone person we met was friendly and helpful. The room arranged for my dad (handicapped) was perfect and set up for his needs. The casino was fun - both slots and cards. The food was good. Overall a great experience and we would go back to the Four Queens in a heartbeat!	
Jan 25 2008 	4 Queens ='s A Great Experience!	Stayed in Vegas from Jan 20 - Jan 24 2008. Stayed at the Four Queens (after staying at the WAY overpriced MGM last time) and found it to be a very nice, wonderful trip. We saved SO much money this time by enjoying all that downtown Fremont Street has to offer. The 4 Queens restaraunts offer discounts with your FREE players card to the tune of $12 breakfasts (for 2 people) and lunches/dinners not much more than that. It was great food also and we ate there a lot! Our room was on the 11th floor and had the most amazing view of the Fremont Experience and Vegas. We took almost a roll of pictures just from the window! We were worried at first (from reading other reviews) that the noise from the street would keep us awake all night, but it was not bad at all. Also, the drapes they have in the room can be shut to black out any light - our room was so dark at night I would almost trip going to the bathroom. Very clean, very friendly, very fun. Everything was lovely, and we will definitly stay here again...and again....and again!	
Jan 24 2008 	Stay Downtown for the best gambling experience.	This property has recently remodeled/updated rooms that are clean and more than acceptable for the room rate. Downtown caters to gamblers who are not interested in the &quot;shopping/show&quot; experience. All the &quot;premier&quot; strip properties look the same and do not offer reasonable table minimums. Often times cocktail waitresses cannot be found on the strip and it was no problem here. If your going to Vegas to gamble, downtown is the spot and this property is worth the money. Would definitely return. If you're looking for glamour and glitz with fancy bathrobes choose the strip.	
Jan 24 2008 	stay was just OK	We stayed at 4 Queens Jan18-20th 2008. Check in and out were very fast, they stored our luggage as our room wasn't ready until 3.We were approached by &quot;timeshare people&quot; leaving the 4queens and entering Golden Nugget every time.We even went on Saturday. 4hours and we didn't buy a timeshare cost was 32,000 and when we kept saying no cost went way down to 5000.When I opened a towel off the clean towel shelf a sticker from size 14-16 fell out of my towel onto the floor. I'm a hefty size 20 so I'm really sure it wasn't mine. It was the kind that sticks to your jeans and runs down the front with the size printed on it. At that moment I was very surprised that my towel had not been washed! In fact the towels never had that fresh scent.My husband spent all af Sunday at the ESPN zone on the strip watching the championship games and he ttok the Deuce which was very handy 5dollars for 24hrs or 2dollars a one way trip, catch it at Walgreens 1 block away and it stops everywhere on the strip.	
Jan 23 2008 	Have stayed here for years! Much the best!	We've gone to Vegas every year during the Super Bowl weekend for 10+ years running. Initially we stayed on the Strip, but for the last 5 years, always the Four Queens.Their service has been great from the time you get out of your vehicle. Whether you drive or use public transportation, you will find getting to the front desk easy.The hotel staff has been great. The only time we had an issue, the Manager made it right by us immediately.The rooms are average size, but always clean. Never any surprises.The casino is small, but the dealers and pit crews are extremely friendly.Restaurants:I'd rate Magnolias about a 3 out of 5. Their food is good and priced right, but their servers seem over-loaded.Hugo's Cellar is a 5/5 as it is one of the best steakhouses in Vegas. Their service is superb and the salad service is done table-side with excellent choices.No buffet in 4Q, but a very good one is right across the street at Fremont.We found a gem in downtown and it never disappoint us!Enjoy!!!	
Jan 20 2008 	Good experience at the Four Queens	This was our first stay downtown. We found the stay very nice. The room was on the small side but, very clean and looked newly redone. The LCD TV was very nice and although there is a charge for wireless it was very fast. Be sure to get your players cards as 2 prime rib dinners only cost us $20, tip and everything. We enjoyed this trip downtown, it was very safe, clean and reasonable. We will be back again. Only complaint i guess was when the tour busses arrived the lines at the elevators was 40 people deep, but it disipated quickly when we came back 20min later.	
Jan 20 2008 	Headed Back To The 4 Queens	My husband &amp; I have been to Vegas three times.The first time we did not stay at the Four Queens.But we have stayed their twice &amp; will be returning Mar.2008.&amp; will be enjoying our stay at the Four Queens.This is by far the best &amp; most friendly hotel,the staff will go out of their way to meet your needs.The rooms are very clean just a great hotel. My husband &amp; I are not &quot;high rollers&quot; but we were treated like &quot;high rollers&quot; just the same.The restaurant is very good too. My husband &amp; I can't say enough good things about the Four Queens &amp; the staff. Kudos to you. Also a morning walk down Fremont street is very enjoyable because of the music.	
Jan 17 2008	Dissapointed by the smell of the room!	Stayed here one night on Jan. 9 because we want to see how it feels to stay DT. Room is smaller than Strip hotels, similar to the size of a Motel 6 room. likewise the bathroom is just ordinary. But they have upgraded the furnishings including bed, LCD TV, carpet, wallpaper. However, we didn't enjoy the room and hotel as much because the non-smoking room we have had a lingering smell of smoke. this prevented us from appreciating the room. If you are used to the posh Strip hotel roooms, then don't go here, you will be disappointed, esp. by the bathroom. If you are not too fancy, then go here. I wouldn't recommend this hotel to a first-timer in Vegas, the experience on the Strip will be much more memorable!	
Jan 17 2008 	Great Stay	This was my first stay at the Four Queens. I love downtown and usually stay at the Fitz. but we wanted to try a different hotel this time. Our stay was excellent. We were treated the same as if we were at a 4 star hotel. The rooms are a little small, but not too small. Plenty of room for everything. Bathroom was very clean. The TV's are new flatscreens. We really enjoyed our stay and will stay again.	
Jan 6 2008 	Loved Staying there	Hi,My boyfriend and I decided to stop in Las Vegas on our way to Arizona for Thanksgiving. We mostly booked the Four Queens because it was inexpensive. It turned out to be the best time we had ever had in Las Vegs. The Strip is nice, but it is too big. We went up to the stip one day to see a show, but you really don't have to go any further than Fremont Street to have everything right at your fingertips. There are several great casinos to go to, but we mostly played in the Four Queens because it was so comfortable. But, if we wanted a break all we had to do is go out the door. They have entertainment evrey night which was absolutely &quot;excellent&quot;. And the service at the Four Queens matched or exceeded any other place we have stayed in Las Vegas. Can't wait to go back.Cathy Mastracchio	
Jan 5 2008 	A pleasant surprise	I just returned from a solo trip this Jan and wanted something econimical and clean. I booked the four queens for 33.95/night week day rate after reading some of the other reviews here and was pleasantly surprised. Checked in early at 1130 am, no problem, king room # 1816 overlooking the top of the fremont canopy. Very clean, new furnishings, carpet, lcd flat panel widescreen tv. The room comes equipped with a coffee maker, iron and board, hair dryer but no mini bar. I had no issues with noise either from the hall or from next door. The staff throughout the casino/hotel were attentive and friendly. I did not try Hugo's Cellar but Magnolia's for breakfast at 6.95 was good.  This is a wise choice if you're looking for clean and comfortable accomodations downtown.	
Jan 3 2008 	Not bad for 2 stars	I stayed here for just one night unexpectedly. We had reservations at the Venetian hotel on the strip but I arrived in Vegas one day early, so I got a priceline deal at the Four Queens. Overall I have to say it wasn't too bad. The rooms were much better than I had expected for a 2 star place - they were very clean, comfy beds, good service etc. The hotel was a bit old and rundown. There were many signs of neglect as well - the ice machine in my hallway was overrun with water and sludge which had seeped into the carpet. Aside from that - the main downside was the location of the hotel. If you're into the older buildings and vintage vegas than this might be your dream place. I have to admit that I did not feel safe walking outside the hotel at night (or much less any time of the day). BTW - there isn't much that makes me nervous or feel unsafe, since I grew up in Baltimore and now live in downtown DC. Keep in mind that the Four Queens is a very different vegas experience than one gets while staying on the main strip. Aside from not feeling as safe - I noticed a large number of vagrants, homless people and drunks in the &quot;freemont street&quot; area. The whole area around the Four Queens also had a strange earieness to it - like an old vintage carnival horror movie with run down buildings, blinking ligts that stopped working decades ago and the heavy stench of dank cigars.Overall - it's certainly a memorable experience staying at the Four Queens. From my experience - you'll be treated well by the staff and you won't be disappointed by your room - but it might be worth spending a few extra bucks to stay at a classier, safer place.	
Dec 31 2007	Almost perfect	Good room, clean, spacious, good beds, good bathroom. Location, perhaps is not the best, but its not far from the main atractions (at the Strip). But if you're not interested in gambling is almost impossible to find a calm place, even for a cup of coffee or for a breakfast. I had to eat my breakfast in a hidden small place where 3 fast-food chains divide the space. Price? Perhaps the best value-for-money I ever had.	
Dec 30 2007	Impressed	We were very impressed, the rooms were very nice and comfortable beds. A little noisy, but enjoyed overlooking Fremont Street. We will stay here again.Thanks	
Dec 29 2007 	The Best Place To Stay For The Money	Stayed Dec. 20 thru Dec. 26th, 2007......My room, in South Tower, 9th floor, was great.....clean and a wonderful bed.....I had a bad experience, passed out from my diebetes low blood sugar and daughter found me on the floor and the maid to the security were fast to get an ambulance there to help me and get me to the hospital Christmas day......they were so caring and helpful.......the restaurant food was very good and the slot machines were loose...........the ice show out on the street was marvelous....I had a great time there and hope to get a good deal so can stay there again in middle of June.Delia JoAn Niedecken	
Dec 20 2007	four queens is a great downtown vegas value	my wife and i and my parents just returned from a two day trip to vegas and stayed at the four queens in downtown - payed $30 a nite mid week and the room and food was fine and location perfect in the middle of freemont street. No problems	
Dec 19 2007 	One night onlybut would love to go back	Unfortunately i only stayed here for one night before flying back home the following day. After driving here from LA me and a friend were pretty tired so we were over the moon that check-in was nice and easy. Because we were going home early the next day we didn't really explore the hotel but what we saw we were impressed. Our rooms were excellent,lovely beds,Flat screen tv,desk and the bathroom was fine. The rates everywhere else in Vegas for one night was a little expensive (must have been a convention in town) but the 4 Queens was very cheap. Can't wait to go back and explore the hotel properly.	
Dec 3 2007 	2 recent trips to 4 Queens	I recently had 2 trips to Vegas to both to the Four Queens. I booked both with Allegiant on 07/07/07. It was such a great deal I was able to go twice, with differnet friends each time. The first time we stayed in room 508 in the north tower. We were told when we checked in that we could move if we had a problem with noise or the lights. We had no trouble at all. We liked the room &amp; the view. We heard no noise &amp; with the drapes &amp; liner closed, you could not see the lights. I really liked the location &amp; especially having the Tickets for Tonight booth right there. I do not gamble, but I like the fun, the lights, the shows, the food &amp; everything else. The second trip, we were in the south tower on the first floor because we needed a smoking room. The room was jsut like the other one, but no view. The Four Queens is a very nice hotel, nice room &amp; good location. I like staying downtown &amp; just visting the strip. Had a nice time &amp; saw lots of shows both times. Thanks Marilyn	
Nov 28 2007 	Excellent	First time in Vegas for me (coming from New Zealand it took us about 20 hours to get there so it isn't something we can do every year!). Husband has been before and he thought Downtown would be great so we spent our first 3 days here from 8 to 11 November.Check-in was fast - no queue at 7pm. Room was fine - not overly huge and a little bit scruffy but nothing the price didn't allow for (our rate was around $60).Casino is really smoky but they have a great choice of machines - not particularly lucky for us. Cocktail waitresses were pretty reliable (not as regular as at La Bayou down the road but they would be without equal!!!).Stupidly dropped my wallet (complete with all my credit cards) on my first night - didn't even know it was missing until Security rang us at 4am to say it had been handed in. A big Thank-you to the porter who handed it in. Were up so early we caught breakfast at 5am and saw Freemont Street without a soul on it - unbelievable! Breakfast at Magnolia was lovely - ate there every morning.Dinner we ate at other casinos - different each night.We moved from Four Queens to Orleans then on to Ballys and Harrahs - Four Queens measured up well against all of them (except the free upgrade to a suite at Bally, needless to say).Our only gripe was the ladies at the Players Card desk should have a bit of an idea about how many points you need to earn before you get any comps - when I asked they told me to go see a host - waited for ages just to be made to feel like a bit of a fool for asking (seems 300-400 points per day are what they are after). I could have been saved the trouble and embarrasment.Still, didn't spoil the stay - would happily go back	
Nov 24 2007 	Loved The Four Queens Nov 11th thru Nov 14th	When I booked my trip for November I decided to try downtown for once. I read all the reviews on the downtown hotels and the most consistent recommendations kept coming from the reviews on the Four Queens Hotel. After staying there, I must agree with the reviews. The Four Queens is a great hotel. I arrived before 12:00 pm and was able to check in as my room was available. The desk clerk was fast and very friendly.  (I usually stay at the Strat and the lines to check in are horrendous). They give you a fun book that has some really good two for one coupons. My room elevators was right off of the lobby area which I found to be very convenient being that you didn't have to walk the entire length of the Casino to get to your room. I give the Four Queens high points for that alone. I was given a room on the 15th floor room 1525. Upon arriving in my room the first thing I noticed was the spaciousness of the room.Two queen beds, flat screen tv and desk.When I entered thebathroom I noticed a handicap chair and bars. They had given me a handicap room. The bathroom was very spacious also.I had asked for a room not facing the Fremont St Exp. but when I looked down I could see the side of the canopy. Although I could hear the music when it started on the hour it was very muted so did not really bother me. My views was mostly of the Golden Nugget and not the mountains in which I am particularly fond of.I found the dining choices at the Four Queens to be a little bit lacking as they have no buffet. Magnolia's is an excellent choice but can get a little crowded around the dinner hour. You have to pick your times to eat there. usually late morning and evening works best. This is a non problem as the Fremont's buffet is directly across the street and on Sundays they have an all day champagne brunch/buffet. There are so many food choices within walking distance of the Four Queens that I never ate at the same place twice. I loved the proximity of the other establishments. I also loved the whole atmosphere of downtown and the entertainment. The Four Queens casino has a good selection of slot machines and they seemed to give you a nice chance of winning. The drink service was quite good also. I overall felt very comfortable gambling in their casino it never felt overcrowded and the people were friendly. I would highly recommend anyone staying downtown and looking for a good budget friendly hotel stay at the Four Queens. I forgot to mention the maid service was also quite good. My room was made up early and plenty of towels were available.	
Nov 19 2007	An excellent choice downtown	Third time in Vegas- first time staying downtown. I really liked the Fremont Street pedestrian mall and Four Queens is right on it. And the bus down to the strip is clean and cheap and easy so we could go there when we wanted and get just a bit away from the masses when we were ready for that. Room price was very good and my room was upgraded and was clean and neat and comfortable. Definitely on the list for when I return.	
Nov 10 2007	Excellent experience	Our room was in the South Tower, and it was very nice. We cannot vouch for the North Tower, but our room was very clean, and had been recently remodeled. It had new carpeting, curtains, (I think beds), and the bathroom fixtures were all working. My priorities start with &quot;Clean and Secure&quot;, and our room rated &quot;excellent!&quot; on both counts. We didn't win much in the casino, actually had better luck at Binion's, but that is not a fair assessment of the hotel because we are not big spenders anyway. Dined at Magnolia's one time, it was good. We noticed there were always long lines for breakfast. It is either real good or real slow. We will be going back to the Four Queens next time because we had a very nice stay for an excellent rate, (I think it was about $60.00 per night.) There are so many places to eat and play on Fremont Street, we only dined at the same place more than once in one restaurant. Try Mickey Finnz. (But that's another review.)	
Nov 10 2007 	Good Budget Choice	I stayed at the 4 Queens for the second time November 4th thru the 8th. The room was basically clean except for some hair on the bathroom floor, which is not acceptable to me even from a budget hotel.I was a little disappointed in the &quot;renovated&quot; rooms, updated since I was there last year. The carpeting, furniture and flat screen TV were nice, but nothing was done to the bathroom. The same cracked and stained tiles were on the bathroom floor and the sink was in bad shape too. Still, my overall experience at the Four Queens was positive. We stayed in room 1446 in the South Tower facing the Strip. The view of the Strip is not all that great because an office building a few blocks away blocks the view. I like the view of Fremont Street and beyond from the odd numbered South Tower room I had last year. The South tower is the one set back away from Fremont Street and is very quiet.The Four Queens more than met my expectations for a budget hotel and I would stay there again.	
Nov 10 2007 	Best place to stay Downtown!	Hubby and I just returned home to Michigan from our best Vegas trip ever! Stayed at the 4 Queens, Downtown. After countless trips making the rounds (Boyd properties, Fitz, Plaza, Vegas Club, Binion's, even splurging for the Golden Nugget) I feel this is the best deal downtown.We checked in on Monday for a four night stay. Check-in staff were friendly and helpful. My husband asked if a suite upgrade would be possible. Yes, we got one for double the room rate we were being charged. It looked exactly like the mini suite in the pic on the website. The armoire has plenty of room on each side of the tv to hide your dirty clothes. :-P It's hard to see in the picture, but there's a fridge with an ice bucket and wine glasses next to the desk and chair. We were on the second floor, but back from the road. I could barely hear the Fremont Street Experience the rare times I was in the room during the evening.We lucked into seeing the Firemen's Combat Challenge World Competition. They were competing right outside the casino.The casino has a half-price ticket outlet. We recommend seeing Larry G. Jones. We saw him back when he did 1001 voices and he was terrific! Thoroughly entertaining. I think he's up to 1003 voices now. We wanted to see him this trip, but he only works weekends now. Good to see him moving up.The 4 Queen's casino personnel are very friendly. My husband played the single deck blackjack until they very politely told him to stop. I played the black jack switch and a new game called California Draw. I don't imagine it will last if everyone is as lucky as I was when Dezdemona taught me the game. She showed me how much trips, two-pair, and even a straight flush paid. I can't wait to go back and try my luck again. The Casino Cage is being remodeled. They were squeezed into a small spot by the restrooms. I never saw less then three cashiers working and never waited in line. Noel was very friendly when he gave me my big winnings from the CA Draw game. We ate at Magnolia's several times. The staff were very smiley and friendly. Wanted to try Hugo's, but too pricey for me. Hubby wanted the $40 rack of lamb. Maybe next time. Even leaving out the fact that I experienced my luckiest night gambling here, I think the Four Queens is the best deal downtown. The suite was clean and roomy. The staff are friendly and helpful. And, the location can't be beat. We were in the tower farther from Fremont St, but were still only steps away from the casino and the action outside on the street.	
Nov 7 2007 	first time at the four queens	Stayed at the four queens nov 1st thru the 4th and this being my first time downtown I was very surprised how nice it was. We usually stay on the strip and now will be going downtown from now on. We had room 1845 18th floor over looking the fremont street experience.Room was very nice had a flat screen tv and a coffee maker which came in handy after a night on fremont.We never had any real issues with the noise as others had said .Maybe we were far enough up but it did not really bother us .It was cool to look down at night and see the show.Fremont street--This was the most fun I have had in vegas so far and I've been on the strip 3 times before this trip.Loved all the things there are to see and do here and you did not have to walk 1 mile to get 1 block like on the strip you know what I meen if you've been on the strip before .everything is within about a five minute walk up or down fremont.There are a few other hotels off of fremont like the main street station and gold spike. which are not that far to walk tofood---We ate at the mainstreet station buffet for lunch. with the 2for1 coupon we had only cost us 4 bucks each and it was very good.Also ate at aloha specialties in the upstairs of the hotel across from mainstreet station and that was fantastic and super cheap.Dont let the location or its appearance fool you its very good.Try the fish,chicken,steak combo yummy.entertainment---We usually watched the free shows out on the fremont street.they had concerts and a U.S championship firemans competition when we were there.Also saw vanessa carlton at the four queens for like 20 bucks what a deal very good show.feel free to email me with questions on fremont street	
Nov 3 2007 	Noise Noise Noise 24/7	Check in was very easy, parking garage with valet parking. and nice clean small rooms but I will not be able to ever stay there again. We were on the 17th floor facing Fremont street and there was music going 24/7 we had attempted to go to bed around 2 am but found out the first night that it was going to be harder than we thought. I would say we maybe got 1 hour sleep the first night and the next night we left the television on to help drown out the music and got about 4 hours sleep. (Mind you I am the one who is able to sleep through tornados). I dont think the music came from the four queens but unfortunately it does affect the patrons. I can only think that this noise is as bothersome to all the other hotel guests all the way down Fremont Street. If you plan on staying and want at least some rest make sure you ask for a room facing away from Fremont.	
Oct 31 2007	Good place to stay!	The hotel was a nice place to stay overall. The cleaning service was a bit slow and the people were not nice but it wasn't bad consideringyou're hardly in your room anyway. I would recommend any first timersto Las Vegas to stay on the old strip because it's not so overwhelming. Plus the light show was an awesome treat. I'd definitely stay there again!	
Oct 29 2007	No car=no problem !	I was fortunate enough to pick a time to stay there when there was lots going on outside the casino..There was a culture festival for about a week and every time I left the casino there was lots going on..It was cool to be close to &quot;home&quot; at the end of a fun filled day outside. The food inside the Four Queens @ Magnolias for late night is good but other establishments are good too! I guess what Im saying is Four Queens is ok because it offers a great price and a great location. There is nothing special about the rooms but they are clean and convienient..I give it an above average rating because of the entertainment outside of the casino.	
Oct 28 2007 	Noisy	Stayed at the Four Queens in the North Tower. The rooms were very clean and have been remodeled with flat screen TV's. We had no problem with the room, just the location. We figured the 19th floor would get us far enough away from the Fremont street experience. We were wrong. The show stops at a decent time, but the music goes on ALL NIGHT LONG. The bass could be heard over our noise maker and the TV we turned on in self defense. I don't know if this is just a Four Queens problem or a downtown problem. Why in the world would you play music at the decimal level able to rattle windows 24 hours a day?Even in the city of fun, you must sleep sometime.	
Oct 16 2007 	magnolia's restaurant/ four queens hotel	We booked our stay at the Four Queens wanting to try the Fremont Experience. Overall the Four Queens was what we expected, the visit was pleasant and we had a great time in the casino, winning enough to keep playing. The rooms were small but we really weren't in the room expect to sleep. The visit would have been great however the 2 visits to Magnolias restuarant left a very bad taste. We first tried Magnolias at night, thinking we would get something and take to our room late one evening. We were seated and waited for about 5 minutes, the a waiter came out to take our order we informed him we wanted it to go, he promptly left our table without saying anything else. We waited for about 5 more minutes just about ready to leave another waiter came to our table to take our order, he took the order and then promptly told us to move from the table and move to a bench and wait. Not what I call customer service. We dined at the Fremont the next morning, and the Golden Nuggett at night. On the third morning we decided to try Magnolia's again for breakfast. The restaurant was not busy, however, we stood in line and waited to be seated. It was apparent the there wasn't a bit of sense of urgency present at all. Finally, we were seated, the service was much to be desired, my girlfriend and I both order the pancake special and requested more syrup however we never received it. Our husbands enjoyed the food, we would have too if able to eat our entire meal. The reason I write this is that I have over 25 years experience in the restuarant industry and I suggest you send someone into Magnolia's as a customer and let them observe the body language of your customers and their reaction to the service they receive. You have a little gold mine here and it full potential is not being achieved. Patty Burnsdandpburns@netzero.com	
Oct 16 2007 	Not bad but avoid the North Tower	The hotel overall is nice. The casino has a wide-range of table and machine games. The restaurants are good and the service is friendly. The biggest gripe that I have is the hotel didn't warn me when I checked in that my room overlooked the Fremont Experience. I stayed out until late so I missed the loud shows from the Experience. But what I didn't anticipate was the music that's played through the speakers doesn't stop. So all through the night I heard the booming bass and the rest of the music. The hotel should advise guests that their room faces the Fremont Experience and that if they wanted to get some peace and quiet then they should ask for a different room. Since I don't think that this will happen, avoid the rooms in the hotel's North Tower, especially the rooms that face the Experience.	
Oct 13 2007 	A Fine Stay	We were heading to Vegas to meet my brother and his adult kids for a reunion. They were staying at the Nugget and had booked way earlier than we did. We tried to stay at the Nugget, but we didn't want to pay &gt;$200 a day. So, we chose the Queens. Check in was fine...no problems, but not that friendly either.Room was fine. You can tell it is old and has been remodeled many times. That's what you get when you choose to stay Downtown! TV was great, bed was confortable, bathroom and shower was fine...isn't that all you need!Did not really gamble there. My favorites are across the street. Spent a lot of time at Fremont and the Shoe (Binions Horseshoe). Try the Binions Steak House...better than Hugos.Ate breakfast at Magnolia's. Service was extremely slow but food is always good. I think there is a shortage of lower end restaurant servers in LV. IMHO.......if you expect luxury and stellar service, stay on the strip. Downtown works for those of us who prefer a less pretenious experience. I would definately stay at the Four Queens again. Why spend money on lodging when you aren't in the room very much????	
Oct 10 2007 	Downtown Disappointment	We had one night to stay in Downtown Vegas, and, based on Tripadvisor reviews, chose the Four Queens rather than our usual Golden Nugget. It was a mistake. They first told us there were no more non-smoking rooms available despite our reservation, but then &quot;found one&quot; after about 5 minutes of discussion. Our assigned room was so small that the furniture left no room to pass wothout turning sideways, and the view of the Fremont St. Experience was &quot;up close and personal,&quot; with the superstructure of the canopy so close outside our window I could have touched it with a broomstick. We returned to the desk and asked to be moved. They obliged, and the new room was larger and located better, but smelled quite smoky. Tthe desk ckerk offered a can of air freshener. One whiff and we declined. Other annoyances included tiny elevators which were constantly overfilled, and a non-meal in the coffee shop, where we sat without menus for more than 10 minutes while people who arrived after us were eating their meals. We left, and tried the ice cream stand, which had a malfunctioning freezer, and thus no ice cream. At least I won enough at the tables to pay for our room and a decent dinner back at the Nugget..	
Oct 5 2007	1st time Downtowner and LOVED it......	1st time to stay downtown and Four Queens made it perfect.The staff is very friendly and the dealers are sweethearts.The room is nothing fancy but clean. The walls are thin but I brought earplugs so no problem. It is great to walk right outside one casino and right into another one. I would stay there again.	
Oct 5 2007 	Good spot	We spent four nights at the Four Queens Hotel in downtown Las Vegas in September. Hadn't stayed there for a long time, and we were really surprised at how nice a hotel it is now, compared to our previous visit. The rooms are not real big but have been redecorated , new furniture and LCD TV, and the beds were just super. Also had a coffee maker! Only problem was the small size of the bathroom, with a very noisy vent fan, but clean and adequate. ( We stayed in the tower with the elevators off the lobby, so all comments refer to that tower.). Enough elevators so you could move up and down pretty quickly. Food was good, particularly the specials at Magnolia's (take your slot card and get a discount.) And of course, the location is just right there in the thick of things. It is a busy place, but all the personnel in the casino and the hotel were very friendly and helpful..... We will return..	
Oct 4 2007 	Good Downtown Hotel	This was my first time staying downtown and chose the 4 Queens for the great reviews it gets on this site. Booked a room for 2 nights. Check-in was quick and friendly and was given a North Tower room. I had heard that the South Tower was nicer but the desk clerk told me that they all had been renovated and the South Tower were all smoking rooms. Thought that to be strange, a whole tower dedicated to smoking rooms. The room was small but nicely furnished with a large flat TV which I never watched. The bed was very comfortable but the walls at least in my room were paper thin. Good thing I brought some ear plugs! Impressed with the in-room coffee maker. You don't see these in the strip hotels that charge 4 times the price. Casino was fun and the dealers were great. I didn't get to eat there because there was always a line at Magnolias but as an alternative I ate at the Bay City Diner and the cafe at the California. Parking gargage is very convenient. Downtown is a great alternative to the strip. Highly recommend the 4 Queens.	
Sep 23 2007 	2 Thumbs Up	All I needed was a low priced hotel, a shower, bed, and tv and thats exactly what I got at the Four Queens. The room was nice and clean. The location couldn't be any better plus going to and from the strip is a breeze by catching The Duece about a block away (make sure you get the $5 pass that last for 24 hrs.) and I was able to check in about an hour earlier than scheduled. If you don't plan on spending too much time in your room and just need the basics the Four Queens should do.	
Sep 21 2007 	Great Location!	We decided to stay another night in vegas, and thought we would give downtown a try. At less than 40 bucks a night, I wasn't expecting much at all. But the hotel was very nice, not classy or anything, but clean, and had a great view of fremont street and the light show. There was also a 32 inch flatscreen tv which was unexpected. The casino was fun, but there were a lot of older people. We are in our early 20s, and were by far the youngest people there. But it was still lots of fun, it didn't feel weird at all. Its not glamorous like the strip, but its nice to just go there, eat and gamble. The limits on table games are much lower than on the strip. If you want to relax, and play in the casino, this is a good place, but there isnt a lot of action aside from that. Good hotel, especially for the price.	
Sep 18 2007 	Would Stay Again	We were in Vegas for a eight day trip staying at three different properties while in town over the Labor Day holiday. This was our first time staying at this hotel, so we were anxious to see what it would be like since we had heard it was recently refurbished. We booked our room over the phone with a casino rate based on our play from our previous visit in May. We did not receive a mail offer and had to call to ask for the casino rate. Check in was very easy with no line at all. The front desk clerk was very cordial and made the experience very pleasant. Our room was in the south tower, room 1033 for four nights. We had a king, n/s room. The accommodations were nice, with new fixtures, beds and a smaller plasma television. They missed a few things when refurbishing this hotel, though. The shower curtain was old and in desperate need of replacement. There was a smashed spider stuck to the outside of it that looked like it had been there for a while. The air conditioner/heater unit and controller were disgusting and the smoke alarm also needs to be replaced (see photos). I don't get how they could spend so much on updating the rooms and forget the details. We didn't notice a work-out room or a swimming pool while we were there, so those are definitely negatives if those amenities are important to you. My sister and her family stayed at the Golden Nugget, so I went down to visit them at the pool while we were there. We stayed at the GN on our last trip to Vegas, and it was very nice. My in-laws had four free nights at the Plaza and were there for a slot tournament, so we had the room to ourselves. The location of the Four Queens is great since you are smack dab, right in the middle of things on Fremont Street. There is a McDonalds right across the street and a Walgreens within walking distance. We ate at Magnolia's, which is in the hotel, with a buy-one, get-one free coupon from the American Casino Guide (buy on the web or at book stores $14.95-well worth it!). The prime rib was excellent and very reasonable. I would highly recommend this restaurant. We did spend some time in the casino and when we went to the slot club to ask if we had any comps or cash coming back, the slot club attendants were VERY rude. They could really benefit from some basic customer service training. We noticed this on our last visit, and again on this visit. My father-in-law also commented on how rude they were to both he and my mother-in-law.Even though they missed a few things when updating the rooms and the slot club attendants were rude, we will definitely stay at this hotel again since the bed was comfortable and the location is good. I would definitely recommend this hotel to a friend as long as they were not looking for a total resort type of hotel since theres no pool, spa or work-out facility on site. Please feel free to ask any questions regarding our stay.	
Sep 17 2007	Four Queens Was Great!	My Husband and I stayed at Four Queens Sept 13-16th. We have never stayed Downtown before and thought we would give it a try. For a great price we figured how bad could it be? FQ exceeded our expectations!!CHECK IN:The front desk check in was wonderful.... no wait...friendly..and they honored all of our requests. I had asked for a King bed, non smoking, facing the Fremont street side of the hotel.ROOMS:We received a room on the fifth floor (518). We loved facing the Fremont Street Experience it was great! The Four Queens is one of the only hotels downtown that actually has rooms under the &quot;canopy&quot; facing Fremont Street. We could watch the light show right from our room! (people watching was great too!) The even numbered rooms face fremont street. There was some noise from the light show and they play music all day long. It stops at Midnight. No big deal! We kind of enjoyed the music.CASINOThe Casino was good. We saw many other people winning! We didn't!!PARKINGParking was easy. We self parked our car, but they had Valet also. On Saturday night they allowed us VIP PARKING even though the sign said the lot was full.NO POOLThe FQ doesn't have a pool, but honestly...we were so busy, we didn't miss not having it.RESTAURANTSWe ate at Magnolias twice, the food was average, cheap enough, the wait staff left a little to be desired, we had a little language barrier problem with the girl that got the drinks in the restaurant, but the server was average...... Overall it was AVERAGE!! DOWNTOWN AREA The Downtown area has honestly been revitalized. They have so much to offer. There was a Ariel performance, a Motorcycle stunt show, a stage with a variety of performers, plenty of Kiosks selling gifts and snacks. In the evening they brought out rolling bars selling adult beverages. It seemed like a big happy, party, with a fun atmosphere. I will say the FQ is not a Luxury Property, But they don't charge a Luxury price!It fit our needs and I would recommend it to people that are looking for a clean, nice, friendly hotel in downtown......We have stayed at Flamingo, Harrahs, Monte Carlo,Luxor, and Palace Station. Just to give an idea of what we are comparing past stays to.The Four Queens is a solid choice.	
Sep 17 2007 	First class budget hotel great location	The Four Queens is a great budget hotel, the staff are friendly and helpful. The hotel is situated in the Downtown area and leads directly onto the Freemont street experience (sound and light show). The hotel is clean and the rooms are well decorated and have recently been refurnished, including flat screen tv's, the beds are very comfortable!We joined the players club (free to join- get a free t shirt) and got great meal deals in the Magnolia resteraunt, situated in the casino, I can recommend the salads- enormous and delicious.We will definately return!! Great Value.	
Sep 15 2007 	Loved the Four Queens	Returned 13 Sept from a three night stay at the 4 Queens. Traveled with my sister and a friend. It was my friend's first time in Vegas and my sister had not been there in about 15 years. We all enjoyed the 4 Queens. The check in staff was great. We arrived early and our room was ready, but it was on the 2nd floor so I asked for something higher up since my friend had never been to Vegas and I wanted her to be able to see the strip from our room. There was no problem, we only had to wait for a couple of hours before it was ready. The food at Magnolias is very good and the prices are great. Only encountered one problem. We had a very rude waiter one night. Not only was he rude to us, but heard him being rude to other people around us as well. The rooms are very nice and the mattress is very comfortable. There were three of us in the room and had to ask for extra towels, again with no problem. Our room was room 1842 in the south tower. It overlooked the mountains and the strip. Would stay at the 4 Queens again.	
Sep 15 2007	Great bargain nice rooms!	Stayed at the 4 Queens Sept. 3-6, 2007. We've stayed all over Vegas but have never stayed downtown, so we thought we'd give it a try. Found a great deal of $44 per night (Mon-Thurs). We stayed in room 1216 in the north tower, which overlooked the light show canopy over Fremont Street. The room was very clean, the bed was very comfortable (I like a firm mattress) and the staff was very friendly and helpful. The discounted breakfast and dinner deal in Magnolia's restaurant with your player card is a great perk. The 1/2 off ticket booth is also located in the casino, which is convenient. Unfortunately, there were no shows offered that we wanted to see. We didn't have any problem with noise coming from Fremont Street. The light show ends at midnight and who gets to bed before that in Vegas? The machines paid pretty well, but we kept playing and ended up giving the money back to the casino. But isn't that part of being in Vegas? We also attended a time share presentation that they offer from the lobby. We stuck to our guns and said no and in return we got a voucher for free future stay in Vegas as well as $80 spending money to be used at 4 Queens. We enjoyed a free dinner and spent the rest on gambling. Not bad!Overall, we were very pleased with our room and stay. We'll definitely stay here again.	
Sep 8 2007 	Great Value Stay in Downtown LV	Just got back yesterday (Fri., Sept. 7) from a stay at the Four Queens. Stayed in room 801 in the north tower, facing south away from the FSE. The room was nicely remodeled, with new furnishings, including a wide screen flat TV. It seemed to be a little larger than the rooms at the Fremont across the street, and a little smaller than the rooms at Fitzgeralds next door. The bathroom was clean and bright, no mold or stains in sight. Again larger than Fremonts, smaller than Fitzgeralds. Typical motel/hotel bathroom. Valet parking was quick an easy. Every employee encounterd was pleasent and helpful. This was my third stay at the 4Q's in the last 3 years, and I would certainly stay there again. The 4Q's (along with the Fremont and Fitzgeralds) is a solid, dependable value stay in downtown LV. A little play on their slot card will bring free and discounted room offers, but even the standard online rates are very reasonable. I was only staying one night, solo this time, so I did not try it this time, but in the past the $20 trick has gotten us a &quot;free&quot; upgrade to a petite suite. Magnolias Cafe and Hugo's are good casual and upscale dining choices. Had a bad experiance at the Chicago Pizza and Pub one time, but it may have just been a bad night.	
Sep 7 2007 	What a pleasant surprise this hotel turned out to be!	Newly renovated/remodeled rooms. Nice casino. This hotel is right at the center of the Fremont Street Experience (canopy light show.) All the amenities that are normal in non-casino hotels were in our room: Really comfortable beds, hairdryer, iron/board, COFFEE maker IN ROOM (unheard of in any other casino hotel I've ever stayed in.) Big flat screen TV. We called for extra pillows and they were delivered within less than five minutes. We stayed on weekday nights and at $30 per night had a better room than we've sometimes had at double or triple that rate. Highly recommend this hotel!	
Sep 2 2007 	Best in 7 trips	My father-in-law and myself are from Canada and we checked in Aug 24th to Aug 31st/07. Our first contact was the Valet Parking which was immediate. Actual check in only took moments and the room in the South Tower was very clean, spacious and well equiped with amenities. All staff we encountered during the week were courteous and helpful. The slot machines were generou as I hit 2 jackpots for which tax was withheld and 3 at $1175.00. After the first meal the staff in the restaurant Magnolia's remember us and with the food being so good and prices reasonable 90% of our meals were eaten there. I could continue on with compliments however I just want everyone to know after staying at 3 other hotels on the strip at much higher rates the Queens will be my Hotel of choice for future stays.Marcel BinetteThunder Bay, Ontario Canada	
Sep 1 2007 	Woderful Time Better than the Strip!!!	Two Friends and I recently stayed at the Four Queens for two nights on our Vacation to Las Vegas. We all work in retail and have very tight budgets to go on, so Price was a big concern for us which is we chose to stay downtown for two nights and on the Strip for two Nights. The Four Queens had some of the nicest rooms i have seen in Las Vegas (remember we aren't wealthy and can't afford over $50/night so the comparison is based on rooms under $50/night in Vegas) The hotel staff was very kind and helpful and acted like they actually cared! :-) All of our &quot;Special Requests&quot; were honored (adjoining Rooms, Non-Smoking, one with two queen beds and one with one king bed) We were on the 11th floor and the elevators worked great, not slow at all. I was afraid to stay downtown based on all the &quot;Negative&quot; reviews posted about how shady it is and how gross and disgusting the hotels and casinos are, But we had a blast, this was the funnest trip I have had yet, the only bad part about this trip was when we checked out and moved to the Imperial Palace on the Strip (Please read my review for that one) I can honestly say that we all had more fun downtown then we did on the strip and we spent a lot less time walking and a lot less money downtown than on the strip. I am planning on taking a birthday get-a-away in december and plan on staying at the FQ again!	
Aug 30 2007 	Well worth it!	Stayed fri. Aug.24-27 at Four Queens. The last time we stayed at the Plaza, nice also. I can't figure why people want to pay so much on the strip? I have stayed at Imperial Palace and sun coast another nice one.  Our room at the Four Queens was great, clean, quiet, dark with drapes closed, great for sleeping. Updated well. Nice beds and flat screen. Stayed on 15th floor, adjoining rooms. Roundtrip shuttle to the airport only $16. Food downtown half the price. Market Street Buffet (seafood) $15. It was 107 degrees but under the canopy at freemont street made it okay, it is aug. at the desert. I have no complaints. Also the check-in was great plus they let us have late check-out.	
Aug 28 2007	always the best in town!	I always stay at the Queens, they have the best sevice and the most helpful staff in all of Vegas, my casino host (Brain) makes sure my stay there is always great! he is awesome!!!!!! thank you again!  Tammy M.	
Aug 22 2007 	Love the Four Queens	Aug 21 2007 - My husband and I went for a spontaneous weekend and had a fantastic time once again at the Four Queens. We have stayed here 3-5 times over the past year and have enjoyed every visit - The staff always make you feel welcome, check in is a breeze, Casino Hosts are awesome, Magnolias is great - food is good old fashioned cooking and the staff are very friendly. Can't beat the prices either. Rooms have been renovated and they are bright and clean - felt very comfortable in the room . For the most part we do o,k. on the slots here and this visit was no different other than I had a little too much liquid courage and so consequently felt a little braver than usual which I highly don't recommentd. Overall though a pretty great long weekend and we are already planniing on our next visit to Vegas and will most likely stay at the Four Queens again unless we decide to go to the Strip. Usually stay at the Golden Nugget but since reno's and new owners definetly not impressed anymore.Fremont Street is great if you don't want to do alot of walking.	
Aug 18 2007 	Great Room Great Service and A Great Coffee Shop! (Magnolia's)	I stayed for one night a week ago today (8/11) and have stayed here over the years and find this Casino Hotel to have GREAT value! The front desk was very friendly, the room was clean (Rm 1211 North Tower), and had a view of the Golden Nugget and downtown...The mattress was extremely comfortable and clean, fresh sheets. The only problem was understanding how the bathtub drained, but that was rectified by the maintenance man who was there in less than 20 minutes.The Magnolia had outstanding service and served huge portions of freshly cooked entrees at very reasonable, working-man's prices. Everything was good!I missed going to the beer bar where they offer shrimp, oh well there's always next time! I encourage anyone to stay here because the 4 Queens offers great value, and you can walk or take a cab to other casinos.	
Aug 14 2007 	Enjoyed our stay at the Four Queens	We stayed at the Four Queens Aug. 7-11. We arrived early Tuesday morning but were able to get an early check-in. The personnel were very courteous and helpful and housekeeping did a wonderful job. Our room was small but comfortable and impeccably clean. We were given room 519 in the North Tower. Even though it did not have a good view, the elevator would take us straight to the casino and was close to the exit to the Fremont Street Experience. Fremont street beats the hustle and bustle of the strip and one doesn't have to do much walking to get from one casino to another. We enjoyed our stay at the Four Queens.	
Aug 14 2007 	Great Hotel for less than 100 Bucks in Downtown Vegas	We have stayed at this hotel for one night.We enjoyed our stay.We booked one queen bed room.It was in eighth floor.Room was clean.Bed spreads and curtains were new.It's recently rennovated one.So room was also bright with new painting.There is one flat screen 27&quot; tv. AC worked well.If you are looking for some decent area and reasonable price it's the best choice.because in Vegas it's not safe to stay in all locations.I hope you know the reason for that.This hotel is located in fremont street.Opposite to the Golden nugget Hotel.We stayed at golden Nugget last year for 55$ per night.Because they were rennovating.(:-.This time it is 125$.Hmmm.	
Aug 12 2007	All bets on 4 Queens	We just got back from a 4 day stay at the 4 Queens Hotel and Casino. The rooms had been recently renovated complete with 32&quot; LCD TV. We stayed in a smoking room, which did not have the lingering scents of cigarettes most smoking rooms tend to have. The room was clean and the staff were very helpful. Check in went smooth and quick as we arrived on a Monday evening around 9pm. Although there are several restaurants on the property, we only dined at Magnolia's. It over looks the casino floor and has geat deals on Prime Rib $8.99 or a doulbe cheese burger for $5.95 for those who join the Players Club. The food was great with good sized portions. Food is much less expensive downtown than on the strip. We enjoyed the $9.99 lunch Buffet at the Golden Nugget , the $2.99 Big Shrimp Cocktail at the Golden Gate, and the Paradise Seafood Lunch Buffet for $17.99 at The Fremont Hotel. The Nugget's buffet was very good. However, if you like King Crab Legs go to the Paradise Buffet, they serve them cracked and chilled every Tuesday , Thursday and Friday. We also have to make mention of a secluded little downtown jewel; Mamacita's Mexican Restaurant is tucked in a row of sun bleached buildings on (611)East Fremont just 2 blocks east of the Fremont experiance. On our last night in town we decided to venture on the east end of Fremont st. We was a sign that said Mex Food and being a true gambler took a chance and came out a winner on this great little mexican place. The burrito was delicious and a big as the platter. A cuban sandwich made with real pork roast. On the strip we ate at the The Village Buffet at Paris. It was &amp;15.99 for lunch and worth every penny if you like a great variety of french cuisine ...Desserts and cheeses to die for!!!!Gambler's Note: 4 Queen's Roulette tables have $2 min ..the lowest in downtown or on the strip!!!!VIVA LAS VEGAS	
Aug 7 2007 	Great Place to Stay in the Downtown Area	We were recently in Vegas for a private weekend concert/party at Hooters, but after that event we stayed another 3 days. We prefer to stay in the downtown area rather than the being a part of the hustle and bustle of the strip. We found a great internet room rate at 4-Queens. After many years of coming to Vegas, I always thought of 4-Queens as an old run-down hotel, but was quite pleasantly surprised. The lobby and rooms had been completely refurbished with new furniture, flat screen TV, and very clean. The staff was friendly, the Bellman was very accommodating, the front desk personnel (while not smiling), did let us check in early. The casino has modern machines and adequate tables for gaming. There were lots of machines to cash tickets so no waiting in line. The food at Magnolia's was very good for the price and very generous portions. If you present your Players Card, you get an additional discount. Would definitely stay at 4-Queens again!	
Aug 5 2007	Our room was burglarized and I'm sure it was an inside job.	I stayed with some friends at the 4 Queens. While there, our room was burglarized, and items stolen included a brand new laptop, new model BlackBerry, expensive sunglasses, and other items. It's a long story, but the pattern of what was taken and what was not taken led us to believe very strongly that it was an inside job, and that our room was actually cased the day before the burglary to prepare for the theft.Afterward, the hotel could not possibly have been less responsive or considerate - they did not even offer us a discount on the room (actually, I can't even recall an apology), and as far as we can tell, performed no investigation whatsoever regarding the theft - their only communication was to say they were not responsible, and I never even got so much as a follow up call from the manager or anyone else. Even if you didn't think it was an inside job, what does it say about the place that the hotel does not even care enough to follow up, let alone offer a discount or anything else you might expect, when people have thousands of dollars of goods stolen out of a locked room?If you value your possessions in the least, or decent customer service, I would strenuously advise against ever staying at the 4 Queens for any reason.	
Jul 23 2007 	You Must Try The Four Queens!	We stayed at the Four Queens July 17 &amp; 18th in the South Tower. My parents stayed in an adjoining room. Our rooms were 545 &amp; 547, both non-smoking with two beds per room. My 80-yr-old mother has stayed in the FQ about five times over the years, and the last time was 10 years ago. She has always said how she loves the Four Queens! After reading the reviews here, I was apprehensive about the quality of the rooms, and the hotel as a whole. I didnt know what to expect, since everyones idea of quality is so varied. I myself tend to be somewhat picky. Since my parents wanted to stay at the FQ because thats where weve always stayed, I agreed to stay there. I can say with all honesty - I am so glad that I did! Our rooms were more than reasonably priced. The rooms were very clean and sparkling. I saw nothing dirty about anything that I used or looked at. Yes, it is an older-type hotel and rooms, but it is elegant too. The place has personality. I wasnt exceptionally impressed with the registration desk clerks. They were not rude, but they were non-smiling, unfriendly and aloof. And it wasnt that busy at the FQ during the week. Also during check-out, our desk clerk did not even mention that if we had a Players Club card (we did), that we should check with the Players Club Host to see if we may be able to comp our rooms (we were able to comp both nights and had a free stay at FQ). Had I not read it at this website, I would not have known to do it. The room had a new flat-screen T.V., which I only watched a little. The air conditioner kicked tailfeathers and kept the room cool since it was 114 degrees outside. Our rooms looked out over the hotel canopy and partially over the Fremont Experience. Music started around 8 p.m. and stopped at 12 a.m. Who the heck is in their room sleeping at Midnight while visiting Las Vegas anyway? Take handy-dandy foam earplugs with you if you have a doubt. The casino was active and nice and had plenty of modern, fun slot machines, and was comparable to other casinos as far as variety and pay-offs. We ate at Magnolias Restaurant, and to me  the food was just so-so. I wish wed ventured out to places to eat outside of FQ, but didnt to save time. We did not try Hugos Cellar. Acting on the advice of other reviewers, I tried the Deuce (double-decker bus) to travel from the FQ in Old Vegas to The Strip. There is a lot more to traveling that way than meets the eye. Reviewers had described it as a convenient way to get around. I did not find that to be true. As a not-so-physically-fit 50-Something, to have to walk the distance from the FQ to the Deuce depot to catch the bus in the blazing heat of the late morning was almost unbearable. It was much further than described by an FQ employee. Once I arrived, I had to stand in a long line of others waiting to board in the heat. I was so glad that my mother had decided not to join me, as she would not have been able to withstand it. I did buy the $5 all day pass as I wanted to visit various places along the Strip. It is $2 each time you board if you dont have the pass. The Deuce was cramped, crowded and slow. From the beginning boarding, to the final boarding, and the times in-between, it was the same. The seats were all full and people were standing in the aisles jammed together like sardines as the Deuce inched its way along the strip. Folks, this was during a weekday! One time I was standing at one of the stops to board, and there were so many people waiting to board, the bus stopped and took on about 4 people and pulled off. The remainder of us had to wait in the heat until the next bus came along and there was pushing and shoving to get on the next one. My return trip back to the Four Queens from MGM Grand took at least an hour. The only other option is to take a taxi. I believe if I go to Vegas again, I may opt for the taxi. The Four Queens may not be a 5-Star hotel like some of the newer ones, but it is certainly worth more than the charge to stay there. If I get the chance to go to Vegas again, I would definitely stay at the FQ. So should you. You wont be disappointed.	
Jul 21 2007 	Good Price Excellent Room	My husband and I just stayed there July 9-13 2007. Check in was wonderful, no lines, friendly staff. We had a non smoking room # 518. It had the best view of Freemont Street. We were on the corner of all four major downtown casino's. Binion's , Freemont, Golden Nugget and of course 4 Queens. We were also under the canopy so we got to see the light show sitting at the table in out hotel room. It last only minutes and is not as loud as we were expecting. Open the window and you could hear the bands playing and see the action and sound on the street. They held our bags after checkout at noon, we didn't leave till 8 pm, no charge, no hassle. Maid service was excellent. Anything you need, from extra packets of suger and coffee they would provide with pleasure. We got up late and always missed room clean-up but they always came back and even the one day we did miss it the left eveything we needed outside our door. No problems with strangers wandering the halls. Night quiet place and we won at hotel casino as well. Low key atmosphere. Nice to return to at night after the hustle and bustle on the strip. Would return to stay again with plesure. Great bargain as well.	
Jul 21 2007 	wonderful experience	We stayed at Four Queens from July 9th thru the 12th. This was one of the hotels I had never stayed at. We loved it! The first room we had overlooked the Freemont Street experience but only had one bed. We needed 2. Fron t desk switched us with no problem to a different room. They are all recently remodled very clean and quiet. We had room service the next day and service was very quick. They have a ton of different games and the food at Magnolias was excellent for under 7.00 with your club card. My parents drove up from Ca. I can never get them away from the strip and the Flamingo. They enjoyed downtown and the Four queens much better and they will stay there next time. We moved to the vegas club for the next 3 nights because of free room offer. Not that I dont like Vegas Club but it was a big mistake. Should have stayed at Four Queens since it was only 32.00 a night. What a deal.	
Jul 21 2007	Great Show Great Price!(Reprise)	I stayed at the 4Q with my wife and daughter from 2 July to 9 July, 2007. This review is a continuation of my 4Q review of the same title from July, 2006.Just as last year, I totally enjoyed the Four Queens. The entire hotel is clean and well-staffed; the location is perfect.Here are my detailed tips and updates:1. Check-in was SO quick! No lines, early check-in OK. I requested a North Tower room and tipped at registration to get the kind of room I wanted.2. You can watch the Fremont Street Experience shows from your window, if you request an even-numbered room on the 4th, 5th, or 6th floor. The FSE shows ran at 8:30, 9, 10, 11, and midnight each night.3. There was no evidence of slow elevators. Last year, I frequently saw impatient South Tower visitors; I never saw any frustration about elevators at the 4Queens this year.4. All rooms have new flat-screen TVs. Cool! You can watch the keno draw on one channel, and another channel has gambling instructional videos.5. I never saw any $2 minimum blackjack tables, as I did last year. Tables were always $5 minimum.6. There were LOTS of full-pay Jacks or Better video poker machines. You really have to look, because most of the machines are newer and play multiple games. The &quot;Deuces Wild&quot; machines offer Full-Pay Jacks-or-Better; these are 4-5 rows west of the craps tables. This is not a small issue; it is 100% average payback, even if you are playing nickels!!7. There is another bank of eight full-pay machines right behind the keno parlor/sports book. These seem to be well-known, as they are often full. However, the keno board above these machines is the one broadcast on the hotel's keno channel; you can stand up and WAVE to everybody on TV! 8. Sports book closes at night? Wow. That is not good. When they ARE open, though, the attendants are very helpful and fun!9. Magnolia's Restaurant is VERY nice. Your 4Q slot club card saves you up to 45%, especially at breakfast. I did not visit Hugo's Cellar.10. There is no pool, but you can usually walk into the Golden Nugget pool area and shark tank.11. Parking was free with the VIP card you get at check-in. The parking garage is small, though: on weekends, the self-parking may fill. I use Valet parking on Fri/Sat nights; a $2-$3 tip gets your car fast enough.12. Don't miss the shows &amp; events downtown. The spray-paint artists are still there, but the lady who writes on rice grains was gone. There is usually live music between 4Q and the Fitz; there is usually a pianist between Golden Gate and Vegas Club each night.13. Do NOT let the timeshare sellers soak up your precious LV time. Tell them you are headed out to catch your flight. They'll back off.14. I love the small Four Queens pens that are on the writing tables. Yes...I took one...I now have three of these flat pens.15. If you must go to the strip, take the parallel Industrial Road to save time.My family was impressed with 4Q again. We will stay there again next time. It only takes one glance at 50-100 desperate travelers in a check-in line at Circus Circus or Luxor, to remind you about he value of stayong downtown. Let the others pay $250 per night on the Strip.Put &quot;Las Vegas&quot; in the subject line of an e-mail, if you need details.Gene Padgett! (DrGPadgett@nctv.com)	
Jul 17 2007 	Way Way better than I expected...	My boyfriend and I stayed at the Four Queens July 13th -15th. It was our first time in Vegas and we enjoyed every moment. Checkin was so easy...no lines or waiting. The desk clerk was very accomodating when I requested to be as high up as possible. Neither one of us smoke so we had some hesitation when she said she had a smoking room on the top floor but we took the chance and accepted the room she offered ( room 1960 ). Amazingly the room didnt have a strong smoke odor at all, actually we didnt smell anything! And the view was such a pleasant surprise, a beautiful view of The Strip and mountains!!!! We had plenty of towels, the room was clean and cold considering it was 108 degrees outside.We ordered room service the next morning, they were so nice and pleasant as well as quick. We had a hot delicious breakfast at our room in about 15 minutes after we hung up the phone. The staff in the gift shop were also soooooo nice. The location was great not nearly as crowded as The Strip. The bus service called 'The Duce' was right on the corner and the day pass is the way to go if you want to visit The Strip. I would recommened Four Queens to everyone I know and ill make it my only choice for my future visits to Vegas BABY!!!	
Jul 15 2007 	worth the visit to downtown freemont street	This was the first hotel that we stayed in on trip to las vegas,to start with i was very impressed with the room it was comfortable and clean it included a 32&quot; lcd tv (that we didnt use)all in all a great hotel for the price ($38) the only thing was the view that we had , it looked over the top of the freemont street canopy and it did look a mess it did'nt matter because we only used the room to sleep.tanyway the staff were friendlier than the strip ones and very helpful. I do recommend trying freemont street if you are visiting las vegas if only to spend a day there	
Jul 12 2007 	Very Pleasantly Surprised	As first I was hesitate to stay here. I wanted to visit the area but wasn't sure I wanted to stay in the area. I was happy that I did, in more ways than one. The lights of the place are obviously exciting. The registration desk is very nice. The people were very friendly and eager to help. The room was nice, upgraded tv although we didn't watch it much. The bathroom is small. You have to close the bathroom door before you sit on the toilet! It was clean and well maintained. The casino is small, but I won a good chunk of money there! The buffet across the street at the Fremont is to die for. Walk out the front and the Fremont Street Experience awaits you at dusk until midnight. Lots of street fun going on too. Would love to stay here again.	
Jul 11 2007 	Clean 	Our rooms were $32/ night through AAA. At that price I was a little afraid, but the rooms were nice. All 3 rooms had good beds, 42 TVs and were very clean. They are a little on the small side, but that was fine with me. We had rooms 1606, 1608 &amp; 815. Even numberd rooms face Fremont St and odd numbered face the strip.	
Jul 9 2007	Four Stars for the Four Queens	Booked the Four Queens through Allegiant, on a last minute impulse trip. I was traveling with my father, thought the downtown area was a easier walk for him, since it was very hot.I was pleasantly pleased with the property. The check in was effortless, no wait, great customer service. We were given a room on the 1st floor. Room 145. It was a smoking room, but you could not tell at all. The room was clean and the beds were comfortable. The maid left us extra pillows and coffee at our request. No room safe, but we managed without one.The bathroom was clean and worked for the two of us. Join the players club and take advantage of discounted food in Magnolias. We had Pizza at the Chicago Brew Pub, it was excellent. I would stay at the Four Queens again, in a heart beat.We usually stay at the Golden Nugget, but the Queens had more comfortable beds.	
Jul 3 2007	Fine room; bargain price; nice staff!	When choosing a hotel in Las Vegas, it's important to consider what is important to you. If, for instance, you are not satisfied unless your bathroom is huge, made of marble, and equipped with a phone by the toilet, then don't stay at Four Queens. Similarly, don't stay there if you need 25000 thread count sheets and beds that are fit for Diamond Jim Brady. If that stuff is more your style, run, don't walk, to places like Bellagio, THE Hotel, and The Venetian. And bring a great deal of cash and your best posing clothes while you're at it.If, however, you are looking for a clean, abeit small room to lay your head for a couple of nights, and don't mind staying Downtown as opposed to The Strip, I found Four Queens to be excellent, and a superb value as well.My friend and I had a very good experience, starting with the price, which totaled $200 for three nights, including Friday and Saturday night, when Vegas hotels siphon money at the same rate as Keno. For that $200, we had NO WAIT at check in, and the woman who checked us in was kind, courteous, and even let us check in a couple of hours early. When I visited Paris to gamble the next day, I saw throngs of frustrated tourists waiting to check in...and probably paying triple the price.Yes, the room is fairly small, and yes, the decor is dated. But the room was immaculate, there was a plasma TV, and the bed was fine. Think about it: when you are sleeping, do you really notice how expensive the mattress is?The room was quiet, though to be fair, that may have had as much to do with who our neighbors were as anything else. We had a splendid view of a parking garage, but when in Vegas, the only time I stare out the window is to bemoan my blackjack losses. So for that, a parking garage seems appropriate. None of the noise from the hectic Fremont Street leaked into our room, but then again, that may have had as much to do with our room placement as anything else.The casino was friendly and accommodating, with plenty of cheap tables, even on the weekend. Plus, about 10 other casinos (literally) are within walking distance, and Golden Nugget is right across the street. If you really like to gamble and jump from casino to casino, Downtown has The Strip beat hands down. The crowd certainly is older and more &quot;middle class&quot; than down the road, but again, it's what you value in your Vegas trip. In addition, joining the players' club was a snap, and was given a free deck of cards for doing so, which not one other casino club did. Parking cost $3 a day, which I was more than willing to pay considering what our room cost.To sum: If you want a clean, comfortable room with a very accommodating staff at a bargain rate, Four Queens just might be King of Downtown.	
Jun 27 2007 	Good Stay	We stayed at the Four Queens June 17th thru June 21st 2007. The rooms were very clean and comfortable. This was our first stay downtown, we saw everything, ate at many places and gambled alot. It was fun, but I think it is back to the strip next year!	
Jun 23 2007 	Four Queens is Tops!	My husband and I have been coming to Vegas 3 times a year for ten years. We've always stayed in the Golden Nugget. This year we chose &quot;Four Queens&quot;, and we are certainly glad we did! The people are much nicer. The beds were a thousand times more comfortable! We always have small room charges, usually no more than a 100 dollars. The Nuggett has NEVER chosen to comp our room chargers. However, our first stay and the Four Queens, said we'll comp your room charges. We will never stay at the Nugget again!	
Jun 19 2007	Love Downtown	In May my friend and I stayed at the 4 Queens. The rooms have been renovated and are really nice. We ate at the restrauant (mollies) and the food was average. We ate at Main Street station (buffet) and were very satisified with everything. We also had breakfast at the Paris Buffet. Food was good but kind of pricy for us. We like downtown where everything is in walking distance. The best breakfast we had was at eh Golden Nugget. We had a two for one coupon, but would go back without it anytime. I see people writing reviews that really bad mouth the Downtown area. Maybe if you have Thousands of dollars to spend you look at things from a different angle. The second floor reastraunt at the Vegas Club is good and you et more than you can eat. The only negative thing we encountered was asking for a late checkout at the Queens. Seems we didn't play a couple of hundred bucks a day to earn that. We played all over downtown and it seems to get comps you really need to play at ONE CASINO---not spread it around. We still had a really great time and can't wait to go back.	
Jun 17 2007 	Vincent the front desk clerk was great.	Vincent is a great desk clerk, who checked us in and is helpful. Enjoyed the food at Magnolia's Veranda. Thank you.	
Jun 9 2007 	Old School Vegas	We stayed at the Four Queens on 5/30-6/01. First off, in Vegas you pretty much get what you pay for. I paid about $500 (for my wife and I) for a flight/room package out of Lansing, MI. We had stayed at this holtel before, and were happy with what we got. Our room was on the 4th floor in the South Tower. We never heard any noises outside, and felt safe the whole time, even though the chain on our door was missing!!. All the rooms have been &quot;remodled&quot;, and include newer tables and chairs, and flat screen plasma tvs. The bed was fine, and the room seemed to be pretty decent. The shower and sink both drained ok, although both were in need of some cleaning!! We ate at Magnolias, located in the casino, the first night and had a nice prime rib dinner with all the trimmings. I think our total bill was under $20 for the 2 of us!! Can't beat that!! The casino is good size and 2 people in our party won a good amount of money. One place I recommend visiting downtown is the Main Street Station buffet. They have a filet mignon and shrimp scampi that was to die for!! If you look hard enough you can find 2 for 1 coupons right on Fremont St!!! I would recommend this place for people who like the old part of Vegas and also for people who are on a budget and don't mind rooms that are basically just for sleeping and showering!! One tip about parking at Four Queens, use the Valet, it is so much easier and worth the $2 tip. We had a blast downtown, and look forward to going back!!!	
Jun 8 2007	Loved the Four Queens	From check in to check out the stay was awsome.We checked in at 7:30PM and sine I am a Diabetic I requested a refigerator for my medicine. We no more got to the room and the refigerator was there. The entire staff was great. The Magnolia was a great restaurant with very reasonable prices. Location Downtown was great. We normally saty at te Golden Nuggett but except for the ladies make up area the room was almost the same. The romms have been remodeled and had a flat screen TV ,new carpet and furniture. We satyed in the South Tower which was right next to the checkin area and casino.We stayed over the Memorial Day weekend and couldn't have been happier. Would definitely stay there again and plan on that on our next trip.	
Jun 5 2007 	Enjoyed our stay	We stayed 5 nights on the strip and booked the Four Queens for one night to experience the downtown atmosphere. It was nice to be able to check in early 1pm and check out late noon. Room was clean had 2 comfortable queen size beds, view of the strip and a new tv. Ate at Magnolia's twice and enjoyed both meals. Downtown has a different feel compared to the strip. It was more relaxed and friendlier. It was really nice to be able to walk from hotel to hotel within minutes. We liked the location and the price was $200 less than on the strip, so that was just another bonus. On the downside, we were woken up at 5am as a large drunk group of people tromped down the hallway - so we found the rooms are not particularily sound proof. We would be willing to stay here again, however we prefered the location at Bally's on the strip.	
May 21 2007	Vegas Baby!	Well lets just start out by saying my wife and I go to vegas every year for the last 7 and me for the past 12 years. We do stay at diffrent places and we do stay at places that we like more often. Now about the Four Queens as I said it was okay the rooms are small but clean we were unlucky and got the north tower too small and noisy and we asked for a non smoking room and got a smoking room . The Guy at the front was fast but he didn;t bother listening to what we had said or didn't hear us and he didn't even tell us how to get to the elevator. We of course went up the south tower and had to back track and after wondering the casino we found the elevators to our room.Everyone else was pretty friendly just a little small. My wife and I did decided we were not going to stay here anymore so if you need to save some money go somewhere else you'll like it better.We stayed from April 30 -May5	
May 15 2007 	Loved The Four Queens	We just spent our eight night honeymoon at the Four Queens and loved every minute of it. The rooms in the south tower are very clean and modern. The onsite 24hr restaurant Mangolias was subperb (hint- join the players club to recieve a big discount). I really have nothing bad to say about this wonderful downtown hotel.	
May 15 2007	Great Times	We stayed at the Four Queens 5/7 to 5/11 for our honeymoon and would come back again!. We loved the location best of all and enjoyed the great food at Magnolia's. We got a players club card and took advantage of the great discounts on food by using the card. We got a great rate online with an air package. We had a new room in the north tower on the 19th floor which was clean and comfortable. Yes, the bathroom is small but who cares when you've got live music every night outside and the action that is going on in the casino. This hotel is the way old Las Vegas use to be.	
May 13 2007 	Even better than last time!	This is the first visit where I had a renovated room. Great job! I generally stay downtown and the Four Queens is the main property I choose because of the location and value. On most trips, I also do most of my gambling at the Four Queens...great selection of table games and slots. I also saw a number of fairly large wins on this trip (not for me, unfortunately). Magnolia's Veranda is still a great cheap coffee shop with good food - you can't go wrong choosing the Four Queens for your vacation!	
May 13 2007	Just got Back!!!!	Jot got back this morning. Was there for our Ann. Everything was great. Rooms have been updated. Magnolia,s was very god, great service, food, and you have to get you Player,s Club Card, they offers discounts all the time. Ate at Hugo,s 2 times. The best. Cant belive that anyone would be dissapointed. You must try to stay there. The value is excellent. Nothing fancy, but with the friendly staff and location you cant beat it. Please try.	
May 6 2007 	Good value	We booked our hotel via the Four Queens website. Our room was $44.00/night and was very basic with a king size bed. The bathroom was small (not enough room for 2 people) but clean. The towels were thin and small but clean and readily available. Our room was clean and neat. In the room was a hair dryer, iron and board. Nothing fancy. Soap, shampoo and lotion were made available but the quality wasn't all that good. The a/c unit vent is up on the ceiling and goes on and off - no constant circulation and not quiet but not noisey either. We knew when it came on but not so loud that we couldn't sleep through it. Our room number was (North Tower) 1603. We were assigned an ajoining room and never knew we had neighbors. However, there was some noise from the street at night. Again, nothing we couldn't sleep through. We did not eat at the Four Queens, but when playing the slots the wait staff was pretty good about getting our drinks to us in a timely manner. The front desk staff and Royal Players Club staff were nice. Nothing over the top, but nice/friendly/helpful. When we needed a taxi the valet was helpful, but we had to ask the valet to get us a cab. He didn't ask us what we needed. He did not approach us, we had to approach him.Not sure if we would stay there again. The price was right and ultimately all we needed was a place to shower and sleep. However, we may try another hotel the next time we go out.	
May 6 2007	FOUR QUEENS~WHAT A BARGAIN WHAT A DEAL!!!	I recently stayed at the Four Queens for four nights (4/29-5/3) and have nothing to say but good things about this hotel. Rooms were recently renovated, new beds, bed coverings, carpets, drapes, tv, with an iron and ironing board, hair dryer, and coffeemaker in each room. Bed slept just wonderful (we had two queens... two ladies travelling together) the registration desk people were wonderful, and check in and check out were fast and pleasant. Magnolia's personnel were friendly, fast, and competent, the housekeeping was impeccable... as were the cage, players club, and gift shop personnel. The casino itself is well set up and attractive, and it has a lot of the up to date slots as well as some of the older ones. I didn't make a bundle at their slots, but... I had a wonderful time, and I saw people hitting good numbers. I just wasn't one of them. AND their prices for the rooms are really a great savings!! I will definitely go back! They have a safety deposit box for you at the front desk too~!	
May 4 2007 	Great!!!!	First time staying downtown but I got such a good deal on my package with Hotwire it was well worth it. I was in Room 1501 North, King size bed was good and also had a good shower and coffe maker. I did have one breakfest and dinner at Magnolia which was great. The rest of the time I spent at other down town casinos plus hit the strip every day. I can't wait to go back.	
May 2 2007 	Not even for the price	My husband and I, who usually stay on the strip decided to do the &quot;old-time Vegas thing.&quot; We wanted to stay on Freemont Street and booked the Four Queens based on recommendations made on this site - big mistake! Although I'd booked my room six weeks in advance, when we arrived, they had no non-smoking rooms available (I was staying for 7 nights). They reassured me that they would have one the next day. The person at the counter told me that they had remodeled to rooms and the smell shouldn't be that bad - it was!! Not only was there the disgusting smell of cigarettes, but then someone had sprayed a ton of cheap-smelling offensive floral deodorizer all over the room - when I opened the door it was enough to gag us both. We opened all of the windows (we were on the 19th floor), and left for two hours hoping the smell would be gone when we returned (it was 4 am when we got back). I requested to be transferred to a nonsmoking room the next day - I was told I could get a room on the 7th floor - right about the same height as the canopy, light, and music show. I knew this wasn't going to work as the noise from the show was loud on the 19th floor - I knew it would be intolerable on the 7th (I was in Vegas to work for four of the seven days and needed to be able to sleep). I requested a room in the other tower and was told there were none available and so were stuck for six nights (I tried to move to another hotel, but due to a convention there were none available for the duration of my stay). The bathroom was disgusting - the caulk was split and mould was growing in the cracks, and there were chunks of dust and dirt hanging from the ceiling vent. We asked to have the vent cleaned - it never was. We had no heat in the room and froze every night we were there. We complained about this several times to no avail. We really did not appreciate the evening we came back from hours of fun on the strip to a 60 degree room - I guess the maid was hot. We called the desk to complain about the cold and asked to have someone sent up (at 11pm) to check on the heat. The engineer said the air was on the heater was not, and there was nothing he could do. The staff, except for Anthony the valet, was not friendly at all, and most (including the ones at Magnolia's) seemed inconvenienced by our very presence. The final straw was that on the day we came back from the Hoover dam and all of the guest elevators in the hotel were out of service. We took a service elevator to our floor and were &quot;chewed out&quot; by a cleaning lady for using the elevator that was for service use only. When I explained that my husband, who walks with a cane, has a rod in his leg and is in no shape to walk up and down 19 flights of stairs, she said that wasn't her problem - nice huh?We spent most of our time at Fitzgeralds, the staff there was way friendlier, the food was better, and the slots were looser.I DO NOT recommend this hotel to anyone!	
Apr 29 2007 	Wonderful location Minimalist room	The Four Queens is a great place to base your Vegas vacation, but you certainly get what you pay for. The room is average sized, but the bathroom is downright tiny. The flat screen TV was nice, but we were disappointed at the channel selection. The bed is not at all comfortable, and the room made lots of funny noises at night. The walls are pretty thin as well.There was no line when we checked in which was wonderful. The staff was prompt with requests (more towels, fix TV, fix toliet). The casino was just OK. The craps dealers weren't as friendly as the ones at Binion's. The 24 hour restaurant is bad. We were much happier with the coffee shop at Binion's. We spent lots of our time at the Golden Nugget. The pool, great bartenders, and other amenities ensures that we will spend the extra money to stay there next time.	
Apr 23 2007	Hotel Stay	We stayed at the Four Queens on April 19 - 22, 2007. We picked this hotel because we got a deal on it. It was okay, the ventilation was terrible. A couple times, we waited about 20 minutes for an elevator and finally had to take the stairs. We went to eat at Magnolia's for breakfast and the waiter didn't know what coffee and Baileys was. He told me he would bring me water instead and we ended up leaving.The room was renovated and nice. However, the bathroom had hair all over it. The bathroom could use an update.Other than that, it was an okay hotel to stay at especially since all we did was sleep there.Getting to the Strip took about an hour each way.	
Apr 18 2007 	Average stay	We stayed there for one night. The price was great, but everything else was average. I didn't find the front desk staff to be very friendly, and the elevator waiting space was small and always very crowded.	
Apr 12 2007 	Mediocre experience!!!	I take my 79 year old mother to Vegas once per year. We have stayed on the strip and last year decided to try the DT area. Last year, we stayed at the Golden Nugget, which was fabulous. She likes to go DT now as it is so much smaller and easier for her to get around.This time we decided to try the Four Queens as they have boasted about renovating their rooms. I read good reviews from this site and was not too concerned. Our experience, however, was not the greatest. We were there from April 1-4, 2007.We were put into a room upon which when I went into the bathroom, a huge pubic hair was starring at from the toilet seat. Gross! Unacceptable! There was also long, black hair on the bathroom floor. I did not decide to request another room, however, until the toilet overflowed a few minutes later. YUCK!So, they put us in another room... no problem... until... that toilet overflowed too. It actually overflowed the following day. I suspect that the infostructure of that part of the city is just so old leading to plumbing problems. (At least there were no pubic hairs to be seen in this bathroom) I called about the toilet and they brought up some big and loud as crap machine to soak up the toilet water that made it's way out onto the carpet outside of the bathroom. They left the machine in the room for many, many hours while we were out gambling. When we got back to the room in the early morning the machine was still there roaring away. I unplugged it and put it out into the hallway. Was the toilet water drenched carpet dry? NO. It was better but certainly not dry. I suppose we could have changed rooms again but we were only going to be there for two more nights and my mother didn't want to bother with it. At least we had our house shoes to wear so our feet didn't have to touch that toilet water germ-filled carpet.The next day our A/C went out. I called about it and they sent someone up to correct the problem ASAP. It worked fine after that.I found the front desk staff to be very nice, friendly and helpful. Even though we had room problems, they were diligent about getting those problems corrected.We had fun in the casino but the the servers did not come around too often for drink orders. Had great luck at the ELVIS slot machine located near the players club desk. That machine seemed to be paying out the whole time we were there. I finally got a chance to get on it right before we left for the airport and won $160.00 playing pennies, not even max bet pennies, and still won. Might not sound like a lot but I am by no means a high roller and was happy to win that much. I only put $20.00 in.Had a blast at the BJ tables. Lost the first night but made up for it after that. We also played at Binion's which I love. Aways seem to find decent slot machines there and have a blast playing BJ. So, would I stay at the Four Queens again. NO. I would rather pay a bit more and stay at the Nugget. It is nicer and seems to be kept up WAY better than the Queens. Oh, one more thing, the rooms were indeed renovated and had the big screen TV. But, the choices of bedspreads and curtains were/are appalling. I know this might not matter to many people who read this but the fabric truly looked like it came straight out of the 1970's. Whoever was in charge of choosing those fabrics should be fired and required to go to interior design school. Look at the hotel photos on this site and you will see what I mean.	
Apr 3 2007	Enjoy Fremont Street	In the past few years, we generally stayed on the Strip. We started a yearly tradition where we meet our sister and brother in law in Vegas in May for her birthday. They had always stayed downtown, so we also booked a hotel downtown. We have stayed at the Four Queens Hotel for the last three years, and we have reservations again this year to stay 7 days. We like the convenience of downtown because there are casinos just outside of each other. As for the Four Queens, the rooms are clean and very very affordable.	
Mar 29 2007 	I had a great time!!	I was really worried that staying off of the strip was going to ruin my trip to Vegas--but i was wrong! We were there during the rodeo so all the hotels were booked, we got our reservation at the Four Queens which turned out to be a nice place to stay. The staff was very friendly and accomodating, and there was a great restaraunt right off the casino that was awesome! The Freemont Street Experience was really neat also. There were just tons of people enjoying the lights, music, drinks, and just having a great time together. I would recommend staying here if you don't want to be on the strip!	
Mar 28 2007 	Good Stay at the 4 Queens	I recently stayed in the 4 Queens with my wife for four days over Saint Patricks Weekend.The Hotel itself is perfectly adequate and is in a busy location ob Fremont Street.The Hotel itself is clean and boasts a huge casino floor downstairs.The food in the Hotel is also very good.The 4 Queens is a perfect Hotel if you want to basr yourself in the Downtown area of Las Vegas.	
Mar 26 2007 	Great downtown Hotel and casino	We enjoyed an excellent few days at the Four Queens in February. The check-in was excellent and quick. All of the staff were very helpfull and friendly. The room was very clean (unlike some other Vegas hotels) and well equiped. The casino was good and not too smoky when we were there. Could not do much gambling as we both caught flu on the flight over! If you are looking for a good downtown hotel with excellent room rates the Four Queens can be highly recomended. We will stay there again.	
Mar 25 2007 	An excellent room at a great price	My brother and I stayed at the four queens during our annual trip to Las Vegas during the first Week on the NCAA basketball tournament. I've stayed at the Four Queens before, and when I received a discount flyer in the mail, I decided to give them a try again. I was extremely pleased with our accommodations and the great price. We stayed in one of the remodeled rooms with queen beds and a flat screen TV. An exceptional value for such a wonderful clean room. The Four Queens staff was extremely helpful taking care of our every need. We especially appreciated the Four Queens location on Freemont Street. Within easy reach of other casinos and entertainment on Freemont Street, and A short cab ride to the larger casinos on the strip. I know that I will stay at the Four Queens next time I am in Vegas.	
Mar 12 2007 	great stay	location outstandingdining outstanding, great prices, great food.room outstanding, any requests quickly filled.gambling outstanding with the exception of drink service.i got in at 10 pm and was looking forward to a drink, unfortuneatly,no waitresses around. i figured it was because of a sunday nite. i mentioined this to a waitress on monday, and she took good care of me, and i her. come tuesday, wed, thursday, only time i saw a waitress was in the morning. because of this, four queens lost a lot of my gambling money to the new york club. sorry.great trip and four queens is awesome, i will return again, everyone at hotel was so kind otherwise.	
Mar 4 2007	Absolutely will go back!	We just came home yesterday from a 4 night stay at the Four Queens. We had a great time. Rooms were clean and maid service every AM. Five minutes to check in. We arrived about 4:30 pm. We ate several meals at Magnolias and they were all good. Significant price reduction if you have a players card. Sign up for card online before you go to Vegas and receive an extra free gift. We got Four Queens caps for pre registering. Everyone gets a nice deck of cards in a tin. Nice souvenir. We are already planning to go back. Everyone was friendly and waitresses were around a lot with the free drinks. Love Fremont Street. I felt very safe there, no riff raff. The strip was fun but a lot more walking involved.	
Mar 3 2007 	Great value.	My husband &amp; I stayed at the Four Queens for 2 nights in early February. We've stayed at a few different Las Vegas properties, but never downtown so we thought we would for a change. I read the reviews for the Four Queens and thought this would be a good deal. We weren't disappointed. The room rates were very affordable ($74 &amp; $44 through their website). Our room was on the 12th floor facing Fremont Street. We were a bit concerned about the noise coming periodically from the Fremont Street Experience, but it was fine. The rooms are on the smaller side, but nicely decorated and very clean. The bed was comfortable. We didn't have a flat screen TV in our room as some rooms do have, although it would have been nice, it wasn't important. We did have a coffee maker which to us is always a good thing. The only drawbacks to our room were the bathroom (very small), the lack of water pressure in the shower and a room safe.We ate most of our meals at Magnolia's in the hotel. Each time, the staff were very nice and the food was always good. Overall, we enjoyed our stay and would recommend this property to others.	
Mar 3 2007	Older But Very Comfortable	Antonio, Front desk was magnificent. check in was late-wanted to be of f Fremont St. (noise)- Wife is diabetic- Antonio Arranged for room with Refrigerator for insulin. Called to check on us after arrival in room. Good food (hugos cellar)-Magnolia coffee shop good also- Good gambling= small but Quaint- Would return- Like the laid back atmosphere of downtown'.	
Feb 22 2007 	Allstar Weekend at the 4 queens	We booked our trip through MLT. We only paid $260/person, which included flight from Tulsa and our room at the 4 queens. Check in was easy, we received adjoining rooms with no problems. Room was on the 14th floor, overlooking the Fremont Canopy. I have no complaints what so ever. It was clean and actually quiet, considering it being allstar weekend. It took about $16 to catch a taxi to the strip, the duece was $5 for a day pass. Did not eat inside hotel. Did go to Tony Romas...It was horrible, food was raw. Loose slots were at the Fitzgeralds. Plenty of entertainment right there, and you don't have to walk far to get to each hotel. I've always stayed on the strip at Imperial Palace or the Riviera, the Four Queens was better, and a better bargain, Save the money for gambling or to see a show(I recommend Princes' 3121 it was worth $125) If you like Prince, but if you cant afford that go see Purple reign the Prince tribute show for 5 bucks!	
Feb 7 2007	Friendliest Hotel In Vegas	My family used to stay at the Hilton during our 3-4 trips to Vegas a year. Then we discovered the great 4 QUEENS. Everyone that works at the 4 QUEENS treats you like family. The tables are exciting and the dealers and pit bosses are very accomodating and eager to teach you any game. The restaurants are top notch. HUGO'S CELLAR is a five star restaurant in the basement. The comps are the best in town. The best thing is the safety and security. My last visit I had my purse out in the open and the security people watching in the ceiling called the pit boss and asked them to move my purse so I didn't lose it. We will never go back to staying on the strip. There are also many options of casinos within 2 blocks to walk to for gambling and the exciting Fremont Street experience complete with concerts is outside the door each night. An exciting time and family friendly.	
Feb 3 2007 	The Class of Downtown	Stayed at the Four Queens recently. I got a renovated room and was very pleased. Everything was new, which is nice given that this is an older hotel. It's nice to see a hotel owner invest some $$ to improve their property! The room was very clean, too.The hotel and casino have an elegant look, all shiny and brassy.I really enjoyed the casino: the slot mahinces here are loose! I won small amounts on different machines, and also saw others winning, as well. They also had alot of full-pay video poker. I signed up for a players club card and got discounts in their restaurant, which overlooks the casino. Good food and good prices. Overall I was very pleased with the Four Queens and would stay, and play here again.	
Feb 3 2007 	Awesome Deal Nice Place	Why only 2 stars? This place ROCKS!I have stayed at almost every Vegas hotel, on and off the strip. This hotel is an AWESOME value. Decent, clean and newly renovated room. Very comfortable bed. Hotel diner was great breakfast. Casino was nice. Freemont Street is a great place, and you will have fun. Save some money on strip hotels and stay here, you won't be dissapointed and you won't have to wait 30 minutes to check-in or get your car from Valet. I have nothing negative to say about this place, and was pleasantly suprised.Downside- I stayed along Freemont in North tower. Freemont street music at 8am woke me up. If you want to sleep in ask for a room NOT facing the street. Plus I won $209 on a peny slot machine! Woo-hoo! Small rooms but again, very nice. this is a 3-star property nicer than Excalibut, Imperial, Riviera or other budget minded Vegas hotels.	
Jan 28 2007 	great hotel	we booked a hotel downtown as it was so expensive to stay on the strip at christmas.we were very surprised with how good the hotel was.we arrived late and checked in with no problems.our room was spacious and recently redecorated to a good standard.the bathroom was small but had a fantastic shower,which was hot and powerful.room had all the usual for a usa hotel,huge bed,coffee maker,large tv,iron,hairdryer,ect.rooms cleaned every day and fresh towels.our room was above the fremont street experience so every hour for ten mins until midnight was noisy,so,the next day we asked could we switch to a room across the hall so we wouldn't be over the light show which was done without any fuss.reception staff were very polite and helpfull.would stay here again.	
Jan 26 2007 	great deal and good service	november 2006 I stayed at the Four Queens with my brother and his lovely wife. We had a great time. Our rooms were clean and cozy. The Veranda cafe had great meals and prices. I loved to watch the tables while I enjoyed the 6.40 primerib, 4.00 burger and fries, and the 3.00 steak and eggs. The best rooms are in the tower facing the south side. The elevator was in the center of the casino and just a short walk to the main entrance to Freemont St. I would recomend this hotel. Make sure to join the player's club, this is how I got the good food deals.	
Jan 26 2007 	Pleasantly Surprised!	We usually stay on the strip, but got an unbelievable package deal to fly and stay at 4 Queens. Check in took about 5 minutes on a Sunday afternoon. Clerk very friendly. Hotel was booked for the night and we received a room on the 5th floor of the South Tower (Rm 533). Many people have commented on how slow the elevators are. They didn't seem to bad when we used them. Requested a non-smoking king bed and that's what we got. Opened door and room was great! Carpet was new, as was the bed, bedspread, lighting fixtures in bathroom and had a new flat screen TV. Room was updated with the exception of the bathroom. Looked like it could use a little paint and some upkeep. Bathroom was very tiny, but worked fine. Room was very large and looked toward the FSE. Could hear the shows a night, but since our tower was farther away, it didn't bother us at all.Ate at Magnolia's 3 times. Very good food and service. Also, if you sign up for the player card, there are a few specials that you can get. For $6.40 we tried the prime rib special and also the baby back rib special. Came with salad, rolls, beans and choice of potato. Very large portions and food was very good as well.Casino had for the most part friendly dealers at the BJ tables and a nice selection of slot machines. Drink service was good at the slots (even penny and nickel ones) and was excellent if you were at the tables.Overall I was very happy with our stay here and would definately recommend to others and stay here again.	
Jan 4 2007 	Good Stay - Great Downtown Location	We flew in from DFW on a Funjet charter. Took the shuttle bus ($12.00 per person) from the airport to the Four Queens. Check-in was a breeze. We were given room 1531 (a suite). It was a corner room overlooking the FSE. The room had two full size sofas, two arm chairs, coffee tables, end tables, a desk and chair, plus a fridge and a king bed. The bath had his and hers sinks and nice thick towels. The soap, shampoo and lotion were plentiful but not high end. There was a separate dressing area with a mirrored closet. We left the maid a $5 on the pillow each day and they took care of everything we needed. The casino is smokey but still fun. The dealers were for the most part friendly and fun. The cocktail service was excellent. The coffee shop, Magnolia's, is quite the bargain. Breakfast was $4.00 for your choice of ham or steak, two eggs, hashbrowns and your choice of toast, biscuits, english muffins, etc. Their dinner special was $6.40 for your choice of soup or salad, your choice of prime rib or baby back ribs, baked potato and the vegetable of the day. Again we had excellent service and a great bargain. This is not gourmet food but it is really good and you cannot beat the price. They also had a burger and fries special for $4.00 but we did not try it. We did see others who ordered it and it looked good if you were in the mood for a burger. You have to have a players card to get these speical prices. Just go to the promotions desk after you check in and sign up. Better yet, go on line to fourqueens.com and fill out their players club form, print it out, give it to them at their promotions desk and they will give you a nice Four Queens duffel bag/tote bag for free. Checkout is normally 12:00 noon but we asked if it would be possible to extend the checkout time. They let us check out at 1:00 PM instead. That extra hour made things much more convenient for us. We took a taxi from the FQ back to the airport and it was about $25 if I remember correctly. Overall, we had a great time at the Four Queens and would be happy to stay there again.	
Dec 28 2006 	Great Price and Great Hotel	I stayed at at the Queens Dec. 22 -24. It was better than I had expected. I had read the reviews on the construction and the rooms being dated. I was pleasantly suprised. Apparently they had updated some rooms. When I opened the door to my room I smelled the fresh scent of new carpet. The furniture smelled of new cherry wood. We came on a good day...the mattresses were very new too. The bathroom could have used some updating...but sowhat...it took care of my basic needs. An excellent breakfast and dinner value. Steak and Eggs for $4 and delicious Prime Rib for$6.40. I ordered the gumbo soup instead of the salad...oh my...it was breath taking. I have still have dreams on how tasty it was. Remember to get your players card cuz you will need it to get the reduced meal prices. We were casion hopping. The Queens by far gave the best quality t-shirt for a mear 40pts. Maid service was good. No complaints. The halls were not noisy. We probably paid $83 per night with a pkg purchased via Worry Free Vacations. Great location too. I plan on staying there again.	
Dec 20 2006 	Excellent Value - A Las vegas Hidden Secret!	My fellow travelers . . . Please dont let older reviews of this property discourage you from staying at this property. I think it is a hidden gem in the sea of Las Vegas hotels. My husband and I stayed here over the Thanksgiving weekend. Most room in this hotel have been recently remodeled and we received one of the new rooms. New carpet, paint and furniture and very clean.I think this hotel has the best location on Fremont street. A short walk to the main street if you wish to take the city bus to the strip, yet located right in the middle of Fremont Street itself. The hotel has a café style restaurant called magnolias and we were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food. You can also order Microbrew beer from their Brewery also located in the Hotel. The Microbrew restaurant (I cant remember the name for sure, but I think it was called Chicago Microbrew) also had excellent food and was a nice quit place to take a break. For a special treat, Hugos cellar is an excellent place for fine dining and one of the best places I think I have dined in Las Vegas.Last but not least we had the best luck in this casino for slot machine jackpots. I won $800 within the first 20 minutes I was there on the Wheel of Fortune Dollar machines located on the wall that faces Fremont Street. Our friends did very well on the poker machines located throughout the casino. Also the dealers were very friendly.After 25 years of visiting Vegas about three times a year, this has become our favorite hotel to stay at.	
Dec 6 2006 	Closest to street Hotel Rooms	Four Queens room 1501 in the North Tower was close to the elevator in the tower next to the Fremont Street Experience (FSE). You could close your hotel room door, take the elevator and be on the street within about 3 minutes and about 20 steps. This beats the block+ walk through Golden Nugget, Fitzgeralds, and Fremont to get to the street from their rooms. You could not really hear the FSE from the room, but you would on the rooms on the other side lower down. The window had a view of the Nugget and the other Queens tower and parking garage. The room is small about 15x25 total. The window is about 4x15. The bathroom is about 6x 9 and a large closet about 2.5x 5.5. The main room is about 15x15. The furniture is classy mahogany looking including 2x4 table, two table chairs, TV stand with 2 drawers, 2 night stands with 2 drawers, and one king bed. The closet doors are mirrors. The room has central air, alarm clock, hair dryer, standard hotel 3 cup drip coffee maker, $0.75 phone calls, good wireless internet $11.99 per day and room food service. Like most LV hotel rooms the lights were too low of wattage to read. Magnolias Café has excellent food and specials. There is a pizza place and coffee, donuts, ice cream parlor hidden in the corner where Burger King and sushi bar used to be. Maid service was polite, detailed, and excellent. The small 24 remote Philips TV had in room movies. The zip code for the online Yahoo TV schedule is 89101 and Cox Communications (digital) is the cable provider. The room TV stations are:2.KVBC local3.NBC KVBC local5. Fox KVVU local6. CNN 20 Atlanta7. Keno8. CBS KLAS local9. TBSP Atlanta10. PBS KLUX11. CNN- 22 Headline News12. ESPN 3013. ABC KTNV local15. KINC 15 Spanish16. Hotel Dining17. Hotel Gaming23. Movie PreviewsThe North Tower has red key cards and the South Tower has purple. The ice machines in th North Tower are on floors 2, 9, 10, 12, 16, 18, and 19 while the soda machines ($1.50 coin) are on floors 5, 8, 11, 15, and 17.I will stay in the North Tower again since it is so close to the street and other casinos. The room was closer to the front doors and casinos of the Fremont, Binions Horseshoe, and Golden Nugget than the rooms in their own hotels. The down side was the central air could not get the room temperature below 70F easily and the small room and bathroom size. The room check in (on Sundays to get keys to go into the room) could not be before 2 PM and room not guaranteed clean until 4 PM so use the bell hop and wait around with a dirty room or forget the early arrival flight on Sundays. On Monday I saw people checking in starting at 8:30 AM. There was a new airport boarding pass printing machine near the reservation desk for about $1 per minute plus $0.50 per page.	
Nov 29 2006 	Excellent Value for Money	I booked a 7 night stay via a UK Website, and was a bit wary after reading reviews abouth this hotel.I was pleasently surprised when checked into my room ,it was recently refurbished and was extremely pleasant, the housekeeping was exceptional, and by joining the players club I obtained excellent discounts in the restaurant....upto 65% wow!	
Nov 13 2006 	Excellent Value	We just returned Nov 11th from a 7 night stay at the Four Queens. Our room was in the North Tower #516 facing Freemont St. just under the canopy. The room was recently renovated very nice, very comfortable bed and very clean. Maid service was timely each day. The room was small especially the bathroom and as you entered the room other than that area it was fine. I was concerned with noise from the street but most nights after a busy day in Vegas we never had any trouble sleeping. We ate breakfast most days at Magnolias and had a couple of dinners as well with the players card breakfast was very reasonable and all meals were very good. We had rented a car this trip and parking was easy and free. It was another great trip and I would recommend the hotel and would stay again. Previously most of our visits have been at the Golden Nugget.	
Nov 8 2006 	Not too bad!	My first trip to Vegas was in September of 2005 my second was for New Years 2005 into 2006. Both times we stayed at the Four Queens. My friend goes to Vegas at least twice a year, most of the time at the Four Queens, so he has a lot of comp and is always invited for special promos. Overall the hotel really isn't that bad. Sure it is older and there are definitely places they could improve. But as long as you don't go there expecting the Four Seasons you will be fine! The rooms were clean, big enough for both of us to spread out. The bed was nice and comfy (king size), everything worked in the bathroom LOL We were a little worried about the noise levels as for the New Years trip our room was looking over Fremont, right under the canopy to the right of the 4Q's sign (from the standpoint of the hotel) From other reviews I read that the noise was really bad on that side. But I am happy to report that it really wasn't bad! Once we shut the window we really couldn't hear anything. One thing we did notice, there was a LOT of static electricity in the room! We attributed it to being directly under the canopy. I would def stay here again, Downtown is more my speed!	
Nov 6 2006 	Nothing to write home about	We just returned from a 5 day trip to Las Vegas and we stayed the 4-Queens Hotel and Casino on Fremont Street and I must say that I would not stay there again even with the daily rate of $50. The hotel is shabby and showing its age (even with the renovations that are going on). Our room was comfortable, but the bathroom as so small one could barely move in it and the bathtub had mildrew all the way around the edges. The furniture was cheap and there was cigarette burn marks on the carpet and comforter. And I would not recommend this hotel or area if you are under 65 years of age. Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against the elderly, but if you are looking for a rockin good time, DON'T stay on Fremont streetOn the up side...the staff was incredible!	
Nov 3 2006 	Good for the buget gambler	My wife and I spent 10/30 &amp; 10/31 at the 4 Queens, first time there, and we were pleasantly surprised.First off, this is not a 4 star property, but you get what you pay for (and in our case nothing, since we got our stay comped for our play, which is GREAT!). So if you want resort quality, stay on the strip if you can afford over priced rooms.Our room was OK, nice king bed, enough room, the bathroom a bit small, but we only got the $49 a night room, so that is expected. Old looking, but most of downtown in old looking, thats kinda of the charm of it. Old Vegas feel, before Meg Resort Boom. We were on the first floor of south tower (newer tower), so the elevators werent an issue for us. Hugos was very nice place to eat for the price ($100 for 2). Had a better meal there than at the Eiffel tower at the Paris (but without the great views).Casino was nice, not huge so you can get lost, be enough open tables and slots (could use a poker room). All TITO slots, not too tight and low table mim gave us a lot of play for our budget. Mostly friendly dealers and staff, small enough were the Hosts and Dealers would remember your name (and get better comps that way). Just a few steps outside to Freemont St and all the other downtown properties (and right next door to the Golden Nugget), so you could take an easy walk to another property and not worry about anything. Id rate it 2nd best on Freemont Street, right behind the Golden Nugget, which is probably the crown jewel of Downtown Vegas. Hopefully get to stay there again (or maybe try out the Nugget next time).To sum up, great place to stay for a short trip to downtown Vegas, just dont expect anything like the Mega resorts on the strip.See ya next time in Vegas, baby..:-)	
Nov 1 2006 	Nice Surprise!	Stayed there the last weekend in Oct. The overall upkeep of the hotel and the rooms were quite well. The rooms exceded what we expected and are still being upgraded with flat screen tv's.What is real nice is the 4 Queens has one of the show tciket sellers on property where you can buy tickets for any show in LV.The only complaints were that the daytime cocktail waitresses seemed quite rude as a whole and there was not much winning going on at the slots. Also, the resturants are fair at best and attitudes were disappointing. However, restaurants in the Fremont strip area are very good and you can't eat and drink cheaper than on Fremont.This was my first time on Fremont and I wouldn't hesitate to do it again, a great deal and very easy to get around. You can always drive up to the &quot;big strip&quot; if you want.	
Oct 17 2006 	Great for the Price	My husband and I stayed at the Four Queens from October 12 - 16th. While it is not a five star property, it certainly exceeded our expectations, particularly after reading some of the reviews on this site. The staff was attentive and met our expectations. The first night, we smelled a lot of cigarette smoke in the room (despite being on a non-smoking floor). The next day we asked to be moved and were given another room on a different floor without any hassle at all. The rooms (both of them) contained king sized (quite comfortable) beds. They were clean and reasonably well-kept (although somewhat showing their age). We also enjoyed gambling here - they do actually have one $2 blackjack table and you can often get on, if you don't mind waiting for a bit of time. I am new to blackjack and didn't want to spend lots of money learning the ropes. Don't bother with the breakfast (even the $4 special rate if you become a players club member)...the $5.99 buffet (weekdays) at Main Station far exceeds anything you can get at the Four Queens and includes juice and coffee (unlike the $4 breakfast special at the hotel restaurant). All in all, we will stay here again, without hesitation.	
Sep 15 2006 	Good Value for Price	We stayed at the 4 Queens from Thursday, Aug 31 through Monday, Sept 4. We loved it. This is an older hotel and lacks the glitz of the strip hotels. But it is inexpensive and has its own type of charm. The staff was very friendly - never heard a cross word from anyone. It was extremely busy and everyone was very friendly.The room was very clean and the cleaning service was always prompt.No complaints - will book here next time we do Vegas.	
Sep 5 2006 	The only good thing was the food	We reserved a non-smoking room. My husband is allergic to cigarette smoke. Upon arrival we were told that there were no non smoking rooms left but there was one smoking room available that had recently been remodeled. They would move us to nonsmoking the following morning. The first room had nice decor, was a comfy room overall, but it still smelled of stale cigarette smoke. We would have happily stayed in that room if the smell had not been there.They moved us to a nonsmoking room after being reminded that they needed to do so the next night and the bed in the second room honestly felt like two box springs on top of each other. We asked to be moved and were told they had rented out all the other nonsmoking rooms. We asked if the mattress could be switched out (another employee had told us 4Q was renovating all the rooms and new mattresses were available, all we had to do was ask) and were at first told this would be no problem. Got to the room to wait for the new matress and were then told that this could not be done because &quot;only engineers are qualified to do that&quot;. We complained again and miraculously they found us another nonsmoking room with a bed that was not quite so bad but still both of us woke up with aches and pains. There were holes in the towels, sheets, and pillowcases as well in the third room. There were also gouges in the drywall of the room and lukewarm water. The staff acted like they could have cared less for the most part about any of our concerns. Also, don't fall for the time share people in the lobby. We were told that if we went on their sales pitch tour we would get sixty dollars cash. We were thinking of getting a time share eventually anyway so this sounded pretty good to us. And it was a free trip around Vegas so why not! The voucher we received was not redeemable for cash, hotel credit only. When we complained to the supervisor he seriously rolled his eyes at my husband. We ended up using the voucher to eat at Magnolia's, the 24 hour restaurant inside the very smoky casino (they have a glass wall seperating the casino from part of the nonsmoking section), and had a great meal. Service in the restaurant was wonderful too. We also tried the pizza place and really liked the food there. I would some it up as poor customer service in a run- down hotel. Their slogan is &quot;The class of Downtown&quot; but we sure didn't see that at all. They need to start renovating at warp speed or change their slogan. Either way we won't be back.	
Sep 5 2006 	Would not recommend	To begin with, the hotel is far from a 3 star. At the most it is a 2 star. Second, the hotel is run down and old. Needs to be either torn down or renovated. Rust stains in shower, cracked tiles in the bathroom, hair in the sink, carpet was stained, are just a few of the features we found not so desirable. We were given an adjoining room with noisy neighbors that felt it was ok to smoke on the non-smoking floor. It was so bad by the 3rd night of our trip that the smoke was seeping underneath the adjoining door and was making our room hazy. When the front desk was notified, they simply let us know that they could not tell people what to do in their rooms. That was absurd. Upon checkout, we asked for a manager and notified him about our complaint, but we were blown off as well. We let him kindly know that we would not be staying at their hotel in the future. Point is, if you ask for non-smoking at any establishment, if someone lights up a smoke next to you in the non-smoking section, they will be asked to put it out, after all, it is the non-smoking section. Apparently, this hotel does not see it that way.	
Jul 22 2006	Not good	This hotel is not good at all. The bed is dirty, and the bathroom is bad. We used to leave tips at every hotel, but this one, no way!	
Jul 17 2006	Satisfactory Room for the Price Great Location	Compared to some of the reviews I've read, I want to give this hotel five stars for beating my low expectations--let's face it, I was a little frightened after Hotwire revealed the name of the hotel. but don't believe the bad reviews. I stayed in the North Tower, on the 8th floor- exactly level with the &quot;fremont experience.&quot; I don't know what noise people were complaining of- it was fine. and the lights were pretty through the sheers, and completely hidden when the heavy curtains were pulled. The room was clean, the furnishings not fashionable but decent and in good repair, and the linens were surprisingly soft, great pillows even. The staff were friendly and kind, and I even had a housekeeper interrupt me from returning to my room after brunch to warn me that she hadn't straightened my room yet, and would I like her to do it now.... The place is NOT a three star, probably a 2.5. The Days Inn comes to mind. And the only thing the TV is good for is for puchasing videos- it can do nothing else. but unless you're staying at the Nugget (was sold out) what else might you expect downtown? it's not posh, but it's a Vegas experience for a bargain. Further, you can take the Deuce ($2 double decker bus) down to the Strip- which CAN take forever in traffic, but good views along the way- which is all of a 3-4 minute walk from the hotel front door, THROUGH the Fremont experience. If you haven't been, picture an outdoor shopping outlet with panels way aloft that provide the show in the evening but provide reasonable shade during the day--there are speakers playing a variety of music mounted on posts every 50 feet or so, and as you walk what is essentially a pedestrian mall between the casinos, you'll run into street performers (artists and the like) and vendors of every touristy/mall sort. and don't forget the guys selling cocktails on the street- big plastic yard-long margaritas. So the woman who wrote that you get to the bus through a scary part of town clearly got lost. (how?) Magnolia's is not what people have made it out to be, but prime rib for $6- edible. The breakfast was much better. All in all, so much better than I had anticipated. And perhaps one of the BEST parts about the hotel room? I requested a non-smoking room and I got it. No trace of the scent to be found, and that IS a sticking point with me. I am pleased with my experience overall and wanted to set the record straight, because the 4 Queens is getting a reputation it doesn't deserve.	
Jul 16 2006	Good Value Nice Staff	I really enjoyed my stay at the Four Queens. My husband plays there from time to time, but not really that much, and we got three nights free and the fourth for $24 by calling and asking what we could get on his player's card. The staff were nice and efficient, the dealers at the blackjack tables were particularly friendly (they swung my husband a free meal at Magnolia's, about a $50 value, despite play that was lower than required for that comp).The rooms are at about a 2-1/2 star level, clean, few have views worth looking at, and are some of the only rooms in Vegas with coffee makers. Having a 1/2 price ticket booth in the lobby is a plus and is centrally located downtown. I'm looking forward to my next stay here.	
Jul 8 2006	4-Queens 	We stayed the first two nights of our trip on the strip at the Aladdin. Then stayed two nights at the 4-Queens. Upon arrival I felt as if I were home. The stress of the crowds and walking that accompanies the strip were gone. We arrived earlier than check-in time. They gave us a room anyway. We were put on the 6th floor next to the elevators. With a view of the roof but, who goes to Vegas to look out the hotel window! Unlike some reviewers that states problem with noise. We had two quite nights. The room was a bit small but, clean and comfortable. Maid service, like the rest of the staff was excellent! As for no doorman or bellhops. I did not receive these services at the Aladdin either and the room price was much higher. Gambling in all the downtown casinos was more favorable. If your looking for a posh hotel, stay on the strip. Just make sure to bring plenty of $$$. If your looking to beat the stress and the crowds make the smart choice. Stay downtown at the 4-Queens!!! We seen Gordie Brown next door at the Golden Nugget. Excellent show! The best of the 4 we seen. Proving the 4-Queens and downtown has it all!!!	
Jun 19 2006	A room is just a place to sleep	We stayed with another couple over Memorial Day weekend, so we chose 4Q because of the price. We ended up on the 10th floor with a perfect view of the top of the Fremont Street Experience. As this is an older hotel, the windows aren't sealed as well as newer hotels....we could hear the very early morning street cleanup as well as music rolling from the casinos floors through the windows. The beds were clean but not entirely comfortable, the floors were not filthy but worn, and the bathroom was small. The shower was very small...needless to say, a hotel room is just a place to sleep and that is exactly what we got. Nothing more, nothing less.	
Jun 17 2006	Great place to stay!	We returned from Las Vegas June 2 after staying 3 nights at the Four Queens. I loved staying on Fremont St. and the hotel was great. The rooms were nice and clean and they included irons, coffeemakers and a hair dryer. The staff was friendly and the service was good. My fiancee and I spent most of our gambling time at the Four Queens. We did look at other places nearby but for nickel video poker the Four Queens is the place to play. The waitresses brought us drinks regularly (all you have to do is give them a nice tip and they keep coming back). Another pleasant surprise was the comps. We came home withe duffel bags, t-shirts etc. We were also treated to a few free meals at Magnolia's Veranda. Next time I plan to go back I will stay at the Four Queens again.	
Jun 13 2006	No Problems at Four Queens	I stayed 3 nights at the Four Queens with 4 friends. We has an excellent time and was treated well. The Trip Advisor user that stated it as being typical Holiday Inn fare was very accurate. It was clean, comfortable and good value for the price. There are no doormen or bellhops, you just need to be able to take care of yourself. If you want more you will need to go elsewhere. Slots were good, they were a little looser than the strip, the Nugget and the Plaza.	
Jun 5 2006	Nice change for a night	There's absolutely nothing wrong with the Four Queens. I'm just more of a Strip kind of person. But we spent one night at the Four Queens to get the &quot;downtown experience.&quot; It was fun. Excellant location right on Fremont Street.The man at the front desk was very pleasant and helpful. We didn't really enjoy lugging our bags through the casino, but that's probably not uncommon. The room was very clean, maybe a little smokey but it gave an old-time Vegas feel. The shower was the absolute best I've ever had ... I must have stayed in there for 30 minutes.Overall, the Four Queens is a great deal if you don't mind staying off the Strip. We got one night for $35. Its right in the middle of the downtown action.	
Apr 5 2006	Great view	My husband and I just returned from a weekend at the Four Queens. We had a room at the top with a wonderful view of the mountains!! We awoke every morning to music floating up from the Freemont Experience. A older hotel, but very comfortable.	
Mar 28 2006	pleasantly surprised	The rooms were small but very clean. We were there for four days and the beds and towels were changed every day. Bathroom cleaned. Front desk very friendly. We would go back there again.	
Feb 25 2006	Very Pleasantly surprised!	A good price was our objective when booking three rooms at the 4 Queens for a one night stay in the middle of a three day weekend. We were pleased to find updated rooms, pleasant staff and two rooms were even upgraded to to accommodate our no smoking request. The downtown area was a fun reminder of the past and the hourly street scene performance was great. All three couples agreed that they would return. Only negative is that the elevators are a bit on the slow side, but think of all the money you aren't spending while waiting.	
Dec 13 2005	I'll stay again	This was me and my boyfriend's first time outside of Iowa. We were going to Vegas to get married. We booked with Four Queens because of the price. We were very happy. Our maid was excellent and the service was great. May I suggest the pizza from Old Chicago?	
Nov 16 2005	first trip to vegas	My wife and my first vacation without kids-ever! Stayed at 4 queens through an mlt deal. Was really affordable and a lot of fun. Having stayed downtown and since then, on the strip, i'll take downtown every time! The Queens was lively, friendly, and the room was clean. The front desk was very helpful even making sure we had a ride to the airport when we had to leave. Didn't win any money but hit lots of quads and had a great time. if you like to gamble, this is the location. We never ate at the Queens, but everything else was great. Not only will I stay there again I'll be there in January.	
Nov 6 2005	Nice Hotel	This was a nice hotel. The check-in was very quick and the staff was very nice. The only complaint I had was the rank smell the room had. It smelled so bad we had to Febreeze it several times to get the stench out.Overall, a good place to stay for the price and it's right on the Fremont experience which was amazing.	
Oct 13 2005	Best in the West!!	We have been staying at the Four Queens for quite a few years now and we love it, wouldn't stay anywhere else!!	
Oct 10 2005	Ok for 29 bucks...	Stayed here in room 819 on a Tuesday night booked directly through the hotel website for 29 bucks. Check in was less than a minute. Casino is easy to navigate and elevators for both towers easy to find. No security whatsoever checking keys at the elevators. Room was smaller than average motel 6. Bed was similar to sleeping on the floor in comfort level. TV had about 6 or 7 channels. I ended up watching the hotels ammenity channel over and over because the goon and his wife featured were funny to watch. They were SO excited to be at this hotel, it was comical. The worst part of this room was the bathroom. It was the smallest I have ever had. The missing shower tile had been placed on the toilet tank, probably by a guest years previous. The shower drain backed up in less than a minute so you would be mid calf deep in water. The water temp and pressure sucked big time. If you turned the temp up to a decent level, the plumbing behind the wall would vibrate VERY LOUDLY. This would continue to get progressively worse until the knob was backed off enough to give you a nice refreshing ARCTIC BLAST. It would cycle like that throughout the shower. I would not stay again, regardless of the 29 dollar Tuesday. As a side note, the Chicago Brewing Company located inside the casino has excellent pizzas and beer.	
Oct 4 2005	Four Queens-Great place to experience Fremont Street	We stayed at the Four Queens for two nights. We had stayed on the Strip previously and wanted to try downtown this time. We weren't disappointed. We got a great rate on the room. Since the previous reviews weren't that good, we were quite surpirsed at how nice the rooms were. We were on the fourth floor and there wasn't much of a view but we were there to see Vegas, not look out the window. Check-in was fast, parking was free since we were guests. The room could have used new carpeting but other than that, everything was fine. We drove to other casinos without having to drive the strip with no problem. Nice being able to gamble, go out and see the light show and go back to gambling again. Would recomment the Four Queens to anyone who is on a budget and wants a nice, clean place to stay. We'll be going back again.	
Sep 28 2005	Great Value	I was initially leary of booking the Four Queens based on mixed reviews, but was very pleased. The location is excellent and the staff friendly and accomodating. We had 11th floor North Tower (over top of Fremont Experience) and heard no noise at all..even with the live bands playing on the corner and the &quot;Experience&quot; playing every hour. The room was a little worn, ie., stains on the chairs...but overall adequate. As has been said before, the only drawback was no pool which I like for a break from gambling. Playing the tables with $5-$15 bets got us most of our meals comped.	
Sep 19 2005	Good Value	We spend a night here during Memorial Day Wknd. Had a great view of freemont street and the light show from our window. The room was small but clean and had an ironing board. The bathroom was clean though somewhat cramped. The price was right for the stay, I wouldnt stay here again as there's no pool and I need more space, however if you want a clean place to just lay your head for a night, this may be a good place for you.The staff is friendly, the casino is nice though smokey and the restaurant downstairs is really great, hugos cellar.	
Sep 5 2005 	A good value friendly staff	On of my two choices when staying downtown on my frequent trips into Las Vegas. I travel on business, but do drop a few bucks in the casinos during my down time and choose 4 Queens or Fitzgeralds for about 80% of my visits. Both hotels have their pros and cons. The 4 Queens has, by far, the better front desk staff...friendly and accomodating (can't say that about most of the staff at the Fitz). Rooms are clean, although a bit outdated, and comfortable with the basic ammenities. The shower generally has poor water pressure and the bathrooms are overall smaller than they should be. Lower floors in the North Tower can be less than peaceful at night during the Freemont St Experience shows so don't plan on a early night's sleep...the noise drops off around midnight...but hey, this is Vegas...who's in their room at midnight (me, unfortunately...when there's business to take care of the next AM). A gift shop near the front desk is open late and 24 hrs on weekends.There is a Subway/Noble Romans Pizza/TCBY location off the lobby, a 24 hour cafe with quality food at reasonable prices, a Chicago Brewing Company with a variety of beers and pizza, and Hugo's Cellar which is a mainstay downtown and known for it's fine dining experience. The casino is small but offers great variety with a wide range of monetary denominations. Dealers are friendly and helpful. The players club is probably the best cash-back program downtown but any comps must go through a host or pit boss.Overall, a good value for the money. For those wishing to stay in the coziness of downtown...4 Queens isn't a bad bet.	
Aug 29 2005	Good stay for a very low price!	We didn't expect much as we had only payed 20 Euro for the night at the 4 Queens. Therefore, we were happy with what we got. The staff at reception was very friendly and helpful to us! The room didn't appear too inviting, it was small with a very small bathroom, kind of old and worn - but clean! For hotel guests the parking garage costs $ 3,- when you show the ticket at reception. We spent one day and night in Downtown which we found enough to see what you have to (Fremont St. Experience, Casinos, restaurants, street musicians).For such a short stay we would come back to the 4 Queens, was a gread deal for the money.	
Aug 17 2005	Excellent for the price	We went on a weekday so the noise from Freemont street wasn't too bad. But I imagine that Weekends would be very noisey very late. Our room was on the 5th floor of the North tower so our window overlooked Freemont street, and was just under the Canopy that covers the street, which is really cool at night with all the lights of Old Las Vegas. If you want silence then ask for a room in the South tower. The room was Smaller than some but still big enough not to be climbing over your partner. The carpet was clean and looked fairly new as was the paint and the bathroom looked as though it may have been remodeled recently. The bed was comfortable. The chairs, desk and table looked a little older.As for location the only drawback is that you are not on the strip. However, it's a relief not to walk a mile from the elevator to the casino, and then another mile to get to the next casino. Exiting our elevator we were 5 feet from the casino. 20 feet from Fremont street. All the casino's are packed in next to each other. So you can hit the next casino in two minutes time. I would definetly stay here again.	
Aug 14 2005	Fun Time!!!	I usually stay on the strip, or at the Rio, but I decided to stay at The Four Queens for convenience to watch the LED ZEPAGAIN concert on August 9th. The room was small, but recently remodeled. In fact, they were working on the surrounding rooms while I was there. The staff was friendly, I had great luck on the VP machines, overall a very good time. I would not hesitate to stay there again if there is entertainment I am interested in. If you like to party, and hit numerous bars/casino's and then walk a short distance to your room, this is the place to be.	
Jul 28 2005	pretty good stay for the money	The Four Queens was a pretty nice place to stay if your budget minded, and don't care about the little things. Personaly I am a house keeper and I know the ins and outs of the hotel busness. The room was small but that I didn't mind, but the first thing when I walked into the room is that I smelled smoke. This would be ok if I smoked but I don't. The floors and the bathroom were just about spotless! The tub seemed to be washed out everyday, which is nice. But the sheets on the beds where not changed everyday (which is a standered at the hotel I work at, and I am a stickler for). For all the money I expect goes through a hotel/casino I kinda expect the desk chairs and blankets, etc to be in better shape. Check in was so quick and the frontdesk attentents where very nice. We came in really early and they had a room right away for us. The only thing about them I didn't like is that I asked for a hair dryer and I didn't get it. It's a nice place to stay if you want somthing quiet too! I slept rather well! Our room had a decent view of adjacent casinos (i could see the desert but i had to hang part of my body out the window) But if you want to play on the strip and your a cheep person i wouldn't advise to stay downtown. the taxi fare ranges $1o-$25. and i can't stress this enough make sure your driver understands the place you tell them to take you to! I've had this happen and the bill came to about $25! In closeing don't expect somthing lavish! they don't have any internet service, nore complete cable, and don't expect a fancy room, and theres not breakfast.But my boyfriend on the other hand thinks it's perfect.	
Jul 28 2005	4 Queens Great For The Price!	I needed a place to stay for one night before my reservations at Lake Las Vegas as I got into town early. It had been about 3 years since I had been downtown so I thought I would give it a try and the price was great. For $26 our room over looked freemont street. We were under the canopy so were able to see the light shows from the room before we went down to roam around. The room had the basic furnishings and is old, but it was clean. The bathroom is very, very tiny but had everything. The only downfall to the room was the fact that it was noisy due to being under the canopy. All the staff was very friendly and helpful. I did not eat at any of the restaraunts so can't comment on them. If I am ever in need of a place for a night or two and don't want to spend a fortune for a room I am never in anyway, I will book the 4 Queens.	
Jul 19 2005	not what we ask for	seven of us ladies, visited four queens, downtown las vegas, in april, 2005.we reserved three rooms, ask for the same floor, now smoking. we good three different floors, smoking rooms, very few towels, not real happy with our rooms. the hall way to the elevator was not clean and was HOT, as well as not able to get ice and vending machines on each floor. I would not stay at four queens again.	
Jul 19 2005	4 queens is awesome for the price	our stay at the 4 queens was outstanding. check in was fast and the rooms were a decent size and verry clean. the only downside to this hotel was their is no pool. it was only a 11 - 15 $ taxi ride to the strip. it was in a great location downtown and was verry reasonably priced. the food in the resturant was excelent. we all had the prime rib special they had and was awesome. over all it was an awesome place to stay and would deffinatly stay here again if i wanted to stay downtown. but this next time im going to las vegas in sept we r going to stay on the strip and take a chance at the westward ho which i read som mixed reviews on.	
Jul 19 2005	You must be kidding	I can't believe that anyone would stay at this place more than once. Rude and indifferent front desk staff who claimed we had no reservation. When we produced a printed confirmation we were met with hostility and a &quot;oh alright&quot; attitude and given a room that was not even made up. Dirty bathrooms and a nice view of the roof and garage. Our embarrassed but kind bellman pulled some strings with someone he knew in housekeeping to get someone up there because he said the front desk would ignore it. If you like cigarette smoke this place is for you.The valets were non-existent, especially when it came to picking up your car. Plan on about 45 minutes for that. Bedroom furniture that looked liked they scoured the local Salvation Army with worn faded bedsheets . All yours for $79.99!Our advice? Try the Fremont or California. Cheaper, Nicer and very clean.	
Jul 7 2005	Great Experience	I stayed at the 4 Queens late March of this year for a few days with my sister and father. I paid a budget price and was pleasantly suprised. I am a travel agent, and while I will still recommend this as a budget property, I think that of all of the cheaper downtown properties, it is worth the money paid. The front desk staff were very helpful, storing our luggage on the day of arrival until check-in time, and allowing us a late checkout the day we left.The beds were comfortable, the bathrooms clean. The restaurant open 24hrs was standard, chicken fingers, hamburgers but very good. Overall I had a great time In Vegas and it was nice to have a clean, comfortable place to lay my head.	
Jun 15 2005	OK But You Get What You Pay For	My wife and I stayed here over Memorial Day weekend. It was OK, but I would not stay here again. We checked in and went up to our room, which had a lovely view of the roof-top air conditioning unit on the building next door. Wallpaper was peeling off the walls, and had obviously been poorly patched in the past. The bedspread had cigarette burns in it. The cold water in the bathroom sink would not shut off. I ended up turning it so much that it broke - we had to call maintenance. There were not enough plugs near the back of the bed, so we had to make a choice: 1 light on each side of the bed, or 1 light total and the clock. We ended up moving the clock to the plug where the coffee maker was across the room, but that meant resetting it everytime the wall switch was shut off from near the door. I called about that to see if they could get me an extension cord with multiple outlets, but was told, &quot;Yep - that's the way our rooms are.&quot; Parking is $3 / day for hotel guests.On the plus side, the room was by far the cheapest available anywhere that I could find (except for the skanky no-name motels). Also, it is very well situated to take advantage of everything downtown has to offer. If I had to do it over again, I'd try the Fitzgerald or spend a bit more and stay at the Golden Nugget.So, you get what you pay for. If all you are looking for is a place to crash just for sleeping, then this might do the trick. If you are looking for more, you'll need to spend more and go elsewhere.	
Jun 12 2005	four queens downtown	stayed at four queens for two weeks in may 2005.great hotel for price, we got $44 per night.not one negetive to say about staff,very friendly.all in all great holiday got royal flush twice on vidio poker so as macarthur said we will be back.thank you all@four queens	
May 25 2005	Want an average place to stay?	I was hesistant to book this reservation in downtown Las Vegas, but it was the cheapest rate that I could find for a weekend rendezvous. Driving through downtown LV to get to the hub of the Fremont Experience is pretty scary and ugly. However, when you get past the ugliness and enter the area of the major downtown LV hotels (Fremont Experience) it gets a lot better. The front desk was nice and the standard room was average. The best part about this hotel was that the Fremonet Experience was just outside the casino doors. Overall, it is an average place to stay where you can find lots to do right outside the casino doors.	
May 14 2005	Expected more....	When you think of Vegas and all of the revenue the hotels make, you think that no matter where you stay, you will get a decent room and good service as VEGAS commands it - or so you would think.Four Queens was a bit of a disappointment. This was my first time staying downtown after 4 times on the strip.Do not get me wrong, staying downtown was a great time and we never even made it to the strip this time around but we were expecting more out of the hotel. This is no &quot;ALADDIN&quot;.The location downtown though could not be beat. Right in the heart of it all. Nothing downtown takes too long to walk. DO NOT walk past the Fremont strip at night however. DANGER!We checked in very late on a Monday night.We walked into the room and - well....The chairs had stains all over them. The room was smaller than we expected even though we were not planning on being in there too much.The problem was the age and cleanliness. The washroom taps were loose and the bathroom fan that never went off when the light was on was very loud and annoying.The hotel really needs an overhaul.You cannot count dirty rooms and bed bugs as part of the &quot;old charm&quot;.Yes I said bed bugs.We had a room on the 9th floor due to this but were moved after we said something to the 7th floor.This was much better but still - we were not compensated at all in any way.The cafe for breakfast was good - we went there once but slow service.There are a few tables and OK slots but we had a better time at many of the other casinos.If you are big on CLEAN this hotel may not be for you. I give it 3 stars as at least we got to change rooms and the place was affordable with a great location.JanLondon,ONTCANADA	
May 13 2005	Okay Stay	We stayed at the Four Queens one night and we were a little disappointed with our rooms. My sister and her husband had one room and it was not really that clean, alot of stains on the furniture, ours was a little better. Linens and bathrooms were clean. Very noisy as we had rooms overlooking Freemont Street. Good Casino, friendly staff. Be sure to ask for back rooms if you need your sleep!	
May 1 2005	Pleasantly surprised	My husband and I stayed at the Four Queens Tuesday, April 19. We decided we would change our flight if we could find a decent place to stay that was pretty cheap. After reading all the reviews on trip advisor I decided we would give the Four Queens a shot. I called and made the reservation getting a rate cheaper than was on the internet. It was $49 without tax. I requested a king, non smoking in what is supposed to be the nicer tower, ( I can't remember which one it is now). She said they couldn't guarantee that, but they would make the request. I told her the main thing was a non-smoking room. I also advised that our flight would not arrive until 10:00 pm, she made that note as well in case we had flight delays, they would not give our room away. Check in was easy, we got the room we requested (there is only 1 king bed on each floor is what I was told). We took our bags to the room. It was spotless. I was very pleased. We could tell the light show was going on, we could see the top of the canopy, but we hung out in the room for a while, before heading back out to grab a drink and watch the midnight show. It was great to walk out the doors and be on Freemont Street, it was the middle of the week so not very crowded. After the show, we grabbed a bite to eat at McDonalds which was next door and still open. Then went in and crashed, after all it was probably 3am my time. Slept great, the next morning we decided to see if our room at TI was ready, it would be by the time we got there, so we washed our face, brushed our teeth and waited until we got there to take a shower. We didn't use the shower so I don't know about drainage problems. Overall, I would definitely recommend Four Queens and I would stay there again although, I would not spend more than one night, but it was a great experience. We may actually start doing that, taking a late flight and staying downtown for the first night, it was fun!	
Apr 29 2005	Great Location In Downtown	It was an ok Hotel, Im thankful I got the room for about 60.00 a night. I would have been upset to pay some of their prices Ive seen them charging on the web.The hotel is in ok shape the rooms have alot to be desired...the beds were sunken and worn. Bedspreads have cigarette holes in them, Showers need caulking and a better scrubbing, toilet had a hard time flushing. Could hear noise every morning so we ended up having to get up about 7:30-8 every day. which is tough when you stayed up all night. We did not really like the atmosphere of the casino downstairs. That wasnt the hotels fault it was the type of people in the casino so we left and went next door to the Golden Nugget which had better atmosphere and seemed less seedy with nicer bars and a great buffet for 7.99. Our friends were staying in the Golden Nugget and I did see theyre room which was a much higher quality than ours. If you are going to stay at the Four Queens bring ear plugs to sleep with and youll be fine. but if you pay over 100 bucks you may be disappointed. Good Luck!	
Apr 11 2005	great price and great location!	The 4 of us stayed here friday &amp; saturday this past weekend. We had a blast. The four queens is located right in the middle of all of the action. Our room was average with the basics but we were only in there to sleep so it didnt matter. The cost of a cab from the four queens to circus circus was only $11.00 for the 4 of us (what a deal). If we would have taken the &quot;so called bus&quot;, it would have taken over an hour (due to all of the people that were waiting). Overall we had a great time and great location. I will definitely be staying at the four queens again.	
Apr 10 2005	Great place to Stay	Went to Vegas for vacation . Four Queens was great. Food was very good and reasonable. The rooms were very clean and the staff was very friendly an helpful.We will stay again soon.	
Apr 10 2005	Good Location-A Great Deal	We were guests of the Four Queens exactly 7 years ago today. Last minute change to plans-most hotels we wanted were sold out or WAY too expensive...thought we should give this a try. A LONG day of travelling (delays, bad turbulance, etc) and a late check in later, we arrived in our room to find it dirty. I was exausted...and stressed...and emotional...so dear hubby to be calls to front desk. They send someone up, and they upgrade us to a Fremont Street - facing suite. Decor outdated, sure. But it made my day. Casino nice enough-at the time I was all about the blackjack and I found a dealer who I LOVED. Funny, fast, knowledgeable...kept us all interested, laughing, and most importantly for the casino...at the table! I wish I could remember his name, but I do remember that my hubby kept borrowing money from me when he was down...and every time he would win a few hands, the dealer would stop, tell him to give me my &quot;loan&quot; back, and say &quot;No Money...No Honey.&quot; The Four Queens has its good and not so good points. But it is a decent value for those who go for the experience and the sightseeing...not to spend their money on a room alone. We've stayed there a few times, and we've stayed other places too. Would recommend and would go back again.	
Mar 30 2005	Better than I expected	Weekend of March 18, lots going on in Vegas and even a couple months early stuff the quality of Treasure Island or Stratosphere was 250, sometimes more. Hotwire had a 4 star (they always over &quot;star&quot;) for 85.00. Figured it was the nicer GOlden Nugget so I bit. Early check in was fine, nice young man and got my key. North tower is right off the casino, very convenient for gambling. Facing away from Fremont on the 8th floor wasn't very noisy at all. Clean room with all the basics, good housekeeping. Casino was okay, had the prime rib special in the restaurant and it was lame. Still, a far better experience than say the San Remo. No pool, but might not have used it any way.	
Mar 30 2005 	Four Queens Great Experience!	Really great price- around $30 per night. Upon request, you can stay on the top floor and get a great view of the desert. The food in the casino is not the best, we ate at the Chicago style pizza-- it was just ok. Their microbrewery is just ok as well, neither I nor my spouse were fans of their beers. For you money, go to the Fremont Casino's buffet across the street-- the best buffet we found at Vegas!The room was clean and the staff was relatively friendly (keep in mind that the staff in Las Vegas are somewhat jaded no matter where you stay!) Yes the rooms are a little noisy-- but that's only if you go to sleep before midnight! The only complaint I have is that the room service clean up is really slow. The same plates sat outside the hotel room for 4 nights! But you can't expect everything to be perfect at this price! Also, there is no pool, or transportation from the airport. But once again, what can you expect at this price??	
Mar 24 2005	Great Value for your money	3/16/05Clean and spacious.....probably the best value in Las Vegas. We have been to Vegas 11 times staying at all different places and this is the best for the money that you can get!There is no pool.....Our rooms were spotless and the beds were very comfortable. Towel sevice was great...maid service better than average. Dress was casual.	
Mar 13 2005	What a Joke	These idiots put me in a room on the 7th floor facing the freemont experiance. The music from Freemont St kept me up all night.	
Feb 24 2005	Four Queens ain't Four Stars but...	The title of this review may suggest that the Four Queens was inadequate but truthfully, I enjoyed my experience in Vegas...especially the Dowtown/Fremont area. If you have never been to Las Vegas (and before going with my girlfriend in August, we had never been either) you will undoubtedly be encouraged to stay on the Strip. That is for good reason. The Strip is as amazing as you have heard about and probably more...still, when we arrived we had no idea if staying Downtown was a good or bad thing. Instead of just simple narrative, I will break down the Four Queens, my trip and Vegas in general like this, LOCATION:We arrrived at the Four Queens on a Friday night and were immediately in wonder of the bright, vibrant lighting. The Four Queens is located in the heart of the Fremont Experience, adjacent to the Golden Nugget and Binion's Horseshoe. The Fremont Experience is a collection of gaming, restaurants, shopping and entertainment in Downtown Vegas, approx. two miles from the Strip. We had heard complaints about getting to and from the strip but honestly, the inexpensive bus ride is no more than ten minutes and most of that time is because of stops and rediculous traffic. No problem really. People will say that staying on the Strip is the thing to do but we didn't mind the back and forth travel. In fact many people we talked to on the Strip never made it Downtown, so we felt we got the best of both worlds. ACCOMODATIONS:The Four Queens is definitely &quot;old-school&quot; Vegas. We stayed in a standard room on a high level floor. The room was seemingly stuck in 70's decor but it was clean and not tiny. The ceiling in the shower had a tinge of rust, which I didn't care about but my girlfriend was not pleased. Our view was relatively bland, however, the mountains in the distance were beautiful. Because we spent very little actual time in the room, I can't tell you what room service is like. I can tell you the restaurant in the casino is good. And for that matter the casino itself was cool. (A lot of people we talked to at the tables and slots were staying at other hotels) Overall, I have nothing bad to say about the room, staff or casino. In fact, we when I broke down the price of the package, our nightly rate for hotel was approx. $16!! Can you really go wrong? And furthermore, what would you expect?WHAT ELSE:The Four Queens was nothing spectacular but it was not bad at all. When you visit the hotels on the Strip you will be blown away at the lavish designs and over-the-top construction. Beautiful giants such as the Bellaggio, Mandalay Bay and Ceasar's Palace are so plush, places like the Four Queens appear drab and pathetic. Still, because the location was downtown away from the madness of the Strip, the Four Queens is a reasonable, low-maintenance option for those who are the chill, low-maitenance type.	
Jan 30 2005	Thumbs down to the casino staff.	I did not stay in this hotel, but I did visit its casino on the night I ventured downtown. The whole experience left a bad taste in my mouth, and I will not return to the casino or the hotel again.A slot machine malfunctioned. I was attempting to press the &quot;select lines&quot; button on the screen, but the touchscreen was mis-aligned, and pressing the &quot;select lines&quot; button actually equated to a press of the &quot;Max Bet&quot; button -- something I most certainly didn't want to do. I immediately stopped and had a friend watch my machine while I attempted to located a slot attendant. Not seeing one, I asked the nearest employee - a security guard. &quot;Excuse me -- are there any slot attendants floating around here?&quot; He replied rather gruffly, &quot;I don't know.&quot; I, now peeved, replied, &quot;Do you work here?&quot; He replied, &quot;Yeah, but not in that department.&quot; Thanks, buddy.I walked to a different part of the casino and located a slot attendant. She walked over to the machine, I explained the problem, and then she pressed the &quot;select lines&quot; button -- the exact same thing happened -- another (unwanted) max bet (now I'm down two max bets on this machine that I was attempting to just play down a couple of credits and cash out with). After a minute, she called her supervisor over. The supervisor came over, but didn't understand what the problem was. She then insisted that I was playing the game wrong and that the machine in fact was not malfunctioning. I even explained that her co-worker had witnessed (and caused) the machine to again malfunction because of the faulty touchscreen -- she didn't understand (or care), and proceeded to press buttons and spin the reels. She finally assured me that I would get my credits back, but because of her lack of understanding the situation, she wound up short-paying me by six credits, despite the fact that I kept insisting the exact amount that I had.As I cashed out at the cage, I asked if there was a business card available for the casino manager. The cashier (the friendliest person I encountered the whole time) was very apologetic and asked if she could help me with anything. I explained the situation, and she said she'd call the slot manager over.The slot manager came over, I got partway through my explanation of what happened when the original supervisor came over. He stopped listening to me and asked her a few questions (to which she basically said, 'he had a problem with the machine and I paid him), asked me exactly what the problem was, to which I replied, &quot;Your machine malfunctioned -- the touchscreen is mis-aligned. She didn't understand or didn't care to understand what the problem was, told me I was playing the machine incorrectly, and then shorted me money paying me.&quot; Once he understood that I was shorted, he offered to pay me the six credits, but at that point I was so sick of the ordeal (and wanted to prove a point) that I told him to please keep the money and just fix the problems (the machine and the staffer). He told me he would, and I left....and that is why I will not visit the Four Queens again, and encourage other people to visit one of the many other fine hotels/casinos in Las Vegas.	
Jan 20 2005	Very Good!!	Just returned from a 5 night stay at the Four Queens..very qiuick and efficient. check-in...excellent room, although the bathroom was very small...had to close the door to get into the shower or bath....large room with a great view (1433)..housekeeping very good...excellent casino with all the new slots...food very good...the only problem I had was the bell desk...both times the guy didn't seem to want to get out of his chair to check or retrieve luggage or let me know where the airport shuttle would be picking up......grunted a little ..was sorry later that I had tipped him...	
Jan 18 2005	Awesome affordable whirlpool rooms	For someone looking for a reasonably priced hotel, try the 4 Queens in the downtown. We actually started in a standard room which was okay, but the second day, we upgraded to a deluxe whirlpool room, which overlooked the Fremont Street experience and had a city and mountain view. This room made the whole trip!!! Didn't think we would use the whirlpool much, but after a day of walking (everyday), it was a great way to relax before doing the night shows, gambling, and just people watching. The downtown casinos really all look alike, but the table game minimums are lower than on the strip and it is a much shorter walk to more casinos &amp; resturants.	
Jan 8 2005	Feel like a King at the Four Queens...	Just got back from a trip to Vegas...Stayed at the 4 Queens a couple nites and had a great time...everything you would expect from a hotel in downtown...clean, quite and safe...good food in the cafe...lots of slots to choose from...plenty of table games...great location...not much else to say except I can't wait to go back...	
Jan 7 2005	Four Queens very surprising but Great choice	I am a Travel Agent who went out on Jan 2-6 2005 just got back. And I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. First night coming in I had gotten the flu and spent most of the night in the room. It was clean and the bed comfortable to my surprise. On the next day went out for the day coming back realized our bath flooding and reported it to the front desk and also said that the room never been cleaned. We went to dinner and gambled some more came back to the room and found it in the same shape called down again and complained and got action right away. Maintaince came up and could not fix the bath and called down and had us moved to a Suite. It was great hugh room with a large bathroom and entry area. I had stayed at the Rio Suites 2 nights and the suite that we had at the Four Queens was larger and the bathroom was also larger. The fan in the bathroom was very noisy though. I was surprised they did make things better very quickly and we enjoyed the suite. Beside this mishap the rest of our stay was great.	
Jan 4 2005	The Rodeo was a Bonus	Spent 10 nights at the 4 queens downtown on Freemont street early December.We were very lucky as unknown to us the National Rodeo Finalswere in town , Lots of cowboys with their new weapons! ( mobile phones hung on their belts)There was free entertainment on Freemont street with acts from around the world from 6-12pm. The 4 queens was quite good but next time we will stay at the Golden Nugget, ( best Hotel Downtown!)	
Nov 23 2004	best in vegas but do not eat there!!!	I usually stayed at the golden nugget, but they were booked and would not make space even tho I had stayed there 2times per yr. for 15 years. With trepidation accepted accomodation at the four queens....casino and rooms better than the nugget, but the restarants are the pits..	
Sep 22 2004	Good time for cheap!	I was at the Four Queens for 5 nights during Bikefest 2004. The room was small but had all the necessary things.... TV, table and chairs, and a clean bed and bathroom. The furniture was fairly new and the room was bright and comfortable. The view was blocked by the Fremont Street canopy so basically there was no view, and the noise from the constant music and events happening on Fremont Street might be annoying to some, but I like the sounds of Vegas and it wasn't extemely loud so that didn't bother me. The casino itself is pretty small but nice. The restaurants were also very good. They include a cigar/microbrew lounge that I spent several nights in; a coffee shop that serves good food but the service could have been better, and a dressy restaurant called Hugo's that is more pricey, but still way below comparable restaurants on the south end of the strip, and the service and food were outstanding. All in all, I really enjoyed this hotel/casino. And at $39 a night it's a real bargain.	
Sep 21 2004	Las Vegas Experience	Just got back from three night stay at the 4 Queens in Las Vegas. Had booked 10 rooms, nonsmoking, king beds in January 2004 for September 2004. Pulled in around 6:00PM, checked in, three rooms not ready yet. Took about another hour for all the rooms to be cleaned. They sent me to my room, but it too had not been cleaned, even though the front desk had no idea it was dirty. Even when the room was clean there was mold in the shower. Three people did not get King beds but doubles. 7 out of 10 rooms were smoking rooms. This was our first time at the 4 Queens, last year we stayed at a different hotel, next year it is back to the hotel we were at before. I was disappointed in the fact that these rooms were booked so far in advance, just shows it didn't do me any good to book that far in advance.	
Sep 21 2004	Four Queens was a good choice	4 of us stayed at the Four Queens in Sept 2004. We'd been told we would be very disappointed. To our delight, we loved it! The staff were all very helpful and friendly, the casino was bright and fun. The room was nice sized (we had 2 queen sized beds) and included an iron and ironing board and a coffee maker. The carpet had seen better days but everything was clean. We'd definitely stay there again and it's right in the middle of the Fremont St experience.	
Sep 12 2004	where was the view?	Stayed at the Four Queens for three nights in August 2004.Where was my Vegas view! I was on the fourth floor with a view of a wall!Taxis to the Strip were expensive from here. You're saving on the room rate, but losing it on cab fares - $40 for a round-trip to Caesars Palace.	
Sep 5 2004	wonderful vacation	Me and my mom spent 4 nights at the 4 queens and it was great. Every morning they had brought a pack of coffee for morning coffee Hotel staff was very nice and helpful. The front desk suggested we take a taxi to saharahs and get the monorail when we were seeing david copperfield to save money good selection of casino games. The only thing we didnt like was the cocktail servers because they took forever and a day to come around room were very clean and we had fresh towels and the room cleaned no matter what time we left when we came back the room was shining. Many penny slots overall this visit was great of course never got to see the freemont experience from our room but only because we did not stay in the room long enough to see it as we came back every night around 3 or 5 lol lol but who comes to vegas to stay in your room????? I highly recommend 4 queens and next year when i go to vegas ill be there	
Sep 4 2004	Great Downtown Hotel	Great Hotel and Casino right in the middle of the Fremont Street Experience. I stayed August 30th and my room was clean and did not smell like smoke. The staff was friendly and waitresses came around often to give complimentary drinks. I stayed the night for only 22.50 and had a great experience. I suggest staying one night in the downtown casino before going to one of the strip hotels because you can experience the downtown in one night and the Freemont show is excellent. The only thing I can say that was was bad about the four queens is that it had no pool to go too but was still a great place to stay.	
Sep 1 2004	Not bad	I havent been to Vegas in 25 years, I can remember when you could drive down Freemont St. But the room was okay, the bathroom needed a remake, but it was okay. We were very safe due to the security asking for your room key everytime you get on the elevator. It was great ready to go back. Oh when I hit the Lottery.	
Aug 22 2004	VERY NICE BUT	My sister and I stay here every year for four days last time we were there they had taken out Burger King which was fast and able to take to room or get back gambling no one wants to wait 30 to 40 minutes to order we come to gamble we don&quot;t mind at dinner but lunch is another thing also you had the best Bread Pudding ever and the last time we had it was terrible with chocalate. Our guest asked if they dropped part of his fish because you cut down so much in the pieces,guess we were spoiled been coming there since the 50s.We never find fault with room service there great people.rooms are nice housekeeping is great.we will stay here every year anyway we have a lot of fun	
Aug 5 2004	Shake Rattle and Roll!	Enjoy loud noises? Like to feel your walls and floor vibrate? Then be sure to stay at the Four Queens. With rooms so close to the &quot;Fremont Street Experience&quot; you can almost touch it, you too can shake, rattle and roll on the hour from 8pm to 1am. Need more? Speakers pump out music 7/24 like a sixteen year old male home alone for the first time. I only made it through one of my two night reservation and to be fair there is another tower a few hundred feet father back from the street, but why chance it and have your weekend ruined?	
Jul 23 2004	Not A Bad Place To Stay	My wife &amp; I stayed at the Four Queens on July 18 &amp; 19, 2004. The Location is really great if you want to stay in the Freemont area which is a really cool area to stay. We have always stayed on the strip but next time we will once again stay in this area and probably at the Four Queens. The rooms are not &quot;Hilton&quot; rooms but they are clean and spacious. We were on the 16th floor and had no problem with noise as some people have described. We spent around $1,500 in the fremont area playing $1.00 slots and They are tight. We won around $300 total. We're used to winning a lot in Gulfport Mississippi so this was very disappointing.	
Jul 11 2004	Convenient locationa	We stayed at the Four Queens on July 2 on the last night of a western two week trip from Las Vegas to Utah and then back again. We had stayed on the strip when we flew into Las Vegas and wanted to experience Fremont Street on our night before our flight home. The room was older but more than adequate. We had read about the noise from the Fremont Experience so we requested and received a room on a higher floor (12th). Contrary to a previous review we DID NOT pay for parking. We were given a slip for the car when we checked in. We showed it to the parking attendant and no fee was required. We loved being able to walk around Fremont Street, go the room for a while to rest, and then back out for more fun.	
Jul 7 2004	You get what you pay for	4 queens is a cheap place to sleep. It's adequate for the price. But I am very dissappionted that I asked for a high floor,non smoking room with king size bed and got a stinky smoking room on the 3rd floor with 2 queen beds. That could be because we asked my father to go at the last minute and wanted ajoining rooms, which we didn't get, but they were across from each other. I also don't like to pay for parking in the hotel where we are staying. The little resturant had nice food, so much we shared a meal. It's nice to have the Fremont Street experience right out the door. You get what you pay for and since we go as cheap as we can we will probably stay at 4 queens again.	
Jul 2 2004	4 queens	My wife &amp; I spent four days at the 4 queens.The rooms were comfortable with a nice king size bed.the waitresses were friendly and fast.Overall it was a wonderful time.	
Jun 28 2004	We Love The Four Queens!	Large rooms,friendly security guards,easy on the pocketbook dining,gourmet dining,loose slots,great drinks,close to inexpensive Fremont Street shopping-(save money)...and a beer and pizza-type bar where the beer is mighty Fine-and the food tasty and fresh.The large bathrooms are a big Plus for the handicapped.Only 1 snag-Where are the Ice machines-they have them-but Where?From downtown Fremont, transportation is everywhere to All points (where the Pricier Places are) .We're going back!	
Jun 8 2004	save dollars	If you have too much money stay at the 5 star group but since I only sleep in my hotel I prefer to spend the $150.00 difference/night on food and entertainment. The above is clean and convenient.	
Apr 22 2004	Great friendly casino hosts dealers 	Wow! They treat you GREAT at the 4 Queens! Regardless if you are staying there or not. Every year my sisters and myself take our mother to Vagas for her Mother's Day present. 5 years ago we tried staying downtown for the 1st time and stayed at the Golden Nugget. The rooms were great but didn't enjoy gambling there. We found that we spent all of our awake time at the 4 Queens! The pit bosses and dealers were sooooo much fun! They all encouraged us to stay with them on our next trip and we have ever since. We are currently booked for June. It's like going home! They even remember our names and we get lots of hugs! Yes, our rooms are now complementary but we would gladly pay to stay there! The rates are very reasonable and the rooms are very nice and always clean! Yes, if your room is on the Fremont Steet side you can really hear the nightly entertainment but it stops at midnight and in Las Vegas who needs much sleep!! A special thanks to Marty, Executive Casino Host, and Cathy, one of the many wonderful Pit Bosses. Also, Cynthia, another Pit Boss, and Nick, Young, Connie, Royce and so many other friendly BJ dealers that make the 4 Queens experience so much fun! Highly recommend!! AAA in my book!	
Apr 18 2004	Great casino - lousy hotel	I have always enjoyed the gaming atmosphere in the Four Queens casino. You have great, friendsly, and knowledgable staff who knew how to keep the games flowing. The casino room itself is bright and cheery, and gave the impression that the hotel room themselves would be the same. Not so fast.I was given a room on the 4th floor of the north tower. When I got off the elevator after checking in at 3 pm, lying next to the ice machine were some dirty dishes, probably from room service. Not a good sign, but nothing to get excited over. Then you notice the paint job on the room doors were of dubious quality, and black marks on the hallway walls were all over the place, and there was a bad patch job of a hole in the wall of my room. When I came back to my room 12 hours later, the same dishes were still next to the ice machine. Obviously, no pride by the cleaning staff to get that taken care of.I will continue to gamble at the Four Queens, but I'll go elsewhere to sleep.	
Mar 30 2004	We like the Four Queens but its not the Ritz.	Not the ritz, but a good value. Our rooms were complimentary but even at normal price they are very reasonable. We have stayed at the Four Queens 3 times now, and like the location downtown. The casino has some good action; roulette and good nickle slots. The $7.99 prime rib in Magnolias is very good, and the food is served hot. During our last stay, the a/c wasn't working in our room, but I am sure we could have moved to another room, but chose not to. At the end of the stay, I wish we had, as it was warm at night. The rooms are clean with small bathroom but super water pressure made great showers. During our stay, only two elevators out of four were working properly, so I rode up, just to get a space in the elevator going down. This is unusual as all four were working for our other stays. Valet parking is free for hotel guests. You can watch Keno in the room for a change of pace; the live Keno is downstairs. Acrsoss the street is the Golden Nugget which has loose dollar slots. 1 block down to the Lady Luck, which can also be lucky. Where ever you play, be sure to get a players card to get comps. I'll give Four Queens 2 1/2 stars, but after all, in Vegas, how much time do you want spend in the room?	
Dec 17 2003	Just Got Back from Vegas...	Had a great time on Freemont Street. Nice place to stay.Didn't care for the rooms or staff at the Four Queens (rude and not helpful with directions or questions, and the rooms were kinda shabby). The cashiers were very nice... maybe they should work the front counter! Anyway, we will stay on Freemont Street next year, just a different hotel.	
Dec 11 2003	Thieves	I agree with the review titled &quot;Thieves&quot;, etc. I had a similar experience with a cashier. She gave me the wrong amount of money even though the money counter machine displayed the correct amount. When I confronted her, she said oh yeah and gave me the right money. I feel she was trying to cheat me and if I didn't catch the mistake, she would have pocketed my money. I spoke to the manager in charge and of course he defended her saying she couldn't have kept my money. The cashier's cage has cameras all around, etc. etc. As he walked away from me, I noticed he went over to her and said something. I have never never experienced that situation in a casino before.	
Nov 29 2003	Didn't actually stay there but loved Hugo's Cellar!	We were staying on the strip at the Aladdin, but we wanted to see the Fremont St. experience and have dinner downtown. First we went into the Fremont and were disappointed with the restaurants in there. Tony Roma's was advertising $10.99 for steak and lobster. They were a little busy and the hostess was rude. After we were seated we found out that the $10.99 special was not until after 10pm and the price at the time we were there would be $17.99. We wouldn't have minded that so much, but after the waitress told us we couldn't substitute a green salad for coleslaw, we realized we weren't paying for service at all there so we walked out. At that point we would have settled for Burger King because at least we would have had it our way! We went and asked our limo driver where a good place for steak and seafood was, she said if we were willing to pay a bit more, Hugo's Cellar in the 4 Queen's was definitely worth it. What a place! I was a bit skeptical until we approached the hostess and she immediately handed each of us a fresh rose to bring to our table. The wait staff was very attentive and dressed impeccably. There was more than one person waiting on us. The darker candlelight atmosphere was just what I like. The steak and lobster was so well worth the money we spent. Bring a big appetite because you get your money's worth not only with quality but with quantity. I only wish that I had enough room for the lovely deserts that they were offering. At the end of our meal we were given hot towels and a plate of chocolate covered strawberries, dates, and apricots. I left a big tip. It was totally worth it. You might need a reservation, but we were there on a Tuesday night at 8pm and we got right in.	
Nov 13 2003	bathroom could have been much cleaner!!!	The bathroom had dirty towels &amp; wash cloths in it when we arrived, called housekeeping and they were in no hurry to remidy the situation. Light bulbs were burnt out and you could not get one unscrewed and thew other the light bulb would not screw in. Also the bathroom had black mold in the corners of the shower, which with a little effort could have been cleaned. Mine at home isn't that way and I don't thindk when you are spending 80.00 a nite you should have to put up with that... Will never stay with you again......	
Nov 12 2003	The Four Queens a love and hate relationship	I stayed at the Four Queens in August on one of the lower level floors, no one told me the Freemont Experience sound was so loud it seemed that it went on for a couple of hours. The people next door to me were fighting and screaming everynight I complained that did find them another room which impressed me. On the room it was clean the bathroom a little small the casino was tight and crowded and the food court was not that great. Ask me if I would stay there again maybe??? on a higher floor to combat the noise for convenience it was great!!!!	
Oct 28 2003	Would definately stay here again	Stayed at the Four Queens 10-22-03 to 10-24-03 and would definately stay there again. Enjoyed the whole downtown experience. My room was very clean, the staff was very nice, and it was very conveniently located. The room was a little noisy, but who goes to Vegas to sleep?	
Oct 12 2003	great hotel for the money	our stay t the Four Queens was super. The hotel is a great value for the money . We had a room that faced Fremont Street and every morning we had breakfast delivered to our room and the service and food was exceptional The staff was friendly and efficient. The rooms were very clean ,we could not have asked for more . We will stay there again ,and we are downtown lovers , we always stay downtown. Try the Four Queens you will not be disappointed	
Sep 28 2003	Four Queens better than expected	The room was clean and comfortable and we really enjoyed the Fremont Street Experience. We got a special deal on the room thru Expedia and we were not disappointed.	
Aug 8 2003	Four Queens was a Lady!	We found the staff at the Four Queens to be most graceful and willing to help with any request. Our room was nothing special, but it was clean and comfortable. The housekeeping person apparently did not know the difference in shampoo and body lotion, after three days, we had three bottles of lotion, but no shampoo (fortunately, we had some of our own). We have always enjoyed the casino in the Four Queens, but this trip we did not spend much time there because the temperature (according to a display on the wall) was between 76 and 77 degrees F. This may be okay for many, but we found it uncomfortably warm. Will we go there again? Absolutely!!	
Jul 23 2003	Affordable Luxury	The Four Queens has nothing to offer other than its casino as far as ameneties go - not even a pool. However! walking through the hotel gives you a sense of pride, as if your staying at a 4 or 5 star hotel due to the shiny mirrors and bright lights that give the hotel a glitzy and glamorous feel. Just step outside the hotel and your right in the heart of the Freemont Experience where every night from 8-12 they have exciting and awesome laser light shows and there is plenty to do right on Fremont St. without having to drive to the strip (10 minutes by car) the room was nice and the bathroom included complimentary travel sized shampoo/conditioner. Not a big deal but again, considering the room rates, your lucky to get any. The hotel has free enclosed parking which should keep your car cool should you have one. Overall, it wasn't the greatest place to stay, but it provided what really matter most, a clean room and comfortable room at a fraction of what you would pay for anything comparable.	
Jul 15 2003	Fabulous Four Queens	I submitted this to Diane Chapman of the Four QueensI would like to start by saying Thank You. Thank you for a wonderful five day stay at the Four Queens! My husband and I miss the &quot;old&quot; Vegas and you provide the nostalgic atmosphere missing from all of the new &quot;sterile&quot; resorts and casinos.Your staff was cheerful, helpful and always pleasant; we intend to suggest your hotel to ALL of our associates. Our stay was made even more enjoyable by the generosity of your gaming facility! The refrigerator in our room was not cooling properly, we called and waited approx. 10 minutes, unbelievable, the response time was record breaking, your Engineer replaced the unit, all with a smile! We couldn't help but remark at how knowledgeable and informative all of your staff was, including your Security Department.Our room was clean and spacious; we enjoyed your instantaneous room service, on demand movies and the convenience of your taxi service. One thing absolutely stood out during our stay and this may sound strange, considering the climate during our visit BUT please commend your superb Chef on the delectable MINESTRONE soup, what a delightful &quot;elixir&quot;, such an unexpected taste treat.We have read reviews on your hotel rooms and were surprised by some suggesting that you try and stay as far from the Fremont St. experience as possible, because of the noise. We were on the ninth floor overlooking the Fremont and thoroughly enjoyed the nightly light show, honestly if you visit Las Vegas for a quiet nights sleep, something is wrong with you. We had the opportunity to enjoy a few fireworks on Thursday night; we could see them through our window, coming from the direction of the Stratosphere.We regretted having to leave on Monday morning BUT even upon our departure everyone we encountered was as gracious as when we checked in. The gentleman that retrieved our bags from our room was kind enough to unload our bags into our car in the Valet area and your Valet Attendant was also very pleasant. Please pass this along to your staff and their Superiors; everyone enjoys a well-deserved pat on the back, sincere praise, thanks, or a compliment. Well, we have decided that five days is just not enough to really enjoy Vegas, so we will just have to come back. Thank you, again Diane.	
Jun 11 2003	Theives	BJ Dealers are shysters.. they will try to underpay you. they will count out your chips wrong. belive me i spent a week and half downtown and that place must train their dealers. I understand they are in financial troubles so maybe thats it.. they get my thumbs down : (	
May 22 2003	Clean cheap rooms	The rooms are clean...But the walls &amp; door is very thin. Could hear people talking inside their room from the hallway...I didn't like that at all. But for a cheap, clean room...This is the place to stay.
