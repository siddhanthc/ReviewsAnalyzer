Nov 15 2009	Clean Cheap and Cheerful	This motel is popular with people from LA and so we saw some beautiful Harleys and Trucks. It is cheap and cheerful and the beds are the most comfortable I have ever had, we slept and after walking the Strip all day we were always glad to come back to rest. This is the good thing about this motel, it is off strip on Paradise Road. There is a shuttle that drops you off at Ballys but if he isnt busy one of the drivers will take you to Flamingo's. The only think that spoiled it was the breakfast, its cotly and greasy served by a surly male. But MacDonalds is 2 minutes up the road and so is a seven eleven where you buy cheap you water before going to town where it is three times the price.The pool is small but there is always room, there is a hot tub and a quiet area above the pool area to lie and catch the rays if its not tto hot 98 when we were there.There is a laundry room so buy your soap powder at the seven eleven as the dispenser is costly.The reception staff are helpful and always know whats going on. There is a little casino in reception and the bar is a great place to watch the football (American of course)Because of the size of the rooms I would recommend this place for families as there is two queen size beds and room for cots.Also leaflets for take aways were always in the door making eating cheap after seeing the prices at the strip we ate either at Downtowns (The original strip) or got take away.I liked it because I found the need for peace and quiet after a dat at the strip as the noise becomes a pain, Vegas never closes.	
Oct 14 2009 	Best stay for Vegas	Great hotel, close to the monorail which brings you to 'the carnival' within 5 minutes. If you book a hotel at the strip you'll have to take a cab to get to the other side of the strip. Monorail has tickets for 1, 3 or 7 days. You can on and off as much as you like.Hotel has always plenty of parking space and it's free, a fridge in the room and a bar which is open for 24 hours!If I go again I go for this one again	
Oct 11 2009 	very relaxed	Very good value for money a good base for the strip found the rooms to be clean and towels changed every day nice pool area slot laundry very handy plus dryer no complaints at all staff very helpful	
Sep 22 2009 	Great location (1 Mile from the Strip)	A small hotel in &quot;Vegas terms&quot; but perfectly adequate for visiting the sites.A good clean pool to chill out and spacious well cleaned rooms.This hotel is always busy so it speaks for itself.OK if you want all the trimings go stay on the strip but you will pay for it big style !	
Sep 18 2009 	Stuck in the 60s. Skip it and stay elsewhere in Las Vegas.	Remember those drive-up motels your parents used to take you to on vacation as a kid? Well this is one of those from the 1960s only it's since been eclipsed by the high-rise hotels and convetion centre that have been built around it.I booked this after reading the reviews on Tripadvisor and I have to say I was fairly disappointed. It really is an old property badly in need of renovation, and some of the staff are extremely surly. On the upside it is walking distance to the convention centre and the monorail (which will take you to the strip). Don't rely on the hotel shuttle to the strip unless you want to get fried by the heat. It's an old broken down van with no air conditioning and hot air blowing through the back.The rooms and pool area are kept failry clean but it is made up of a long maze of stairs and outdoor hallways so if you have a lot of luggage you will be doing some lifting and hiking back and forth.The lobby is smokey and filled with very strange characters playing the slot machines. Now this might just be a vegas thing, but they seemed stranger than in some other parts of town. We had breakfast included with our stay (normally $10 per person) and I had no complaints about the food. Good usual hot breakfast fare.Even if you're on a budget I'd skip this hotel, try Hotwire or Priceline to get somewhere nicer at a cheap rate, or splurge and go for a nicer property. Honestly I think Best Western is going downhill. They own some really old properties and don't seem interested in fixing them up, they just keep them running as is.	
Sep 11 2009 	Close to Conv Center	The Best Western Mardi Gras is a decent hotel and I like it since it's really close to the convention center. I've stayed here at least 5 times over the years and have had no problems. It's the closest &quot;budget&quot; hotel near the Convention Center. Also, since it's much smaller than a mega-casino you can quickly get in and out of your room and out to a cab. The rooms are quite large and have a free fridge that you can actually put stuff in unlike at the Wynn. The food at the coffee shop is fine and the mini-casino is fun. As Arnold would say: &quot;I'll be back&quot;.	
Sep 5 2009 	Stolen	I traveled with my co workers... we were put in this hotel by the boss... 3 of us in seperate rooms had our digital cameras stolen! I also had my wallet stolen, luckly i had my money and ID on me. DO not stay here.. you will get your stuff stolen!!!!!!	
Aug 6 2009 	Terrible And FILTHY!!	I had reserved this hotel well in advance and was going to stay for 3 nights. I was traveling with my kids and mom and wanted something off the strip to be calmer and Best Western is a name I know and trust. The room was filthy, bathroom smelled like pee and there was hair in the refrigerator. I made the mistake of moving the night stand over to plug in my phone and found a condom!!I did not stay there again and after complaing to the front desk all they did was offer us breakfast(which was supoosed to be free anyways.)Do NOT EVER STAY HERE!!	
Jul 26 2009 	Clean and comfortable great sleep.	We stayed at this hotel for 4 days and the Luxor for 3 days. We had a more enjoyable sleep here then at the Luxor. No long line ups and a short trip to your room. The room was dated but very clean and comfortable. We were pleased to see a refrigerator and a coffee machine, which is great for families. There were a few shady people in the slot machine area but we did not have to walk through this on a daily basis. The bar area was too smokey to enjoy any meals but we did not stay here for the facilities. Although my kids did enjoy swimming in the pool. Overall it served its purpose and we would stay here again if we were passing through.	
Jul 8 2009 	Very Stingy with Towels and Toilet Tissue! Mini-Fridge doesn't get cold!	This place would be nice if the housekeeping staff was allowed to give you enough towels. There are enough when you check in, but the next morning they take away your used towels and don't have enough to re-stock the room. This is a very large hotel, even when they are very slow (less than 25% full according to the desk clerk), they don't have clean washcloths to put in your room -- even early in the morning. The room check person will come around after your room is clean. You tell this person you don't have wash cloths, hand towels, or toilet tissue paper and she says someone will bring some right away... Three hours later, we asked her and she didn't remember.. she carries that radio but never called for anyone to bring stuff to our room. We went to the front desk and they told us that we need to get that stuff from housekeeping and that it will be put in our room. We had to raid an unattended housekeeping cart just to get the minimal stuff we could get by with...The mini-fridge in our room on this stay barely ran, even on it's highest setting, and didn't get can drinks cold enough... we had to haul ice from the first floor to the third floor about three times each day.The chain lock for the door was broken, there was nothing on the end of it to hook into the slot on the door.We called 5 times during our stay about the door lock and the fridge. We were told that the fridge would be replaced &quot;right away&quot; and the door lock would be fixed &quot;right away&quot;. Neither of these were fixed.The hot tub doesn't work.The pool area is opened and closed at different times each day.Today, the pool opened after nine even though they told us it opens at 8.The &quot;high speed&quot; internet is extremely slow!!! It's not much better than dial-up access. :(This place really sucks.	
Jul 8 2009 	Nice affordable accomodation!	My wife &amp; I spent 7 nights at this motel. It reminded my wife a little of Butlins back in the 70's however do not take this as a negative. The rooms are extremely spacious with 2 double beds (extremely comfy) bathroom and kitchen area as well as TV with good choice of channels. Air conditioning was loud but essential as it was 100oF outside! The pool was small but perfectly formed and more than adequate for the number of users-loungers and pool towels were provided free of charge.The 'casino' consists of a couple of dozen fruit machines and is a bit on the small side. Free Internet for 15mins a time was just perfect to check on e-mails etc....The bar was great, with 4 TV screens showing different sporting events &amp; a good choice of reasonably priced drinks (my wife and I had 'sex on the beach' each night costing just $7 each! they were cocktails by the way!). The menu did not have a fantastic choice however we tried a number of things during our stay all of which were lovely especially the rack of ribs which I had on our last night.The location of this motel is not great however the strip is accessible by free hourly shuttle bus provided by Mardi Gras and the Monorail which is a five minute walk away, has 7 stops along the strip and costs $28 dollars for a 3 day ticket which is advisable to save your legs! A taxi costs about $10 each way.Taxi from airport is approx $10-$15 and is by far the best way to transfer to this motel.All in all we had a highly enjoyable stay at this motel and would suggest it as a good place to stay for a friendly, homely atmosphere away from the hustle and bustle!	
Jul 7 2009 	Good Hotel Very Unfriendly Staff	The hotel was nice, close to the strip without the crowd. The staff on the front desk were very rude and unfriendly, each time I had to deal with them. Guest services were uncompetent, had to call several times for items because they never arrived. We had two adults and two teenagers in the room, but only 2 towels in the room, no hand towels and two washclothes. Maid service was terrible, they did an awful job of cleaning the room, did not clean the coffee pot or leave new supplies, had to call for supplies that took forever to get to us. Again only left two washcloths and still no hand towels. I usually have very good luck with the Best Western hotels, but this one was a big disappointment.	
Jul 7 2009 	great	just returned after a 14 day holiday hotel.it was worth the money . nice and clean. staff nice and helpful a free shuttle to and from the strip with a great russian driver who went out of his way to help you very enjoyable holiday. breakfast was basic towards the others but good a little bit pricey though. the bar and restrant was the only negitive point of the holiday the male staff was very ignorant and was slow to serve us for food. food was nice when we did get served .would go back again.	
Jul 3 2009 	FANTASTIC PLACE - ONE OF THE BEST!	It has made my blood boil reading some of the reviews on this hotel, jeez, what do some people expect from a budget hotel, the Ritz! This is THE friendliest hotel I have ever stayed in, nothing was too much trouble, unlike some of the bigger hotels that we visited on The Strip.We were two ladies (aged 48 and 60) travelling alone and never once did we feel unsafe at this hotel, the rooms were clean with a double bed each and I have to say, that we both agreed that they were the most comfortable hotel beds we had ever slept in! The pool area was clean and had ample sun beds.As an example, my friend and myself wanted somewhere to go and dance and listen to some decent music (i.e. not rap, r&amp;b or hip hop), the owner Philippe spent about an hour on his mobile phone phoning just about every hotel on the strip trying to find us somewhere to go (unfortunately there wasn't anywhere!), try to get that service from the owner of the Bellagio!After an exhausting night on The Strip, it was nice to come back to the bar and have a friendly evening with the bar staff, it felt like coming home after a night out.Don't let these reviews put you off staying at this hotel, yes it's off the strip, but we used the monorail regularly and also the shuttle bus from the hotel. A taxi only cost between £10-£15 dollars too.Thank you Philippe and all your staff for a wonderful stay!	
Jul 2 2009 	Excellent stay	I've just landed back from a week in Vegas where we stayed at the Mardi Gras...had a very enjoyable stay.The staff are friendly (although reception is normally manned by 1 person so can take time for you to to be seen) and food was very nice. Jerry, Jason and William provided us with an excellent, friendly service!Location wasnt great but the shuttle took you to strip between 8am-11pm and the mono rail is $13 dollars per day which is handy.The only thing I'd say which is a negative is about the surrounding area is slightly dodgy so just make sure if you miss the shuttle at night, you pay around $4 for a taxi as it's worth it.Room was clean and cleaned for us daily, they have a handy man who cleans the pool each day and although the pool was a wee bit on the cold side, it was a blessing in the 100 degrees plus heat!Would recommend to all that are looking for a budget hotel, don't have too many aires and graces and are prepared to stay around a mile off the strip	
Jun 30 2009 	Disappointing at best	Where do I start? First, the hotel is in a poor location, meaning that you'd rather not stand outside more than necessary. Some of the other guests gave me the creeps as well. They said they were running a &quot;free breakfast&quot; promotion, but they only gave us two vouchers per room (we had two rooms) and there were five in our party. Extra people were $10, they said, so we just ate cold cereal in our rooms. Continuing...the rooms didn't feel &quot;level&quot; (like a ball placed on the floor might roll off on its own), the AC and fridge were off when we got there, and their &quot;energy saving&quot; system where you have to leave your room key in a slot in the wall was a royal pain. Worst of all, our room was on the 3rd floor and the only elevator (which was completely on the other side of the property) felt like a death trap. It was about 110 degrees in there (at 9pm), and the floor numbers didn't light up as we ascended, so we seriously started to worry if we were going to die of heat exhaustion before we got there. We ended up hauling the rest of our luggage up the stairs.	
Jun 28 2009 	A VERY FRIENDLY HOTEL THAT GIVES GREAT VALUE FOR MONEY	This was our first trip to vegas and like many others was a bit aprehensive after reading some of the other reviews.HOW WRONG THEY ARE. This is a great value for money hotel.The rooms are clean,tidy and spacious and all the staff are very friendly.(especially JERRY who works the bar and was so nice to us and JASON don't sit at his tables until he seats you...he goes nuts.but is a great bloke.) We travelled with family who had 2 small kids and nothing was a problem. The pool is freezing but once you get in out of the sun it's a blessing.We got married on the Monday and went back to the hotel later with family for drinks and looked after by all the staff very well.The only down side is the location to the strip,(monorail is $5 each per trip no matter how many stops),free bus to the strip is great. but only stops at Bally's and goes once an hour.Menu fine for evening meals but not enough choice for a light lunch.All in all a very enjoyable trip.Thanks to you all at the hotel.	
Jun 20 2009 	Basic but good value	After six trips to Las vegas this was the first one we stayed at several years ago. We got a good deal in April so went back for another week. Apart from the first trip all the hotels we have stayed at have been on the strip whereas this one is not. It is a small motel style hotel just off the strip with a shuttle bus every hour to one of the strip hotels. This is good and if the bus is filled the driver will return. It is also handy for the new monorail but this is extremely expensive and should be avoided until they see sense and drop the price. The hotel has good largew clean rooms with fridge and kitchen worktops. A small casino and an excellent swimming pool with sun loungers. The bar is cosy and the food first class. Turn left out of the door and it is a short walk to the excellent Encore and Wynne hotels and then onwards up the strip. Getting around is easy on foot or using the excellent and cheap 'The Deuce' double deckers. All in all Las Vegas is brilliant and the Mardi Gras is a great place to start.	
Jun 18 2009 	Excellent Value for Money!!!!	Well what can I say about my Stay in the Mardi Gras Best Western?To start with I was a little apprehensive about the visiting having read some of the reviews on this site. However after my visit between 3rd June &amp; 17th of June I kind of wonder what the majority on here were looking for?Best Western cater for the &quot;lower end&quot; of the market and are the equivalent to a travel lodge/holiday inn type thing in the UK.The hotel was located just off the strip about a mile out and cost between $8 - $12 in a taxi depending where you were going travelling from. The hotel also run a free shuttle bus on the hour that will drop you off at Bally's and from there you have a short walk 100m to the main strip were you can head either left or right and take your pick of many of the attractions ths strip has to offer - remember and tip the driver a few bucks I seen so many people get the bus daily and not give the driver a few bucks for the service. Anyway back to the hotel, it was clean - maid service daily although they never got nto our room often as we were out every night and not returning til around 6/7am so sleeping at the times the maids were on duty.The bar area although small was superbly stocked and the staff were absolutely class big praise to Chris, Kelly, Jerrie and Cheryl. The food on offer again for what you paid was really good. I think I tried most of the chicken dishes - all very good and the $1.49 breakfast is a must have when you hit the hotel in the wee small hours. The rooms again were basic but they had 2 beds, shower/bath sink and shaving area and we had a fridge as well as tea/coffee making facilities. Also had free wi-fi access in the room which was great.The pool area was very quiet nice sized pool for the number of users and there was also plenty of beds, the hot tub was class too. There was a garden area and also a sun lounge area which was on the 1st floor. My only criticism of the pool area was there is no bar or waiter service so if you wanted a drink you had to leave the area and then come back - bit of a pain that one. I realise this review is a bit all over the place, I am not long back only been back in Glasgow a few hours but wanted to get this done as soon as i could as i felt some of the reviews were very harsh.	
May 9 2009 	Clean and basic	Parents stayed here for two weeks with Thomas Cook, clean and basic, pool area nice with padded cushions, shade if you want it. Small bar and restaurant, bar service excellent by Jason. Good value snacks after 11pm. Small slot machine area. Payouts in cash not tickets. Shuttle bus service once per hour, but not guarenteed to be on time.The two male drivers were excellent more or less on time, the female driver was unreliable with an attitude problem, always leaving the Best Western late, and considering there is only one shuttle an hour this is unacceptable and inconvienient to all guests. Many Thomas Cook guests complained about the female driver being late including my parents. She thought it was her own bus and not interested in providing a scheduled shuttle service, thus Thomas Cook guests did not tip her, but tipped the guys who provided a good service. Drops off at the side of Ballys Casino on Flamingo. MacDonalds ideal for breakfast one block away. Visited the Desert Rose and the Gold Coast while we were there for future reference, would stay there instead of the Mardi Gras.	
May 9 2009 	not a good quality hotel	service was awful. rooms were not very nice. surrounding area do not feel safe. had to ask for extra pillow four times, each time was told it was on its way. very small bar , and the slot machine did not appear to be very entertaining , barely got a run. slot machine area very small and could not get a seat at the small bar any time. not a good stay	
Apr 26 2009 	Convention Center Bargain Suite Hotel	I have stayed at this hotel annually due to its 10-minute walk proximity to the Convention Center. See my past reviews every April. Once again, I had a great stay. The Good Stuff: If you get a 1-bed room, you will have a living room with couch (2-bed rooms put 2nd bed there). Room has frig, and large in-room safe. I usually can get an early check-in. Parking is free. Nice outdoor pool. And I always am given a $20 OFF Next Stay coupon when I leave, which they allow me to use even though it is usually expired a year later at my next visit. There are also numerous restaurants just a few blocks to the south. The Bad Stuff: There is no free Continental Breakfast - the breakfast buffet costs $8.95, but is full breakfast hot table. (I usually just buy a bag of donuts a Speedee Mart a block south and use the in-room coffee maker.) No free Internet PC in the lobby, but there is free wireless Internet in the rooms, and a Kinkos a few blocks south that has PC's. Within the past few months they have stopped their shuttle to and from the airport (Booo!), but they still run an hourly shuttle to the Strip. (Airport is only $15 cab ride.) I booked the room 4 months early on the BW.com chain site, but you should also check the hotel's own MGI.com site. The rate varied night to night, but the average was $65. With tax it was $75, then minus my $20 OFF coupon it was $70/night with all taxes and fees. If you are attending a convention and can't get a room here, check the hotels on Convention Center Drive. I would recommend this hotel to anyone attending a convention, but it is not near the Strip.	
Apr 24 2009 	excellent value for money-much better than being on the strip!	Having stayed in vegas on the strip before, we were nervous to be away from the nightlife. However, we were more than pleased with this hotel and it's friendly cosy atmoshpere and returning to it at night was a relief after the hustle and bustle of the strip. some nights we preferred to stay in the hotel which offers lovely food at all hours and excellent bar service from mark, jerry, cheryl, jason and chris. Mel the shuttle bus driver was very accommodating and gave us useful tips about vegas. we felt part of the family! the room was pleasant enough and always cleaned if you got up early enough and we just loved the pool. overall a very good honeymoon and we can't wait to go back to mardi gras again next year-just hope the same staff are there!!	
Mar 24 2009 	Needs TLC but clean	We stayed on way home from N.Z Rooms need spit n polish but clean Hubby was pickpocked on Strip and staff here were Stars could not have been more helpful more than can be said for staff at Mirage were it happened they would not let me use free number to report card theft and charged $14 for internet Safe deposit boxes in room pool and sun terrace quiet and clean Shuttle to and from the Strip hourly 8am-11pm If you are looking for clean cheap hotel with good location this is it Take note major road works due to extend Paradise road over 18mnths-2yrs not started yet but soon so check before you book!!	
Feb 28 2009 	Horrible Rooms Horrible Service	I stayed at this hotel for a convention that I was attending at the convention center. The rooms were horrible to say the least. It looks like the hotel has not be renovated since it was opened, which was probably about 30 years ago.I moved rooms 3 times before I found a room that was reasonble in terms of cleaniness and comfort. I was travelling alone, so I put up with a lot of nasty things, I would never take my wife and kids here.	
Jan 25 2009	good enough	The front desk lady at the Best Western A Wayfarer's Inn and Suites in Kingman booked us in here for a very favourable rate. The lobby is in the casino so is smoky and noisy. However our nonsmoking room was fine. Unlike other BW's at which we have stayed, there is no free breakfast here, too bad. We stayed on the ground floor facing the parking lot; the room was quiet. The wifi worked fine. There is a nice pool in the enclosed courtyard but only the spa was heated when we visited in January. You could suntan by the pool or on the large raised sundeck in warmer months.There is a complimentary shuttle to the Strip, but to only one stop (Bally's), so no matter where you go from there, you have to return there if you want a shuttle ride back.	
Jan 21 2009 	Great place	Great place to stay. No real complaints. About 15-20 minute walk to the Strip. Good internet conection, Good breakfast. Didn't gamble in the casino but it seemed okay. For those who won't drive, but fly into Las Vegas they no longer pick-up or drop off people at the airport. Also they have a hotel van but will only drop people off at Bally's, no budging for anywhere else.	
Jan 8 2009 	We were robbed!	We have stayed at Best Western hotel from Dec 16 to 21. On Dec 16, thieves broke into our car and took our video equipments worth $4000. They have tried to break the lock and take the car first. At last they finally broke the glass and took our cloths and video equipments. There is no necessary security available in the hotel. We have heard similar stories from other people who have stayed in the same hotel. On the second day, we woke up in the midnight after hearing some guys talking aloud outside. We were scared. They have left after some time.We have decided to leave the next day, and they said they wont refund the amount. Since we have booked our room through hotels.com, it was a mess talking to both of them to find a solution. None of them helped. Finally we have decided to stay back in case if we can get our stuff back. The hotel gave us some voucher for food and moved to a room close to the office.Unless the hotel increases the security, there is no safety. Even the thieves can take your car away.	
Jan 7 2009 	Fantastic fortnight at the Mardi Gras	First of all I should mention that this review is based on a holiday I took almost three years ago now. The holiday was meant as a cheap getaway with a mate, just to relax for a fortnight and enjoy all the pleasures LV had to offer (note to other half, we didn't take in all the pleasures!). The deal we found was unbeatable for the money - 2 weeks for £500pp. I would have liked to have stayed in the Bellagio or one of the other luxury complexes, but as I said the deal was too good to beat. If you're expecting Bellagio refinement, you'll be disappointed, but if you're a proper traveller looking for a comfortable and affordable stay, then the Best Western is it.The Best Western Mardi Gras is located on Paradise, the main road that runs parallel to the strip. It's approx a 15/20 min walk for a young fit person to the crossroad at Wynn, Treasure Island and the big shopping mall shaped like a flying saucer. Alternatively you can catch a monorail shuttle from the LV Convention Centre which is a 5 minute walk along Paradise Road towards the Renaissance and Hilton hotels. I can't recommend enough buying the 3 day unlimited travel card for the monorail at a cost of $21 ('06 price). It will save you so much money in the long run, especially if you're considering taking taxi's. The gates are patrolled during the day by security but quite often at night are unattended, so single travellers and females might feel a little uncomfortable walking across the convention centre car park at night, back to the hotel. Please don't let this put you off, rather be cautious. Also, if someone approaches you while you're buying a ticket from the machines, offering to let you through the barriers for the 3 dollars it would usually cost for a one way ticket, be warned that if security catch you, you'll be in as much trouble as the 'tout'. Just so you know, the Convention Centre stop for the monorail also has a free wifi suite, so you can go and hook up while you have a coffee. The coffee costs however ;-)Anyway, back to the hotel! It's worth remembering that the hotel offers a shuttle to the strip and airport at regular times (check with the front desk). It was free, although the rather butch lady driver did expect a tip from time to time (what American tourism's built on!!). She did give me some good advice while traveling with her though, if a woman comes up to you wearing clear i.e. transparant heals on her shoes, she most probably is a sex worker. Got me out a heap of trouble that one ;-)The lobby of the hotel houses the 'Casino' which in reality is a few rows of fruit machines. I think you sometimes get non patrons coming in to play, some Mexican, there is a poor neighbourhood a few blocks away so be security minded when playing the machines and keep hold of belongings.On the subject of security, the rooms in the hotel each have a safe, but you need to pay the front desk a deposit for the safe key. Rather frustratingly the first few nights they didn't have any spare keys and when they did finally have one, it didn't work!! Eventually though I managed to get hold of one. Very advisable to store your valuables in one as I said above there are some poor neighbourhoods near-ish.The rooms are incredibly spacious and we were lucky enough to have a sort of kitchen area with fridge and sink and kettle. It would have been really handy if we had a microwave too, but it was still handy to have. If you're staying for more than a week and are on a bit of a budget, this next bit will save you a bundle of cash. There's a local supermarket a few blocks away near a large mall. Go left out of the hotel and down Paradise until you reach a gas station and then head left. I think it's called Vons and it's part of Safeway. You have to walk through a few neighbourhoods that we were advised to stay away from by the local Police (while we're talking of Police, don't try to hail a Taxi like you see in the films, it's not allowed in LV and especially frowned upon when said Taxi turns out to be a Police car), but during day time I never saw a soul walking around there. I would advise however to not walk around this area from 3pm onwards, when the schools are out or at dusk. The mall is worth paying a visit too as it has a lot of shops not featured on the strip and also more competitive prices.If you sign up and pay for a clubcard type scheme at the supermarket, you'll be eligible for all the discounts, multibuys ect. We stocked up on cereal, banana's milk, yoghurt's, bread and water (which is very expensive in the hotel) so we could have cheap snacks in our room. Be warned that it's at least a 20/30 minute walk and if you buy a lot of stuff you will need to call a Taxi, which you can do from the front desk at the super market. Be sure that when you put the stuff in the boot or trunk, of the Taxi, he doesn't attempt to drive off when you get out. Be warned that some taxi drivers will try to sell you 'VIP' passes to some of the nightclubs. These are not VIP and will not let you gain entry for free. The drivers will expect you to pay for these tickets.The maids are all Mexican and extremely poor. Some speak English and some don't. We had a lovely lady come in to do our rooms and she did an excellent job. Everyday I left a dollar bill on the pillow for her and at the end of the week she thanked me so much I almost had a little cry. A dollar will mean so much to them and it shows that you care - 75p folks, that's all it costs. And remember they're on less than the legal minimum wage.The pool area is smallish and if you had a few families in it, would be too noisy and cramped, but pick the right time of day and it's really pleasant. Mid day is SCORCHING, so fair skin should cover up. If you get too hot then pop down to the bar for an Orange juice. There's also an ice machine next to the doors into the lobby/casino which can be handy.We were booked into the hotel on room only basis so I can't comment on what the breakfasts were like. We did however have dinner in the restaurant/bar one evening which was ok, although I'm a vegetarian and found the choice very limited (everywhere was limited, not just here). I think I lived on SubWay for a good portion of the time.Would I go back? Yes, absolutely. Unless the hotel has gone down since I last stayed, I would say that it's a fantastic base because it's away from the crowds, but not too far away. It's location is far enough back from the strip to give you a break from all of that. The local transport links are great and not overly expensive either. There's a lot to see and do in LV, don't forget Freemont or the Grand Canyon/Hoover Dam. Just for reference, avoid taking a flight over the Canyon, take a proper tour where you actually get to go on the canyon floor.If you do decide to stay, be nice to the Mexican ladies!!!	
Jan 2 2009 	Great holiday	Bit dubious about the hotel before we arrived as we had been told that the American's called it the 'Mardi Grot'!!! Arrived on Christmas Eve and the rooms were very clean and comfortable. The bar was great. Very friendly staff who go out of their way to help. Our room was cleaned each day, including Xmas Day and clean towels were left each time. The food however, wasn't fantastic. We had no problems at all with this hotel. The Monorail was a 5 minute walk away from the hotel and for 12 dollars per day you could travel on it as much as you liked. It runs until 3am. There was a courtesy shuttle bus operated by the hotel to take you to the strip and back hourly. So easy to get around. We had a few drinks in the bar late at night after a busy day out and there was a great atmosphere. I wouldn't think twice about staying there again and I wouldn't stay just anywhere. I would recommend it to anyone who likes the smaller, friendlier and more personal hotel. We stayed in Aladdin last time, now Planet Hollywood. Eventhough this hotel is not a patch on Planet Hollywood, it was much friendlier. Absolutely fab holiday.	
Jan 2 2009 	Clean and comfortable	When we read reviews about this hotel we were very worried, but when we got there we were pleasantly surprised, the rooms were large and recently redecorated, the beds were clean and very comfortable, with the added bonus of fridge and coffee maker, It was very close to the monorail which got us to the strip quickly and cheaply, if you didn't want to do that there was a free courtesy bus every hour to and from Bally's, There was a small bar which we retired most evenings which had good beer and the best vodka and coke which we needed after a hectic day on the strip, Food wasn't brilliant just ok but the staff were helpful and friendly. there is a small casino with only bandits but a welcome change, form the noisy large casino's, We would stay there again .,	
Nov 24 2008 	Basic Very basic... Not the best	As a travel agent i had a good rate to stay in the MgM grand booked 10 months in advance, booked for my friends wedding, there was 25 of us and most of them stayed in between the excalibur and mgm, I unfortunatly lost my job and the hotel when Xl leisure group went bust, therefore i did not have a large budget to re book anything else, still a travel agent got a decent rate at the best western but without looking up reviews as i am far from picky but you get what you pay for here,I visited my other friends regularly through out my trip and our hotel comprared to theirs was very upsetting considering i was originaly staying there and paid out alot of money to do so, the decor at best western was awful. small bathrooms, dodgy locals or guests (whichever) !! wondering around when we got in quiet late, wouldnt have felt safe here without my partner. hit or miss with the staff found them to ber quite helpfull actualy, ok breakfast some days bit grose some days ok, didnt use the pool looked very small and enclosed, ok location even thou off the stirp easy accessible due to free courtesy bus and monorail less than 5 mins walk away.. Bar small smokey and very dull food not all that great again, we ate here once, didnt spend much time at hotel avoided it as much as possible and used it to just get some sleep, next tine would definatly pay more and stay some where else but due to the circumstances of my situation i had no choice but to stay here..

Nov 10 2008 	Loved the Ribs	We met our family from Australia at the Mardi Gras and what a great time we had. We have no complaints at all. If you dont like Posh then this is the place to go. Very clean and very friendly staff who couldnt be more helpful.And close enough to the strip. Mono Rail just a few minutes walk from the hotel. Plenty of taxis and not expensive to use. Looking forward to our next visit and staying at the Mardi Gras again. And the breakfast was good. as much as you can eat for $8 95. If you have a evening meal there try the ribs.Wonderful. Thankyou	
Oct 31 2008 	Nice place to stay	My friend and I were given a corner room in the back of the motel and it was nice and quiet. The only disturbance was the housekeeping crew on the first morning. We were close to the laundry area and could hear a little of the goings on. Not much though. The room was nice and clean and the half wall between the beds gave us some semi-privacy. We left a tip for the housekeeper in the morning and when we came back that evening it was still there showing how honest they are. We would definitly stay here again. The pool area was clean and the spa was a nice retreat for weary muscles in the evening.	
Oct 27 2008 	Okay for the price	Hotel is off the strip and not somewhere I would walk around at night. Rooms are very spacious mini suites, though the furniture is dated and could use an upgrade. Staff is average, learning more towards a bit surly. Casino is very small with only a few tables. Usually only of which 1 or 2 is open. Trying to get a cab is near impossible, so only stay here if you have a car and know your way around. I would only stay here again if I really couldn't find elsewhere and the price was right. A lot more negatives than positives. Pool area looked a bit grimey and did not venture over there. though they do have a nice sun deck area to lay out on.	
Sep 29 2008 	great for the money	my wife and i spent 2 weeks here in sept 08 ,and after reading some of the reviews we were a little worried about this hotel,but the place was fine,its not a 5 star but your not paying 5 star money. the rooms are quite big and ours had 2 queen size beds inside. the pool area is small by vegas size but we never had any problems getting a sun bed and the hot tub is hot. there is a free shuttle bus that runs you to the strip from 8am until 11pm just give the driver a $1. the rooms were cleaned every day and fresh towels whenever you wanted them. the location is a 20 min walk to the strip and there was no problem on a night time. i have no negative things to say about this hotel and i would certinley go back. as four vegas the place never sleeps and there is allways something to do. there are far to many shows to mention but there is something for everyone.	
Sep 9 2008 	A good stay.	Very nice hotel.The frontdesk was helpfull, the restaurant served good food morning, evening and dinner, the rooms where very clean and very big with big refrigerator. Nice beds, A/C worked well, and you need that in LV, cause its always hot!The pool was a good size, temperature nice cool, a waitress can serve you cold drinks at pool side, good prices on food/beverages.Located just off the strip its perfect. 10$ max for a taxi to LV Downtown.We will stay here again for sure.	
Sep 9 2008 	Clean Comfortable No complaints at all!!	We stayed in the Best Western in July 2008. Our room was large with two double beds which were extremely comfortable. The AC worked fine but a bit noisy. Had a few noisy neighbours the first few nights but with the aid of ear plugs we both got a good night's sleep. The cleaners were brilliant. We had fresh towels every day and the room was always left spotless with replacement soap and shampoo plus shower caps every other day. We also went to LA for a few days but we informed the staff and our room was cleaned but left secure for the 3 days we were away.The shuttle service is fab but as others have said it gets busy at peak times - they would actually need a bigger bus as getting in and out of the back seats takes some manoeurving!!. The bus drivers , Kyle and Bob were friendly and courteous.This is a great budget hotel which is close to the convention centre for the monorail. Would recommend using the bus system as its cheaper and runs every 10 mins.As before breakfast after 9.30am is a losing battle. We just went to the bar for breakfast but the hotel was extremely busy so we had quite a wait but it didnt really bother us as we were on wind down to go home anyway.	
Sep 7 2008 	Very good value for the price	OK, so the Mardis Gras isn't your top of the range hotel with spa, wave pool etc - however it does not come with a top of the range price tag so what do you expect!We stayed there for 10 nights, and I couldn't really fault the place - rooms were clean and comfortable and of good size with a fridge, and were serviced every day. The pool was reasonable size, clean and was not too crowded like you find in some of the bigger hotel complexes.Although the hotel is off the strip, there is a monorail station within 5 minutes walk of the hotel - this serves the whole of the strip from MGM grand all the way the the stratosphere with 6 stops on the route from 7am to 2am (3am Friday-Sunday). A taxi from MGM Grand to the hotel is only about $7 too so getting around isn't really that expensive.The hotel also has a complementary shuttle service too/from the airport.If all you want is somewhere clean to sleep with the availability of a pool if you want it, then I highly recommend the Mardis Gras.	
Aug 18 2008	Decent Option	I did a last minute trip to Vegas, and most rooms were either sold out or very expensive. I found this hotel from Kayak for about $65/night. The room was actually quite large, and it was clean. The AC didn't work very well, but they got it fixed after the first night. The wireless internet wasn't working well at all during my stay. It was easy in and easy out, but definitely a trek from everything. If you just need a room and don't care about location, this is an OK option.	
Aug 18 2008 	Quiet cheap 	We've been staying there 4 nights, when starting &amp; returning from our 21 days Western trip.The motel is quiet compared to many other ones (and that are generally more expensive) where your hear everything, from your neightbour's shower to the people coming back and talking out loud in front of your door. Rooms are huge &amp; beds are comfy but would need some renovations deco wise. The pool is always nice after a long day walking on the Strip. The fridge &amp; the tea/coffee set are a plus. Breakfast not included.I would say a nice place to stay in Vegas, not far from the Strip or Downtown, especially if you don't want to spend 200$ per night! On top of it, it is always nice to escape from the busy Vegas and get some rest at night.	
Jul 31 2008	Wouldn't really bother try somewhere else first	The hotel rooms were ok and kept clean but looking very old and tired and the door had to be kicked open to get in. The whole place could do with a makeover. The pool is a good size and warm, but that may because of the time of year we went.It also has a good shuttle service that takes you to the strip which we used a few times. That gets packed at peak times so the driver has to make multiple trips.That's about it with the ok things and yes I know its not the Hilton but theres really nothing else good to say about the place, terrible if you have kids with you. The bar is connected to the resturant and they get annoyed if you sit down just for a drink. We were asked how long we would be sitting there and got moved down a table. You can't go anywhere else because most of the lobby area is filled with slot machines and kids can't go in there.The staff are not very friendly most of waiters seem tired and are a bit short with you, probably as most of them can be spotted at the slot machines gambling their tips all night.The biggest problem we had was we went to Los Angeles for a couple of nights and came back to an open door, probably the maid had left it open. I don't know how long for but I would highly recommend using the room safe.Food not that great and expensive. If you go for breakfast after about 9.30 the buffet will have run out of food and the waiters are not too keen to restock.Wouldn't really recommend the place.	
Jul 20 2008	I have pity for the front desk staff	I have stayed there approx 6 times over the last 10-12 years.The rooms have aged a bit but it happens. I did find the night shift clerk or the &quot;Night Auditor&quot; a bit surly but I under stand as I was a Night Auditor for over 10 yearsmy self. My real simpathies are with the evening desk staff. The hotel has Karaoke in the lounge that is right next to the lobby and no wall between them. If they can stillfunction with all that off key wailing they have my respect.	
Jul 18 2008 	Comfortable quiet	While certainly not the Bellagio or Caesar's Palace, the Mardi Gras was comfortable, quiet, clean, and inexpensive. There was a minor problem with the telephone, but the staff addressed it quickly. Lobby/casino was smoky but that appears to be a general hazard in Las Vegas outside the top tier hotels. Our non-smoking room was fine, with good beds and a good shower (always an important feature). We found the location convenient, and the staff helpful.	
Jul 10 2008 	Viva Las Vegas	After reading some of these reviews about the Mardi Gras you really CAN'T please everyone! Just back after a fortnight staying at the Mardi Gras and I certainly can't fault it one bit. Seven of us went away and not one complaint. We all had a fantastic time and will certainly be back that's for sure!! Rooms clean and tidy worth the money, food great even though we're sick of looking at burgers now ha. Staff were great very pleasant and helpful. Plenty to do and see. The worse part of the holiday is actually dragging yourself away to come home!!!	
Jun 9 2008 	its not the grand but we loved it	i would like to say how we was concerned at the reviews we read about this hotel. We found it was clean the food was good the staff was fantastic the rooms tidy cleaned daily. also the bar was very cheap the service was good . the hotel has 300 rooms so you meet people, not like the big hotels on the strip where there are thousands we stayed on strip but found this hotel more relaxed. the pool area is good. i would recommend this hotel highly we are both retired we loved our stay at the mardi gras.

May 25 2008 	Dingy looking Hotel	We had booked 14 days in another hotel casino very close to the Mardi Gras but the travel representative informed us we had to stay at the Best Western Mardi Gras, This hotel/casino is a tired looking motel type property, with a small bar/cafe area and 40 old fashioned slots in a arcade area, the rooms are dingy and very noisy and lack privacy and security being on an external walkway with access straight from the car park. This hotel need lots of money spent on it to bring it up to date. The staff are friendly enough. I will not be staying at the Mardi Gras again even though I will be holidaying in Vegas again.	
May 16 2008 	Convetion Center hotel on a budget	We had 3 days at the National Hardware Show on 5th, 6th &amp; 7th of May. We checked in on Monday the 5th and check in was smooth and pleasant experience staff extremely helpful and professional. Lobby is part of small slot based casino and bar. We were given a top floor room on the front of building room 3101. I would not advise anyone to take this room in the future until it has been refurbished the nicotine coated walls &amp; ceilings gave the room a pungent &amp; fusty smokey smell I don't think the room is a smoking one anymore but the years of nicotine were clearly evident, bathroom was very clean but basic. The room had no sound proofing from the 6 lane motorway which is only about 20ft away you can also see daylight through the room door the curtain only just covers the single glazed windows. If you have a sleep mask and ear plugs you may get some sleep.The main reason we booked this hotel was to get us close to the convention centre and what an excellant location 2mins walk away. I would recommend the Holiday Inn on Polaris Avenue its a lot further away but a far superior hotel.	
Apr 25 2008 	Pretty good experience	The motel has really large rooms with either a living room and bed or two beds. I recommend asking for an inside room. The area is ok, but after dark it gets a bit sketchy. The tram is within walking distance, but there were a few times we felt unsafe after we got off. The hotel has a free shuttle that operates till 11pm. Only issue is that it gets full fast and then you have to sit around waiting for another one.(we waited a half hour and ended up taking a cab) Shuttle takes you to and from Ballys. I recommend taking a cab over the tram because the cab is the same price. Pool area was nice, pool was clean. I felt comfortable in the motel and it was clean and maintained with a fridge in the room. The casino is very very small, but fun if you just want to play a few coins. They have a free computer you can use. The restaurant is inexpensive, and we enjoyed the food. One comment- from the site we were under the impression it was close to the strip. Define close. We love walking, and I would not recommend walking to the strip. It's far and probably not so safe... but good value at the price we paid via CAA.	
Apr 21 2008	Be Warned	Hadn't been to Vegas in over a decade and was driving into town calling around for an available room. Picked this hotel out of a AAA book and called. Told them we had 2 kids and wanted a good pool and walking distance to the strip. &quot;We have a great pool and we're right off the strip&quot; was the answer, so we reserved a room. A good start, but from there it went down hill fast.1. Pool was freezing cold. I saw lots of people attempt, but only one person make it it and she packed a good deal of insulation. Jacuzzi was heated, but not working. Turns out pool does not have a heating system. (Kid's were very disappointed). But, at least their's the strip...2. Turns out Hotel is 1/2 mile from the strip. Not right off the strip or walking distance in my book. They have a shuttle, but it runs only once an hour (not very convenient). Got conflicting advice from hotel staff about ability to park near the strip at other hotels. (At this point Dad is getting peeved).3. Room has binder listing the various activities on the strip. We browsed it and picked out a few to check out. Luckily my wife called ahead to get better directions and found that they were no longer active attractions. One was closed for winter and not due to open until May (it was April), the other has closed over 6 months ago for remodel. Worthless binder of misinformation.4. They serve a breakfast buffet, but unlike almost all Best Westerns it's not included in the price and costs $9 a head. Not worth it for what it was.5. Iron leaked, toilet couldn't handle it, light bulb was out, sheets felt to be full synthetic (scratchy).6. Hotel is old and need of a complete remodel. The only good point about it is the larger than normal room size. We had non smoking room, but smokers around us were abundant and you could not avoid it.About the only good point I could say was the larger than normal room size.After discovering all this I complained, but was repeatedly told there was no manager on premise and no way to call one. They said call back at certain time, we did and still no manager. This is a rather large hotel and no manager on site ever (sounds like a run-around to me).I finally got &quot;a&quot; call when I wasn't available and they left a voice message. I called back, still no manager available. I finally got another call back from an assistant who offered to credit my card $40 dollars. I took them up on it as I figured I never hook up with someone who was really interested in hearing my complaints.	
Apr 10 2008 	one of the better places i have been in	As other have said i to read some reviews how mistaken we found the accomodation to be spacious and cleaned daily if clean towels were needed then all we had to do was leave the dirty on the floor complimentory toiletries were left daily and the maid was only to pleased to give more if asked for. There is a free shuttle that leaves on the hour that goes first to BALLEYS hotel then to the airport. Only had two problems one being that the pool was freezing and another was that we had to give up $100 as a deposit for the room returned on departure which the travel agent did not tell us on booking the safe in the room only costs $2 a day very reasonable bar stays open 24 hours as do most places in vegas the mono rail is just a few meters up the road right of the main entrance its the conference centre stop we bought 24 hour passes $9 each you can ride up and down as often as you like we stayed in 2931 very nice room second floor bottom end of the complex two places highly recommended to eat one being TERRIBLES about a 15-20 min walk left of the main entrance $4.99 buffet breakfast and if you pick up a leaflet in the hotel you can buy one get one free with it. The other place if you want good food is the buffet in HARRAHS hotel $23.00 more food than you can shake a stick at def recommend the CANYON tour and do the SKYWALK.We are def going back next year as there are still some hotels we have not seen esp in the downtown area all i can say is GO SEE AND ENJOY	
Apr 4 2008	Don't stay at the Mardi Gras. We found BED BUGS in our beds!!	My husband, daughter, son-in-law, infant grandson, and I went to Las Vegas in Feb. 2008 and stayed at the Mardi Gras Hotel and Casino. We had booked this through hotels.com, so we had never been there. Upon sight, the room looked nice and clean, but the second night, our daughter woke up, feeling something crawling on her. We found a small &quot;tick looking&quot; critter and put it in a bottle. The next night , the same thing happened. This one was larger than the first. We captured it also, and took the first one to the hotel desk, told the desk clerks what had happened and left it with them.We brought the second one home and the next day I took it to the State Home Extension Office, where an entomologist examined it under a microscope and told me it was a bed bug and that it was quite large because it had just had a &quot;blood meal&quot; . It had feasted on our daughter!! She gave me the phone number of the Public Health Dept. in East Las Vegas and told me to report it to them, which I did. They said they would send someone out to examine the room and would call me back. It's April and I still haven't received a call from them.I have Googled &quot;bed bugs in Las Vegas&quot; and was amazed at the list of hotels that have been reported to have bed bugs. The report started with the Stratisphere and went on and on. I don't think I am ever staying in Las Vegas again. The entomologist said, &quot;Well, I guess what happens in Vegas, doesn't stay in Vegas, does it?&quot; NO, it certainly DOES NOT&quot;! You can back bed bugs home with you! We had to wash and re-wash everything we had taken with us, but you have to wait 50 days to see if you packed them home with you!!I recommend anyone planning a trip to Vegas check the &quot;bed bug list&quot; and see if your hotel is on it.P.S. Two years ago I contracted Norwalk Virus in Vegas, too!! Be careful what you eat.	
Mar 21 2008	Don`t stop here	Where do you start about this hotel?.This is our third visit to Las Vegas,and due to our usual hotel been fully booked our agent put us in this hotel which should be renamed the &quot;Worst&quot; Best Western We were booked in here for five nights,they offer a pick up service from the airport,we phoned them but they didn`t pick us up. The safe in the room didn`t work when asked what they could do about this,the answer was nothing. The room was dirty and smelly,and the outside and inside apperance of the whole place was run down. It states in the advert that it is near the Strip and Monorail,this is true if you like a Long walk. Due to the state of the place and their attitude towards us we only stayed there about an hour,then checked out and went to stay in another hotel on the Strip.Remember the movie Psycho do I say more???.The best thing for this hotel would be to demolish it.	
Mar 21 2008 	friendly and great vaue	having read reviews of this hotel, arrived with some trepidation. However fears were unfounded, the Ballagio it is not, but it was clean, friendly and great value for money. Hotel shuttle worked very well for the strip and airport (remember to tip driver!) this was our fourth stay in Vegas and will be our fifth next year	
Feb 11 2008 	Stay at your own risk!!	Booked in here to be within walking distance of the Convention Center....Big Mistake!! This place is dilapidated to the enth degree.It's not that close to the Convention Center and being a rookie I didn't realize free shuttles run from every conceivable hotel in Vegas to the Convention Center.The Mardi Gras is very run down and nasty. There is no casino there are a few slot machines but that is it. Evidently the owner or owners are sitting on some valuable real estate and not putting anything at all back into the facility. As I was checking in there were multiple calls to the front desk about no hot water. When I checked out a couple in front of me complained about no hot water for two days and it was offered to comp their $10 breakfast.Not a nice place but have to say the employees were very friendly and helpful but there wasn't much they could offer to make the place cleaner or better maintained. One day the manager came scurrying out from the office behind the front desk, gave the clerk on duty a through chewing out in a loud voice then scurried back in his hole.	
Feb 10 2008 	You probably DO NOT want to stay here unless you are broke.	Reading some of the favorable reviews here, I must simply declare that I could find no evidence of their truth, and so I question their veracity. I trusted them to my detriment.It's a scary place -- the door locks are shaky, and it's a typical old-style motel, with the door opening into the parking lot or a concrete platform leading to stairs, and the platform rocks and sways when a laundry cart rolls by or more than a few people walk together.The oddest thing happened my first night there: The bathroom fan and light, typically on a timer to save energy, were wired in reverse, so they came back on after 15 minutes. All night long. At first it had seemed I'd failed to turn off the light, but after three trips in an hour, I could not imagine why this was occurring and finally figured it out, which didn't solve the problem but somewhat eased my mind. I simply closed the bathroom door and ignored the noise and the light emanating from the room.Look, this place is not terrible, and nothing bad happened to me, and perhaps you could do worse. But I doubt you really want to stay here, though I confess your finances might make you need to stay here.As for me, I chose it because I over-relied on the reviews filled with false praise, and because the city was largely booked when I need a room. Never again.	
Jan 20 2008 	Geat Place New Renovations	The Mardi Gras Hotel is next to the Convention Center in Las Vegas off the strip. The check in was fast and friendly, the young lady gave me early check in and said there was no problem in getting my airline boarding pass when I was departing. I stayed 3 nights and the room was perfect. They have completed new renovations, new tile in bathroom, completely new bathroom, small refrigerator in kitchen and coffee maker. Two great beds with firm mattress, great sleeping. Heating system works automatically when you put your room key in a slot by the door.They have a shuttle service that runs to the airport and one that goes to the strip on the hour. Very nice if you don't have a car.I had a car and did not use the service. They have a little casino and a restaurant. I did not visit either place. All things considered I will spend a few nights there on my next trip to Vegas.	
Nov 21 2007 	Decent priced value sub-average location if ur here for the strip	I always enjoy Best Western.Great room, huge, and well furnished, great quality bedding, I slept like a baby. A little loud at night on the weekends, with the people coming in at all hours from the casinos and such, but hey, that's Vegas for u.Customer service was friendly, and knowledgeable, pool was beautiful, my room looked right down at it, though I didn't actually get in. The room I was in was set up realy cool, it had two beds, and between them, there was a lil semi-wall decorative thing, that gave us some privacy in each bed. It was my date and I, and another couple, so it worked out well, as we each had privacy in our beds, and yet, could talk to each other as if the wall wasn't there, cuz it wasn't really a wall, it didn't go all the way to the ceiling..the kitchenette was great too, with a lil wet bar and stuff, it was awesome!!Great place for Vegas visitors!Very near to the Hilton Las Vegas, and the convention center, though a bit away from the strip, not quite walking distance, in my opinion.. but hey, if ur gonna be drinking or anything, stay here, take a cab, it's worth it!	
Nov 18 2007 	Not so good...	Rooms are huge and clean but location is not so good and this hotel is very expensive!!!Warning : Several rooms contains wireless unit which make a lot of noise all the day and night!!!	
Nov 12 2007 	Great value for price.	We booked this hotel for a one night in Vegas just because we knew we weren't going to stay inside our room for long. We chose it of course because comparing to the prices of other hotels for just a Saturday night, this one was quite affordable. To our suprise, the room was impeccable, very nicely furnished and very clean. Despite the outside look of the building and that it was a budget hotel, they had very comfortable beds, very nice pillows, modern and new decorations, nice clean kitchenette with coffee pot and free coffee, small but modern bathroom, etc. A small detail which is common in most expensive hotels: the blanket in the bed was covered by a white clean sheet. The only thing that we didn't like was the breakfast on premises which was rather expensive and not very good. I think this is a great budget hotel that gives you a lot more for your money that most motels out there. Highly recommend it.	
Nov 11 2007 	Filthy carpeting in room	The room that we stayed in was in need of new linens. Bed spread was old and dirty looking and one of the pillow cases had an imprint of a shoe on it. Carpeting was so dirty that I would not walk bare foot in the room. I stood on a towel while getting dressed as I felt so uncomfortable with the filthy carpet. Ice bucket was filthy also. I feel at the very least a room should be clean and ours wasn't. I don't think that a customer should have to start cleaning a room when they arrive. I have to admit that the van drivers were decent and the front desk people were helpful but this hotel is in need of some serious cleaning. I don't think they believe in wash cloths as we never received one in the week that we stayed at the hotel. I would have rather spent another $10 per night and stayed at a clean hotel. We woke each morning to blue laundry carts wheeling past our room. The laundry area is at the end of the hotel past the rooms. We mentioned this issue to house keeping and they informed us that they were working on the problem.	
Sep 24 2007 	It's not the Mandalay but thats not a bad thing Great alternative	My wife and I stayed here for two weeks. As everyone says, bigger than average rooms, clean and comfortable. Big bed, couch, fridge, TV (TV channels weren't great but you would have to be mad to watch TV in Vegas, right). Pool area was clean and tidy, free towels for guests. Bar and resteraunt were OK, better places could be found but for a quiet alternative then the food was good and plenty of choice at the bar. Mc D's is a two minute walk away if thats your bag. The strip is fantastic no question but for two weeks holiday this was ideal for us. A little quieter, being on the strip for two weeks would have been too full on. Being on the strip with a car would have been a nightmare as well, constantly jammed. The monorail is a few minutes walk away or you can take the free hotel bus to the Bally. Basically you can take it or leave the strip as your mood takes you. All in all we would go back. If you want the bright lights 24/7 then hit the strip, if not this place might just be perfect for you.	
Sep 17 2007	Worth to stay	My wife and I we arrived at the hotel on late afternoon from Switzerland. Enven though we were disappointed that our airlines (Delta) forgot our luggages in Atlanta....the hotel gave us a very nice and big room (two king size beds). The room was clean and cozy.The hotel is not so far away from the &quot;Strip&quot; (10 min. walk). The swimming pool is also nice.If you plan to stay some days, you can choose this hotel without problem and the price is quite affordable.	
Sep 5 2007 	they don't call it "best" for nothing	We called for a pick up at the Airport as soon as we landed and it was there in 10 minutes! Checked in 1 hour early with no problems, took maybe 5 minutes.Had dinner on site and it was good and we had the breakfast buffett everyday at $8.50. Easy walk to Monorail. Check out was a breeze, we checked out at 11:00 and they held our bags for us as we once again went to the strip, we came back at 2:00p.m., pick up our bags, the shuttle took us to the airport, and this was AFTER we had already checked out! Great staff, nice rooms, highly recommend!	
Sep 2 2007	Great Staff real taste of Vegas	This is the third time we have stayed at this hotel. It's the staff who really make the stay special. The rooms are more like small appartments, could do with a lick of paint, but adequate. It gives you the true taste of Vegas, away from the lights of the &quot;rip off&quot; Strip. Here you pay local prices for your drinks in a small but frindly atmosphere. The food in the restaurant bar is good and reasonally priced. The hotel has a curtsey shuttle bus that runs from the hotel to the Strip every hour, don't fortget to tip the driver,as they will also take you to most places, between the runs to the strip/airpot, for a fraction of the price of a taxi.Yes it isn't the glitz and glamour of the Strip but a true taste of Vegas and the locals. Staff that remember your name, which you rarely get in one of the larger hotels on the Strip.We have made a lot of friends from comming to this hotel, and now know people who we go back to see every year, making it a base to travel around the rest of States.If this is your firt time to Vegas, yes do the Strip, and Downtown, if you want to play poker go to the Tuscany Suites and Casino, on Flamingo, for a small stake you to can play in a small and friendly atmophere. Shoot a machine gun at the Gun Shop and best of all rent a Harley or just visit the largest Harley store in the world, you can get a free shuttle from Baliys side entrance, also a free shuttle to the Rio from here. My final tip for the more adventurous, nip accross the road from Baliys drop off point, there is a small Iron workers Bar, called the Stage door, this is the real Vegas!!	
Aug 31 2007 	Great hotel Great location Great memories	This was my 1st visit to Las Vegas. And will not be the last.I rushed into booking my Air tours (My travel) Virgin amongst others also provide accommodation at this hotel holiday at the Best Western Mardi Gras Hotel and casino which I later regretted due to some reviews that I saw on the internet.How stupid I was thinking this.The hotel is great for the money; in a nut shell all you do in a hotel room is sleep and wash.The service in all departments was greatFast check inOur room was ready early 13:00The room was big and clean, The advertised mini bar is 2 bottles of water (if required)We required a roll out bed for the teenager in our party it was in the room within 10 minutes of requesting. And there was no charge.We had a problem with our in room air con unit maintenance was there within 10 minutes and when we got back after a day out a brand new replacement was in place.All though the size of the casino is like a mouse hole compared to the big hotels this was not a problem to me (I am not a casino addict) every where you look in Vegas has a casino (if they could fit them into the toilets they would)ProsAll staff was friendly and nothing was a problemLarge room,Comfortable bedsFree coffee and maker,Fridge,Cheap in room safe $2 per day (£1 approx),No hassle getting to your room (like the big hotels) this hotel has only 3 floors and 300 rooms approx,Less traffic than on the strip.Free mini bus to the strip on the hour. Also a service to the airportVery ideal location if you have a car, with easy on site parking.Drinks not too expensive in the bar free soft drink top ups with a meal.Free local phone calls from in room. (See below for a great phone card deal)ConsNONE REALY BUTDo not expect the Ritz, but as stated above I had no problem the comfort/cleanliness and the service was there what more do you want?Stated as 1.5 miles from the strip again not a real problem as a free mini bus is provided. Or use the mono rail.Other Valuable informationGot a great phone card deal the my travel phone card $15 (£7.50 approx) gave me over 200 minuets to UK land lines via a toll free number.Food is a plenty in Vegas. Started off with the Buffet at Circus Circus equivalent to about £7 per adult for evening meal incl soft drinks thought great not bad value until we found Arizona Charlies hotel and casino on the Boulder Highway 4 miles from the Mardi Gras a much better quality and Value at £4.50 per adult approx special days it was £6 when rib steak or steak and shrimp was an added choice but still astounding value.Want to go on the helicopter over the Grand Canyon book early these fill up quick. This was an unforgettable experience.Are you a thrill seeker go on the Stratosphere tower top rides the Xscream ride that puts you facing down to the ground was the most terrifying experience and thrill of my life.Got a child not a problem plenty for them to see and do the lights and entertainment (free shows and attraction at the hotels in air conditioned comfort.Blackpool in not a patch on Vegas. Kids can walk through the casinos but not loiter or watch.We went in August and saw Temperatures high as 117 degrees.Shopping  go to Wal-Mart They have plenty super centres around the area.(not on the strip though.There are also 2 outlet centres one either end of the strip. Do not miss The Freemont street experience this free spectacular is a must with the world largest LCD screen in the roof. This is every night. There are regular busses every few minutes.Also look out for the free shows put on by the hotels like the fountains or loins (MGM Grand) etc.Some hotels on the strip are linked together with either walk ways or even free tram/monorail linksA great holiday I would recommend.	
Aug 29 2007 	Best Western Mardi Gras Las Vegas - bigger ripoff than casinos	Booked a stay for two nights at this hotel and then needed to cancel the second night. Deadline for cancelling was 4:00 pm on Wednesday before. I called the 800 number at 3:45 and after waiting a few minutes, I spoke with someone who after a few more minutes told me I had to cancel directly with the hotel. I called them (no toll free number available) and after a few minutes was told that I had to cancel through the 800 number because it was booked over the internet. Well, you get the drift. I called the 800 number and then was referred back to the hotel and by then it was after 4:00 and they would not cancel. I talked to a manager at check-in and he refused as well. As an aside, we booked a king sized bed but wound up in the very back of the hotel (noisy area0 with two queen beds. Room was not the cleanest but it was acceptable. We left the next day and when I tried to check out from the road I was hit with higher charges for the room. It seems they add extra $ on Saturday night. When I complained, the person (Cori) hung up on me. I'm still working with my credit card company to get a refund of the excess charges and/or unused night. Not holding my breath but Best Western will NEVER get my business again - I'll sleep in my car before staying with them!	
Aug 15 2007 	Great Time for our 20th Anniversary	My wife and I celebrated our 20th Anniversary in Las Vegas. We chose this hotel because of the relatively quiet location away from the Las Vegas Strip. The room was large and comfortable. The safe did not work, but it was replaced very quickly. The staff was very friendly and helpful, especially the cleaning staff. Overall, it was well worth the money. There were only two drawbacks. The first was, each time we asked for toiletry items we were charged. We weren't aware of the charges until check-out. Also, we ordered pizza from the hotel restaurant late one night. We were told one price over the telephone, but when it was delivered, the price nearly doubled with gratituties, delivery charges, etc. I would recommend this hotel, but don't ask for personal hygiene products or a late night pizza delivery.	
Aug 7 2007 	Not even for one night!!	We only stayed in the Mardi Gras overnight twice - en route to Page AZ &amp; back again. That was more than enough! The check-in was late &amp; disorganised - rooms not ready. The rooms were grubby &amp; scruffy to say the least, the air conditioning barely worked &amp; was noisy I wonder what the rooms were like before they were ready on the nights we stayed? The bar &amp; restaurant looked as if it doubled as the local bail hostel - not a relaxing place to be!! Even two nights with nearly two weeks in between was too many nights to spend here - definately not a place for the faint hearted who want to sleep in clean rooms. We will never go back - ever!!	
Jun 30 2007	Cheap place to stay away from the strip	We booked the hotel for one night because we wanted to save a few bucks and be able to easily drive to and from the hotel.The room was much larger than expected with a eating counter and refrigerator, but no microwave. Television didn't work, but the staff quickly sent someone up to take care of the problem.Breakfast buffet was overpriced ($8.95) for want you got and the food of poor quality. We also attempted to order a pizza but were told they only offer it after 11pm at night and we didn't want to want that long. Overall, I wouldn't recommend eating here.The strip is three long blocks away and the monorail station a block away.Nothing at the hotel had a New Orleans atmosphere other than the name.Overall, a good place to stay if you want to save money and don't mind being a long walk from the strip.	
Jun 15 2007	a bit quiet for myself	As hotels go the mardi gras was a nice clean and comfortable hotel-type motel.but when you are in the best city in the world for hotels...it makes you wonder....was just too far from the strip, we would get the shuttle in the morning then miss it coming back...not to good.if you want to go to vegas and take a back seat then this could be the one..	
Jun 6 2007 	Good hotel bad service	We booked two rooms over memorial weekend. Rooms are very spacious and ok clean. Hotel is a great hotel when it comes to a tourist class hotel. You might want to gamble and eat somewhere else...The only issue I had was the house keeping. When we returned from a long day at around 5:30 our room was not made up. I called and complained and they send up the maid. I was in the shower and I told the maid that I need 20 minutes to finish my shower and get out of the room. Of course you might guess it was going home time and the maid never returned ... ever. At night there was no maid service available. Ok I agree this sometimes happens ..but what really made me upset is the fact that I brought this to the attention of the manager on duty the next morning after I already have checked out. I did not wanted to have any freebee however he basically told me that it was my fault because I refused service. Of course he was partially right because for 20 minutes I was in a shower. I guess instead of blaming me a simple sorry would have gone a long way.	
May 31 2007 	nice basic hotel	Just got back from staying at this hotel and had no problems, Check in took no time and we were in our room before 3pm, staff were friendly and helpful, rooms were basic but were cleaned daily, The pool area was nice, pool was clean, The restauraunt food was lovely and quite cheap, and it wasn't too smokey at all as you can only smoke at the bar and the 'casino' is across the other side so this causes no problems, as for transport, we used the free shutttle to take us to the strip which took 2mins and we would get a taxi back, and the location is fine as it is quieter han the strip, i would stay again.	
May 26 2007 	Decent Hotel but Awful Checkin	I was a little dubious about this hotel based on other reviews. I will start by saying that those who complained about the long wait for check-in were absolutely spot-on! Quite simply, the worst check-in experience I have had at any hotel, anywhere in the world, ever. They absolutely will not let you check-in until 3PM, by which time a very long line has developed. Rooms are allocated at check-in from those that are clean and available - do not expect to get the type of room that you booked. Aside from the ghastly 45 minute check-in procedure, this hotel isn't too bad. The room was clean, comfortable and very large. Not the most recently renovated and could probably do with some updating, but as a cheap base for Las Vegas tourism, you can't go far wrong. The monorail is a leisurely walk away and makes getting to the strip very easy and if you buy a 1 or 3 day pass, this is cheap too. I did not try the hotel restaurants - as the hotel is also a small casino, the public areas are quite smokey. Cheap, cheerful and quite a pleasant stay if you live through the check-in process !	
May 24 2007	Good value	A bargain for Las Vegas. The room was very clean, free wireless. Not too far from the strip, but you probably would want to drive over when it's hot. Just a couple blocks to the south, then right on Sahara and park in any casino lot for free. If you don't have a car, the monorail is just down the street. Large pool, but no hot tub. We'll probably stay here in the future.	
May 15 2007	Depend on what you want/need.	Vegas glamour or luxury this is not. If you need a room with out frills and want to be in easy walking distance to the convention center for aound $70 a night this is not a bad place. I would not recommend for anyone other than a conventioneer on a budget. I also suggest the Embassy Suites 2 doors down. It somtimes can be booked for as low as 129.00 and is world above the BW.	
May 13 2007 	Not the best hotel for our last night in Vegas!	Needed to find accommodation for our last night in Las Vegas, but didn't want to risk arriving mid-evening and not being able to find somewhere. We also wanted to get a good night's sleep, so chose not to stay at an airport hotel. Booked this hotel in advance through another hotel in the chain, but wish we hadn't.Approaching the hotel we began to wonder if we had made a mistake!We ended-up in a room facing Paradise Street which was fairly noisy due to traffic. As we were on the first floor, it was difficult getting our luggage up the exterior staircase. The room itself was clean, but in need of decoration. Couldn't understand why there is a waist-high wall between the two beds!We didn't use the restaurant due to the amount of smoke in the casino.We complained about a tear in the bedcover and a stain on the bottom sheet and were given a $20 reduction in our bill by the receptionist. Cost was fairly high, considering what we got.Wouldn't use again.	
Apr 19 2007 	Seen better days how soon before its rebuilt?	I've stayed at this hotel on and off over the years, its proximity to the convention center was always the main selling point. Since I stayed here last- 2years ago-it appears nothing has been fixed! Some of the concrete stairs were even broken, half the lights in the room worked, the safe was broken and the carpet coming up (towel bars falling out too). It was still somewhat clean but clearly had seen better days. The staff just shurgged about the broken items, this is always a busy week for nearby hotels but their lack of care was greater than usual. I asked if they were not fixing anything because they planned to renovate and rebuild and was told that was likely but its up to the owners.I would avoid this hotel form now on unless it is rebuilt or remodelled, try some of the other nearby hotels such as the fairfeild inn or Villa Roma both of whihc I checked and appear in much better shape.	
Apr 16 2007 	We Always Stay Here	We like this little oasis near the strip in Vegas. The 3 story hotel is built around a central courtyard which has a pool, spa, grass, and trees, and a nice covered patio with tables and chairs. At $66 per nite (before tax etc), its a good deal, close to everything. Rooms are large and clean, maybe a little dark; be sure to ask for a room on the courtyard. There is an OK bar and restaurant, and a micro-casino.	
Mar 29 2007 	Not a #1 Choice	Not a terrible hotel but could have been better. After standing in line for maybe 20 min just to check in, we were told the hotel was over booked so our request to be put in a room by friends was not possible. We were also told that because of being over booked, they could not give us a 2 queen bed room which we reserved. We were given a queen w/ a couch bed. That was fine because they gave us the room at a discount rate and were told to check in the next morning to see if there was another 2 queen room available for us. We did have to go up and down some stairs which was difficult with suit cases. Once at our room the first thing was noticed was how big the room was. It was nice to see a small divider wall to give some privacy. We pulled out the couch bed and sat down. The first thing we felt was a bar. The mattress had almost no padding in it. We tried laying down and there was still no padding just bars. We contemplated changing hotels but just decided to rough it. We called down and requested a bunch of pillows and blanks that we were going to line the bed with. 1 person slept on the bed on top of a bunch of pillows and another person slept on the floor on the couch cushions and blankets. The next morning there was another room available right down the hall so we changed rooms. The maid was nice and waited for us to grab all our stuff before she started cleaning. It was also nice to have parking right outside our bed room door. Rooms were nice just not the couch bed. Might stay again if needed but will look for another hotel first.	
Mar 28 2007 	Not bad for the location	Our room was booked as a comp for visit with a time share. Although familiar with Vegas we had never stayed off the strip.Rooms were dated but clean ..check- in staff was very friendly and gave us a pool-side view on the ground floor. As advertised the rooms are larger than a traditional hotel room. The casino consists of only a few slot machines and while the lounge/restaurant may be a bit smoky at times it was adequate for drinks we enjoyed at happy hour. Waiter was very friendly and informative. We utilized the &quot;top of the hour&quot; shuttle service both to and from the airport as well as to the strip (Bally's). I would advise anyone staying here to pay a few bucks and get a rental car. Didnt think I would miss one due to the length of our stay but could have really used one .. not much in the way of restaurants or bars within a reasonable walking distance. Not a real bad area but not sure I would recommend walking around the area late at night...not much traffic in the area late in the evening.	
Mar 4 2007	Never again I'd sleep at the airport first	The only reason I cannot add photos to this review is that the memory card on my camera was full and I didn't wish to delete anything on it. The only good thing I could say about this hotel is that yes, it could have been worse; but also with a little care can be much, much better. The feeling of dread began at the approach, this hotel's comment card brags about 28 years and it looks like it's been around that long with very little care given. The clerks were less than friendly, making it to my room with briefcase, garment bag, and roll-on was difficult in the tiny elevator; set of steps up, aisle, then steps again down. The room had an odor, after opening the fridge (which would have been nice to have) I discovered the source of the smell. The coffee maker(also should have been nice to have) was missing the top which meant the coffee stayed in the basket rather than hitting the pot. (I ran hot water through it twice before using it)Must have been that way for guest before me because there was still coffee on the counter top when I moved it to plug in. The remote did not work, Tv reception was poor (maintenance man who came to replace remote blamed the city cable company). Found that interesting as the hotel I moved to the next day had the same cable provider and their reception was excellent.The &quot;safety&quot; chain lock had been pulled from the door frame so many times that it was ineffective to put into use, the lone screw came out in my hand. After washing out the shower so I could feel comfortable using it I reached for a towel only to have one side of the towel rack fall because it was not anchored into the wall effectively dumping the dry towels into the toilet below it...the mattress sagged so badly I was glad this was a solo trip because the center of the bed is where you're going to be no matter what. At check out when I told the clerk how poor my stay was and why she just shrugged her shoulders which makes me think hearing what I said must happen a lot. Yes, I realize you're not paying strip prices here but come on, the owner or manager should stay a night in this place then decide if they would pay for it. I stayed the rest of my trip at a well known strip hotel and only paid double; for the money the strip hotel is by far the better value-I am a frequent stay diamond memeber of this brand, I hope someone who can make them clean up their act sees this review.	
Feb 20 2007	wedding	Had a great time. Booked 2 rooms, on one of the worst weekends in Vegas, Price was high but due to weekend it was great compared to others. booked in at about 3pm, one room was ready took 1 hour for other room. Both rooms where very clean and LARGE. 2 queen beds in each separrated by a half wall, had part kitchen, no stove or micro. but had safe. Parking was good. Front office very good and very friendly. Small casino and I left a small winner. Restaurant was small but good prices and good food! We had breakfast and served by Maria, She was very friendly and service very good! I will go back here again. It's a little bit of a walk to anywhere, so a car would be good unless walking is for you. I was apprihensive with what I read from the fellow reviews on this site, but took a chance since it was the only place left in town when I book this place at this cost. I don't regret it one second.	
Feb 10 2007 	Great overall stay	I booked this hotel with some doubts because of the bad reviews that it had gotten from several travelers. I must say that I totally disagree that this is a bad hotel. I had prompt courteous service from the staff, check-in and check-out was quick and efficient, and the room was very clean and comfortable. Yes, the walls are a bit thin and allow you to hear noise from outside the room, but I have experienced worse! No traffic noise, no airline noise, or trains to interrupt sleep. I did have a pool/garden view room, so I suspect that helped a lot! The casino is very small with only machines to play, and was a bit smokey but not bad. The bar and restaurant were not crowded, and the food was OK for the price. I would probably stay here again.	
Jan 23 2007 	Stay here at your peril	We checked in after an extremely long wait in a queue with only 5 people in front of us. When we arrived at our room someone else was already in there, we were given another room and that key would not open the door so we checked out and went to the Royal Resort where we have stayed for the previous 10 years. The hotel is:1. Not Secure - anyone could walk in and wait on the stairs or wait around a corner. Landings were dark.2. The rooms were smelly - my brother managed to get in their room and the maid had left a dirty cleaning cloth on the bathroom floor.3. The staff on the desk were not very friendly or helpful with our complaint in fact I felt as if we were putting them out.4. The restaurant is in the bar and reception area so it is on view to everyone. People were smoking and it was very noisy.5. Too far from the strip.6. The lift was very small and it was smelly too.7. Room door not very strong - one kick and it would be open.May I add we do not stay in posh hotels and we are not snobbish but there is a limit to what you can put up with.	
Jan 17 2007 	MARDI GRAS GOOD VALUE	I notice that this hotel has had some bad reviews. We stayed there for 3 nights in November. A spotlessly clean, comfortable room (2 queens), lots of room for us 4 adults. Washbasin outside the bathroom which was great as others could shave, put make up on, without holding the bathroom up.Yes, there are no utensils, etc in the kitchenette, just a fridge and coffemaker - but who wants to cook in Las Vegas!!The reception staff were very efficient and welcoming. Yes, the public areas are quite dark, but we were up the strip or shopping most of the time.Despite the dark restaurant area, do have breakfast there. It was fresh cooked for us, plentiful and reasonable priced. Real tea and good coffee. We had a waitress, Maria, who was very friendly.It was lovely to be able to park right outside our room door, unlike the large strip hotels where you park and then have to walk about 2 miles to get in the hotel and another 2 to your room. We had a bit of noise early one morning (young football team staying) and we complained. Without asking, we were given complimentary full breakfast for the four of us.What more can you ask for - £89 in total for three nights for four of us, including tax, booked through reserveahotel. We would stay there again.	
Dec 30 2006 	Bottom of the Barrel	I had to give the Mardi Gras a 2 because they took our reservation after the Riviera would not. Its a long story... Other than that and a couple of nice shuttle drivers/front desk clerks, the customer service at this place stinks. The &quot;casino&quot; is about a 20 x 20 ft smoke filled room and the restaurant &quot;area&quot; is about 10 tables. The restaurant staff must be rejects from the big casinos.. we even got to witness one bartender's boyfriend / husband threaten another employee by bashing his head against a wall! Lovely. I saw lots of foreigners here.. heed this warning: pay more for a room on the strip where employees wear clean clothing and have some sort of customer service training. Also, you have to wait at least 30 min for cab service from this hotel... As for the room, well, although old it was clean, ours had a sleeping area and a tv viewing area. Very noisy in the morning. I suppose if you had a car and didn't need to use anything but the room, this would be OK. Don't expect too much though.	
Dec 18 2006 	Perfectly Acceptable	Knowing that we would be arriving fairly late on a Friday night, it was hard to justify spending hundreds of dollars for a few hours sleep on the strip. We booked this hotel as an inexpensive Friday night stop-over before moving to the Aladdin the next morning.The motel is an older property located near the Convention Center. It contains a small (and smoky) casino with a bar and restaurant area.The rooms are quite large and include a kitchenette. The bed was adequate and we had a quiet sleep. Our only complaint was the extremely noisy fan in the bathroom that ran anytime the light was on. Free wireless Internet was available in the room which was a nice perk.The motel is within walking distance of the Convention Center monorail stop. For those who enjoy longer walks, the Hilton is the closest large entertainment source. There is also a reasonable mall within a 15-20 minute walk.The casino itself was quite smoky, but not atypical of smaller, off-strip gaming halls.Perfectly adequate for the low cost.	
Nov 21 2006 	An OK Stay	We stayed at the Mardi Gras on a Friday night as it was a reasonably priced hotel in Vegas for a Friday. Location is convenient and the room was OK. The room was big but the kitchen was rather useless as there were no dishes or utensils. No microwave, just a coffee maker. Beds were comfortable and the room was clean. There is a small casino on the property. The elevator is very small, so the stairs are a better (and faster) option. This is an average place that we would use again.	
Nov 13 2006 	Anticipated a poor stay but pleasantly surprised	Plan to head out to Vegas for the 11/10/06 weekend and was suprised that most hotels were totally booked or only had high priced rooms available. I finally found Great Western Mardi Gras, got excited, but then I got very concerned after reading mixed reviews. I then tried to find another hotel but was unsuccessful. When I got to the hotel I was very surprised. The place was buzzing with folks checking in, there were folks watching sports on the big screen in the bar/restaurant area and folks gambling. Everyone seem to be okay. The folks at the check in desk were real nice -- no hassles. Service was quick. The only negative note was when I got to my room (which was nice) there were someone's clothing and bath products on the couch and bathroom area. I don't know why (neither did the front desk). But I did get another room and the room was clean. It was a cozy suite. No folks were hanging around the establishment besides folks staying at the hotel. Location is great -- just off of Paradise, which runs parrellel to the strip (Las Vegas Blvd.) but the traffic moved much quicker than the strip. It's near the monorail and near the Wynn. One night I hung out after 1am, got back to the hotel and got a drink at the bar. The bartender was very pleasant. It's a real comfortable place. Obviously it can't compete with the major hotels but I had a wonderful, safe and relaxing stay.	
Nov 10 2006 	Stay Away	Ok. I wanted cheap and purchased from Hotwire, but this was a dump for its rating. Don't ever come here knowing in advance. There were beer guzzling characters out front. The hallways were dark, the tiny elevator had seizures on it on the way up and the soundproofing was poor. To add to the indignity, the room wasn't clean. Lest you think that I am a whining, chronic complainer, I have never written a negative Trip Advisor review before.	
Oct 11 2006	Not clean!	The room was not cleaned up right: there were hairs in the shower, a dirty towel was still in the bathroom. Also there was a used coffee-bag in the machine...did they clean at all?????	
Oct 9 2006 	Great Hotel off the Strip	My husband and I went to the Mardi Gras in Las Vegas it was all we could afford as we did a multi destination trip and we were renewing our wedding vowes there.On arrival we found the staff to be very pleasent they helped us with our luggage and made sure we were comfortable in our room.We chose this hotel as it has accessible rooms (my husband is in a wheelchair). As disabled rooms go we found this to be about 85% accessible just a little problem with the toilet which we got around between us.The downside is that the shuttle bus is not wheelchair accessible which ment the only way to the strip was either to walk it (if you are fit enough) or if you get the monorail which is fine but quite expensive over 5 days we spent approx $105 on monorail fares or of course taxis if you are really rich, the buses are accessible but again you need to get the monorail to get the bus to freemont st.The view may not have been fantastic but for a base it was good, we felt quite safe walking back from the monorail centre even at 1.30am, we asked about the area at the monorail centre who said that it was next to a 5* hotel so the area is perfectly safe. We had no problem at all.The restaurant and meals we found to be very resonable for the evening, we didn't bother with breakfast we just went to the 7 eleven up the road the night before to pick up milk and cereal which we were able to put in the room fridge.Overall we found no fault with this hotel apart from not being able to use the complimentary shuttle bus which put added expense on our trip.We would go there again.	
Oct 6 2006 	On a budget? This is the place to go.	Me and a friend stayed at the Best Western on Paradise in May for 7 nights, and as far as a base is concerned, this was perfect. 2 minutes away from the main strip, 100m from the mono-rail, which drops u off at about 6 different hotels if you didnt want to pay for taxis. The staff were friendly, especially the 2 bar maids. Check in was a bit of a slow process due to there being only 2 receptionists but we got there in the end. The rooms were very large with a good amount of storage space. The bathroom was tiny, and when your'e 6'1, you need all the space u can get. I ended up getting dried in the main room due to the vast amount of space there was. The views are ok if u get an internal room. That faces the pool and gardens, if your not so lucky, as we were, you get an outside facing room and i can tell you that you wouldn't want to really be walking round that area late at night. It's a bit seedy ! The food was very good and i can recommend the T-Bone steak and everything was reasonably priced. Overall, if u want somewhere that's cheap and to lay your head and get freshened up, this'll be fine. If your after luxury, get a hotel on the strip.	
Oct 5 2006 	Not Recommended	First the good bit - rooms are large and beds are comfortable. The air con worked fine and was needed! The bad bits - when we arrived, having been on the go for 23 hours, we found ourselves waiting at reception for over 10 minutes. Two receptionists were dealing with customers, a third clearly had important paperwork to complete before he could deal with us. Once his paperwork was complete he did deal with us quickly and efficiently.Their Welcome Pack says you will get help from their friendly porters. When we asked for assistance with our luggage (we were a party of four with one disabled member) we were told they did not offer porter assistance but we &quot;might&quot; be able to find a luggage trolley &quot;out back.&quot; We struggled through the hotel lobby to the rear exit and by chance found a trolley which we then had to manhandle to the other end of the complex and into the elevator to the third floor. A porter near the scene disappeared with some alacrity but surprisingly re-appeared once we had off loaded the luggage into our rooms. Perhaps he expected a tip for &quot;providing&quot; the trolley but he didn't get one!For four or five nights we found the plumbing to be extremely noisy and were woken up at 1 am, 3 am and 5 am on different occasions. The water kept running (seemed to be refilling cisterns) for anywhere between 10 minutes and 45 minutes. Sleep was impossible. Strangely this didn't seem to happen at the weekends. They say they have a free shuttle to the Strip. No they don't. They have a free shuttle to the western end of Bally's on Flamingo. You have a quarter of a mile hike from there to the Strip.The food was OK but compared to other hotels was a bit on the pricey side, e.g. $8.50 for breakfast whilst in Terrible's (just up the road) the same breakfast was less than $5 and we thought the food in Terrible's was noticeably better. The breakfast buffet in the Mardi Gras was OK but eating in the so called restaurant meant eating in the bar complete with smoke and noisy gaming machines and one or two over excited sports fans.Room cleaning was a bit spasmodic. The beds were made and towels were changed but other than that nothing was touched.It was a place to sleep, it's not the worst hotel in Vegas and its location isn't too bad but it is definitely not value for money and it certainly put us off Best Western hotels and motels for the future.	
Sep 13 2006 	Cheap Hotel with good rooms	Stayed at the Best Western in august 2006. Found all the staff very helpful and friendly - good to chat to the bar staff to find places to go which are off the strip.Rooms where cleaned everyday. Cold water provided in rooms at $2.50 per bottle. Fresh towels / soap etc also provided.The air conditioning was powerful, kept the room cool all night.Food was ok - nothing great but good value.Bonus is the shuttle taxi to the strip and to the airport.	
Aug 31 2006 	Not at all worth $80 when cheaper alternatives are better	This hotel ranked lowest out of 5 hotels my wife and I stayed at during our honeymoon week in the US.Without having done proper research, I randomly booked a hotel for a Saturnight. What a mistake it was. On arrival at 10pm, we found a few individuals outside the front door sitting around drinking beer  not a welcoming sight, and my wife would have had us leave if not for the fact that we had placed a credit card guarantee for the $80 room rate.Once inside, we saw that Reception was located right next to the casino, which explained the type of people coming and going through the front door.The reception staff were cold, insincere and never smiled. They mechanically processed our registration and handed us our keys. We rushed out of the noisy lobby as quickly as we could.The room itself was acceptable, with a nice large counter top and ample space. It was curious, however, that the phone wasnt next to the bed, and that the TV was located in the lounge area of the room, not at the foot of the bed. HOWEVER, within minutes of settling in, my wife and I were both being bitten by bugs in the lounge area! Fortunately, they didnt bother us while we were sleeping.The pool looked inviting, but we didnt bother trying  we were out of there the next morning and rushed ourselves out to Americas Best Value Inn (half the price, and ranked 3rd out of the 5 hotels we stayed at).	
Aug 17 2006	Stay away from the Mardi Gras!!!	Watch out! This place will charge for a &quot;no show&quot; even when you stay there and pay for your room! Very unfriendly staff who really don't care about their customers.	
Aug 15 2006	Place is Cheap for surerather pay more or find other inexpensive place	As others have written the Staff is largely Unhelpful, harried, and almost downright rude.They get this &quot;vibe,attitude&quot; from the Ownership who are by the way Australian. If you are not an Aussie, look out! The rudeness,unfriendliness will extend from the guests as well as from Mgmt. Most peeps are very uptight there, Yes, the rooms are OK but the pool is actually kinda small with Aussies,rude ones all around being very ridiculously obnoxious, arrogant, and downright unpleasant. I would never stay here again no matter how Cheap it is, because the place itself is Cheap and Unwelcoming.	
Aug 11 2006	Cheap Option away from the Strip	We chose this hotel as it was a cheaper option to staying on The Strip. Our first impressions when we walked in were &quot;what a dump&quot;. The downstairs reception and gaming area is tired, tatty and could do with refurbishing. Our room, however, was large and clean with a good sized lounge area partitioned off from the bedroom area. The bathroom was clean and the small kitchen had a fridge (bonus in the heat) but no utensils and our air conditioning unit, thankfully, was efficient, modern and quiet. If you opt for 2 queen beds you lose the lounge area. There was no concierge when we were there and the front desk staff were harried and unhelpful. Guest Services turned out to be the front desk and getting any information was akin to pulling teeth. The girl I was asking just wanted to get rid of me so she could presumably get on with her front desk duties. We stayed here for 4 nights and without a doubt, it was a much cheaper option than staying on the Strip. You are very close to all the entertainment and if you can overlook the considerable lack of interest displayed by the staff and the very run down public areas, it is an OK place to stay. The pool was well used and kept in good condition and they also had a laundry room which was very useful.	
Aug 4 2006	Big rooms and friendly employees!	This motel surprised me! It was not only clean, but the room is gigantic and the bed was very comfortable! The rooms are more like suites and have a small kitchen area.There is no fancy decor, but who cares! We weren't there to admire the furnishings!The employees were extremely freindly and helpful. They went out of their way to treat us like special guests.If we ever go back to Las Vegas, I'm pretty certain this will be the motel I choose to stay at again and again!	
Jul 31 2006	Recommended only for the Budget-Conscience	Well this place certainly does not look like the Bellagio , nor does it have the ambience of the Luxor or the other cool Hotel/Casinos on the Strip. Some of us were a little embarrassed upon arrival but had a sense of humor about the hotel after a while. We stayed here because of a wedding that was to be held in the reception room, and there were several of us that booked under a special reservation. After arrival, I called the bride-to-be and warned her it was only so-so and some of the guests may be compelled to stay somewhere else. The bride-to-be, who only did research on Vegas wedding packages and never really saw it in person, called several members of the family and apologized in advance. She arrived, not impressed, and only stayed one nite in Mardi Gras and relocated to the Hilton down the street. But all in all, we agreed that there were probably worst places in vegas than this and overall, my stay wasn't bad. We had no trouble finding a cab-just wait outside off the main road and lots of them will stop. This hotel served the purpose of providing a less expensive stay, and it was located only a couple of minutes from the Strip. The lobby as you walk in, is smoky and small. And I'd like to thank the little punk who let off the stink bomb as we were checking in-it was awful! The casino consists of maybe 30 slot machines and that's it. The bar was pretty informal, but Jeri the blonde bartender rocks! She made us feel welcome and make us awesome drinks. The rooms were big, mine was very clean and smelled ok, but I checked in early. Other family members that arrived got keys to rooms that hadn't been cleaned yet. And the keys to the rooms- they give you cards with magnetic strips and almost all of us had problems getting in our rooms. Frequent swipes is what is required and some of us had to go to the front desk and ask for another card to get into our room. Another less than desireable feature is some of the seedy looking characters that hung around the hotel-I noticed this too and not sure if they were guests, or just locals. Lots of foreigners stay here since it's cheaper. Like I said, the rooms are great size with a sofa and a table, but they have those noisy old A/C units in them. If all you want is a clean place to stay that's really affordable, this may do the trick but do not expect anything fancy.	
Jul 31 2006	NEEDS IMPROVEMENT. YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR	I have to agree with the previous reviewer about the poor cleanliness of the roooms. My review is similar. I had a large block of rooms booked here for a weekend in July. Me and the groom only had the misfortune of staying 1 night since we booked the Hilton down the street for the following 2 nights but our families were here so this did not make me happy. The hotel is located right off the strip, in an older section. It is obvious from looking at the hotel that it is older and needs renovation. The check in process was a fiasco. Numerous mistakes made in booking the group reservation, so it took us an hour to check in. When we did get to our rooms, both were dirty. Had not been cleaned so we went back to the front desk and got 2 more rooms. I was really hot and in a bad mood so I just wanted my room. I proceeded to take a shower and the drain was totally clogged, and the little knob on the shower button came off. Since it is older and a motel, you get one of those wall mounted A/C units. Ours was loud and noisy but some of the rooms did have newer quiet units. My parents room was also dirty when they checked in, so had to get another room. My friends room had sunflower seeds on the floor and some sort of grease spot on the table where the TV sits. Somebody was sitting there and noticed they had grease on their shorts. It is obvious the maids do not clean everything in the rooms, as the grease spot or whatever was there (tanning oil maybe) from the previous guest was not cleaned. The breakfast buffet is $8.50. Selection is so -so, no pancakes or french toast but you could make your own waffles. This hotel does not attract the classiest of clientele and there were alot of wierdos hanging out at the hotel along with some sleazy looking women [---------------]. The only positive things about this place were the big rooms, they are nice size, and the banquet room was set up nicely for my wedding reception, food display was great. The catering manager and the florist was very helpful. Although the hotel itself is not very nice and I would not stay there again, the reception and the food were good for a reasonable price. We only paid $60/night here on the weekend which is a steal for Vegas, but still, spend a few more $$4 and stay in a nicer hotel. There are nicer hotels right next door to this one. I am really surprised Best Western attaches its name to this property. It is pretty obvious nobody from Corp. has done any QA on this recently, I do not see how they can pass QA with cleanliness problems of the rooms. Always remember, you get what you pay for.	
Jul 31 2006 	4 Danes going all the way to lovely Las Vegas	A good place to keep cool in Vegas! We where 2 adults and 2 kids travelling to Vegas for 5 nights and this hotel is absolutely recommended is you want away from the circus at the Strip. The hotel has a free shuttle to the Strip, so we left the car at the hotel. We got an upgrade for USD 5 pr night for a large room next to the pool. 2 large beds and a small kitchen without hardware, but a fridge to keep the drinks cold (a necessity). Rooms, pool and hotel was nice and clean and a good place to stay for a fair amount of money. There was also a self service laundry. The restaurant served a good portion of ribeye under USD 10,- and a frozen Margarita for only a dollar. Wow! The kids loved the pool!	
Jul 19 2006 	Don't Stay Here!!!	Problems:1. They are not wireless in the rooms. They told us to go to the lobby and sit and use the laptop.2. Pool said open until 9:00 PM. They lock up early and find excuses.3. Maid steals the water in the room that the hotel charges for and the hotel tries to charge you for it. 4. Maid service daily??? Nope, it's whenever they want. The hotel knocked on the door at 1:00 AM. Probably to check if you were there. If not, come in and steal.5. Had a package overnighted to the hotel, and the owner signed for it. The idiots checked for it for 2 days until they found it.6. Plan on waiting in line to register for at least 20 minutes. The delay is because of all the guests complaining about the rooms and service.7. When taking a shower, the tub didn't drain, so it became a lake.8. Bathroom door doesn't latch.9. Police had 3 men spread-eagled in the parking lot. It definately isn't safe in that area.10. Over priced for the breakfast.11. Rooms are old and not maintained, mattresses lumpy, super small bathroom.12. TV didn't work, it was faint screen with lines across it. The maintenance man, Willie, brought up a different TV. He was wonderful, a good employee. Probably the only good employee they had.My advice to all is avoid this hotel like the plaugue.	
Jul 13 2006	Great Friendly Hotel	We had mixed feelings about the Mardi Gras after reading some of the reviews from this website, but were pleasantly pleased by this place.We found the hotel easily from the airport (we hired a car) and found check in staff friendly and co-operative.This hotel only has slot machines, there is only a small section filled with the machines. The bar is small and personal, much better than the larger hotels on the strip. We found it easy to make friends with the staff and fellow holidaymakers who we saw on a day-to-day basis. The pool is small but it was never over crowded, we always found a sunbed.The bar staff are great fun, food was great we did not have cause to complain about anything, Bret and Jason were very entertaining guys who really looked after us.Overall if you are looking for a personal, fun stay in Vegas away from the 24-7 strip, we would highly recommend this hotel. We will be staying again next year.	
Jun 26 2006	Perfectly nice	We weren't looking for anything fancy in Vegas, so we picked this place off the Strip. The service was friendly, the check-in lines weren't long, and our room was nice, with lots of counter space and a fridge, and a really comfortable bed. I was disappointed that there wasn't internet access in the room. Our room was across from the pool, and there was some music and talking at night, but only just a bit. The pool closes at 9 PM so it wasn't a problem. We've learned to bring earplugs when we stay at hotels, which I highly recommend. They're a life saver!This hotel has a great location because of its proximity to the Monorail: a pricey but very convenient and super reliable way to get to the Strip. It's very easy to use, and isn't even 1/4 mile up the road from the hotel.We don't gamble (we just turned 21) so we didn't use the casino.This place is absolutely fine, if nothing special. But we came to Vegas for Vegas, not the hotel. :) I would come back again!	
Jun 7 2006	Not a good experience	This was our last hotel stop after driving around southern Utah, before flying on to New York. We booked this in advance of the holiday and if our previous experiences of Best Western hotels was anything to go by, we should have been very pleased. Not quite so. The check-in desk is completely overwhelmed by the noise of the slot machines because this hotel lobby is packed full of them. We were given a room that was away from the road and was quiet and being able to park the car outside the door did improve things. The room was clean but the decor, furniture and bed linen were very tired. The whole place needed renovating and brightening up. The pool looked ok but as it is small and crowded by the buildings around it, it wasn't inviting. Breakfast was offered in the seating area opposite the check-in desk and even at 8 in the morning, it was noisy and over crowded. Poeple had been waiting in the queue to be seated for at least 10 minutes and the people who had started their breakfast, were complaining with some people simply leaving their half eaten meals on the table. It did not bode well but we were not to be put off. Pity really because the food that was meant to be hot, was only warm and the time it took to arrive at the table may have explained why. Even the staff were complaining about the problems.	
Jun 3 2006 	Clean Good Food and Cheap Beer!!	My company booked this hotel for a convention in May 2006. Let's just say it's average. It is better than some and not as good as others. I had room 3145 which is a king poolside on the 3rd floor. The room was very clean with a loveseat,chair, end table, and coffee table, and there was a nook with a sink, dorm sized refrigerator, a sink, and a 4 cup coffeemaker. The food in the restaurant is very good and very reasonable, but service is a little slow at times. A huge club sandwich is $7.95 and is larger than most typical restaurants. The beer is cheap compaired to everywhere else in Las Vegas. A large draft is $3.00 there is a happy hour every night from 4pm-6pm and some nights it was from 12am-6am as well. The bar is open 24/7 and the restaurant is open from 6am-midnight. The shuttle takes you to Bally's (Near Caesars Palace/Paris) and to the airport. This is every hour on the hour until 11pm. Take advantage of the shuttle to Bally's as this will save you at least one way of cab fare to/from the strip. They will also pick you up at Bally's if you call and let them know. It is also only about 300 yards from the Las Vegas Convention Center and the Las Vegas Monorail station at the Convention Center. I'll reiterate what other reviews have said as well. It's definately not a 4 star property, but overall it's safe, clean, and not to out of the way. Visit their website directly at: [-] where they have web only specials that other sites can't beat and that includes [-].	
May 23 2006	would not recommend	i stayed in the mardi gras with my partner in may 2006 for a week. i arrived on the sunday,the following morning we went out for breakfast, and on return to the room i noticed my mobile phone had gone from my bedside table,and that the cleaner had been in the room,which if you put 2 and 2 together i believe either the cleaner took my phone of somebody went in the room while she was cleaning which is not very good!! the staff when i reported this were not helpful at all,and were sometimes very rude.i found they were not helpful at reception and didnt really know what they were doing.the hotel is probably a 40 minute walk from the centre of the strip,however ther is a free shuttle service which takes you to the ballys hotel,however this was always full as it only holds 10 people so you were waiting sometimes up to an hour for your turn.the drinks at the bar were reasonably priced.while staying at the hotel i also had two towels taken from off our sunbeds so if you do decide to stay here just becareful with your personal possesions.	
May 16 2006	Worth the Price Service lacking	For the price, the room is defnitely worth it. Large room with a small kitchen area with fridge. Housekeeping is lacking to say the least. Staff only works till 4, so after that you're outta luck. Location off-strip is perfect if you frequent vegas and know your way around. Staff is definitely hit or miss as previous poster said. One person can be extremely friendly, while the next is very rude. So if you get a good price, room is definitely worth it as you will not spend much time there.	
Apr 24 2006	Convenient Location - VERY nice place	I stayed @ the Mardi Gras Inn April 21-23. MGI is excellently located on Paradise Road just south of the Hilton, Convention Center, and Monorail Station. The VERY large bed I had was very good, though i spent most of the time out on the town. Room 2161 was very clean and quiet. If you get a room near the pool area, it might be noisy. Some teenage sports team was there and they did make lotsa noise. MGI does have a restaurant which seemed very nice. I did not eat there so I can't attest to the food quality. Make sure you call once you arrive for the hotel shuttle. It runs every hour until I believe midnight. They will take you to Bally's on the strip during their airport runs. I bought it through Priceline for $120 a night + taxes (weekend) Check through Best Western for better pricing, however I was there during the NAB convention and rooms were hard to get.Definitely worth it, Really NO complaints	
Apr 23 2006	Fantastic value for money and closer to the strip then you think	We recently stayed at this hotel and I was pleasantly surprised, the rooms are massive and clean which is a BIG plus for me. The staff were helpful and the shuttle buss which runs from 8am to 11pm was a god send. It takes you into Ballys, which is a hotel we had never heard of but from there you can get to Paris, Caesars palace and more. The monorail station is literally 2 mins down the road and from there you can get to ANYWHERE on the strip. I would defiantly stay here again, why spend hundreds of dollars on a room which looks like an old French hotel room, which will take you 30 mins to get to your room when you can spend a lot less on a clean, large room, moments away from the strip. You can go and visit all the hotels and see the décor  dont pay for it. This place gets a 10 out of 10 for me. Thanks guys for a great holiday.	
Apr 14 2006	Friendly Staff	The best part of this hotel is the staff. They were very friendly and helpful. We also liked not having to walk a mile to get to our room. The room we had was larger than expected. There was a mini kitchen area. Sleeping areas are divided by an archway. Only one TV. The price was great and the room was clean. No complaints.	
Mar 28 2006	Problems at the Mardi Gras BW	We stayed March 24 thru the 27th. During that time our room was cleaned only once. Trash was left &amp; no condiments were given for coffee maker in the room. Last day there was no cook in the restaurant &amp; could not order breakfest. We got what we paid for, cheap. Overall, staff was friendly but not very helpful.	
Mar 18 2006 	Won't stay anywhere else in vegas	I stayed here for a Passion Parties Convention this March. Since it was &quot;convention time&quot;, &quot;Spring Break Week&quot; and &quot;Nascar week&quot; everywhere else was outrageously priced. After packing my entire family into one tiny room last year, that I paid $140 a night for, there was NO WAY I was paying that again for a tiny little room. I read some bad and some good reviews of the Mardi Gras. So the main reason I decided to stay there since the &quot;nightly average&quot; was about 100 per night. I have to say that their customer service at the desk wasn't the best. Not just at checkout but throughout the whole stay. One of the nights we were there their phones were down completely and we couldn't call to see when the shuttle was making it's last run to Bally's to pick us up. However, the rooms were clean. When my TV didn't work, instead of getting me a new TV, they moved me to a new room. Which was just as clean. The room was HUGE. It had a nice living room area, kitchenette and bed area. You could see the TV from the bed if you wanted to lay around and veg. The restaurant in the front lobby had good food. However, there was a sign in the room to call down and order pizza and when I tried this when I first checked in, after a 7 hour flight, they said &quot;We don't have any pizza&quot;. They have a free shuttle that picks you up/drops you off at the airport every 30 minutes or so. The sign in the hotel says every hour but the shuttle drivers were going every half. The shuttle also brings you to Bally's for free. So you can reach the strip and see all the sights with no problem. I also have to say that it was more like a &quot;upscale motel&quot; than a &quot;hotel&quot;. But for the money, the size of the room, the cleanliness and the nice courtyard in the middle with the pool and gazebo, I'll stay there again and again and again. Especially since I won't be going to convention during Nascar and Spring Break Week next year!	
Mar 17 2006 	Great for Conventions	Rooms are really mini suites with seperate bedroom area, small kitchen with coffee maker, sink, and small frig. Ask for one bed instead of two and you will get a sofa also. Food is good for price and steaks are USDA Choice. A short walk to the convention center and Steve Wynns shuttle to his hotel make this a good location in spite of being off the strip. Bottom line... if you don't need to impress someone or be where the action is, this is not a bad place at all. I like the fact that you can get to your room in a snap. You can't do that at a big mega resort on the strip. Ask for an inside room facing the pool or courtyard. Tip..... Budget minded Europeans are known to frequent this place and some tend to go topless on warm days by the pool.	
Mar 6 2006 	For self-employed convention goers	I keep coming back to the Mardi Gras (six stays so far) on business because I'm self-employed and this is the cheapest hotel within a five minute walk of the Convention Center. (It is never one of the &quot;official&quot; convention hotels.) The rooms are big, reasonably clean, have a bar and fridge area for fixing snacks, and I like a cool pool. The tacky lobby/casino/restaurant area is to be avoided, as it easily can be. Prices are creeping up here, as they are everywhere in Vegas, but it's still the best value anywhere nearby.	
Feb 25 2006	wasnt disappointed	After reading a lot of negative reviews about this hotel we were wondering what we had let ourselves in for.we arrived at about 2pm the guy on reception was very pleasant we asked for a pool view and non smoking room and that is what we got.i was expecting to be greeted by a wall of smoke but the casino area was quite smoke free,it was a bit smokier on the weekend.Going into our room we had our eyes shut and fingers crossed,it was a pleasant surprise the room was very clean,nice fluffy towelsin the bathroom,no shower gel but hey that wouldnt spoil our holiday, we always take that with us anyway even when we stay in a 5 star.The fridge was clean as was the kitchenette.you have to get a pin to use the safe the guy on front desk told us it was $2a day but it was worth it.when we took it back on checking out we didnt get charged said it was included in our package.pool was very clean i think that was because no one used it.it was not heated like getting into an ice bath that was the only downside to this motel.the staff were friendly gave us extra coffee etc for our room when asked for.it is in an ideal location you can walk to circus circus in about 20-30 mins or you can use the monorail about 10 mins walk or the hotel shuttle bus which was free.Didnt get a chance to sample the food ,We would definately come back again it was good value for money	
Feb 21 2006	OK If You REALLY Can't Afford To Stay On The Strip	My friend and I stayed here for 5 nights over Valentines weekend for his brothers wedding (the bride and groom wisely chose to stay at the Bellagio!)We on the other hand were on a strict budget and for that reason booked into the Mardi Gras.Service and staff helpfulness varied drastically. Depending on who was managing the front desk we were either pleasantly suprised or left open-mouthed at the incomptetence and rudeness of some staff members.After an 19 hour trip we arrived to find they'd booked us a double room with only 1 bed. My friend and I are close, but not that close! We rang down to the front desk who were polite but insistant that that's what we'd booked - we hadn't. After a miserable night (with me on the sofa)we were allocated a more suitable room - the one we had initially booked and profound apologies. The domestic staff were extremley helpful taking our bags to the new room and providing us with various toiletries which we'd forgotten to bring with us.The rooms themselves are surprisingly spacious, although the same cannot be said for the bathrooms. Basic, average and no-frills are a fair description.Location-wise you're fairly out of it here. The Strip is a 20-30 minute walk away. Although cabs vary from 7-11 dollars and the mono rail is 5 mins walk away.However, the hotel does provide a courtesy shuttle bus to Ballys on The Strip and to the airport, which is useful.Food-wise, you're best off heading on to The Strip for all meals where you'll get a better deal for you're money. That said we had breakfast at the Mardi Gras a couple of times and it certainly wasn't terrible.All in all it's fine if you just want somewhere to lay your head but by the time you've added cab fares/mono rail tickets to the price of your trip you're probably better off taking time to search for something a bit more interesting and well located on The Strip.	
Jan 21 2006	Good Hotel - Shame about the Check-In	We had problems on arrival with the check-in. We were told we weren't expected till I pointed our names out on their arrivals sheet. They then allocated us a room, already occupied. After 16 hrs travelling from the UK, it is not the sort of hastle you need.However once sorted and in a room, we were pleasantly surprised. The rooms are well laid out, with the bedroom area, separated from the living room by a open screen, with the kitchen area separate again. The living area is quite large and gives a good impression.The outer side just looks onto the car parks, but the inner side over looks the pool and a grassed seating area.The bathroom was well decorated and clean, with the towels changed when required.The room was cleaned everyday without exception and the coffee topped up.The downside is breakfast. The resturant is far to small for a hotel of this size and queues can be rather large. Unfortunately there was no crockery in the kitchenette, so you couldnt have cereals etc. Its just as quick to walk up to the Hilton (20 mins away) and have a 12 dollar, eat as much as you can breakfast.We didnt use the pool, so cant comment to much, although it is on the small side.The bus runs on the hour to the strip (Ballys), although I believe with a little monetary incentive, the driver will go a bit further.The strip is a 25 min walk away.The convention centre is 10 mins walk and also the nearest monorail stop (if its working, which it wasnt for the week we were there).There is a small shop on site, with a petrol station and other shops about 10 mins walk away.Overall, if you want a reasonably priced off stripHotel then this is a good choice. They just have to get the check-in sorted out.Remember though, this is a 2 Star hotel. If you want 5 star luxury, try the Bellagio (at 10 times the price). And its Vegas, you aren't going to be spending a lot of time in the room.	
Jan 18 2006 	Avoid this hotel	My company booked rooms in this hotel for a convention. It is easily the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. The room was very large but filthy. The carpets and furniture didn't look clean, there was mold in the shower, and the kitchenette was nothing short of disgusting. The area around this hotel is run down and since no cabs stop here, there is no way to get to restaurants or entertainment without a rental (or a long, probably dangerous walk). The desk staff were friendly but that doesn't come close to making up for this hotel's problems.	
Jan 12 2006	It was okay for the money	The Hotel staff at the Front desk was very helpful and friendly. The persons working in the Casino seemed to be put out if they had to get a cocktail or drink for you. Very smoky in the lobby(checkin &amp; casino). The rooms were adequate in size, however not the cleanest rooms. The linens and bathroom were clean. The carpets were not, looked like they were spot vacuum not reaching the edges or near the tables.	
Jan 11 2006	Very good Deal	Definitely not a luxury hotel- but, at the price, a great place to have a clean, comfortable, very roomy place to sleep conveniently off strip. Terrific room layout- with the wall separating the beds. Coffee maker and fridge a welcome touch after the $5 coffee and $5 waters of the strip hotels.Bottom line- a great way to save money on weekends (I paid $60 with tax) or long-stays if you don't need pampering.	
Nov 3 2005	Great location for off strip budget holiday	Visit 2 years ago stayed at the Luxor;this visit on tighter budget but love Las Vegas.The Mardi Gras is basic but rooms are good size;fridge&amp; Coffee maker great asset;could be cleaner but I guess huge turn over in staff.Pool area-you could be in the sun all day if wanted to &amp; only 1 minute back to your room; likewise when returning to hotel you can be in your room in 2 minutes, took 30mins at the Luxor.Best part! 5 minutes to Monorail station running until2a.m.or got free Wynn shuttle bus across from monorail,could be on the strip in 15 minutes.Hotel shuttle available &amp; Bus stops near as well.Would definetely stay again for price &amp; access.	
Oct 27 2005	Tired off strip hotel	A Very tired hotel. The room was larger than average but was not cleaned well. Still food in fridge from previous occupant! Not far from the Monorail but not a pleasant walk after dark. Cheaper hotels on the strip.	
Oct 17 2005	grim and grime	Dull and jaded decor lousy area--poor service should be renamed The Pits	
Sep 28 2005	smokey	We asked for a non-smoking room when we booked this hotel. When we checked in, no non-smoking room was available anymore, so we got a smoking room. The smell was awful! We asked for some intensive ventilation or air spray to move this smell from the room. During our 2 night stay nobody showed up, although we asked four (!) times. After our stay my clothes also smelled like tobacco.Hairs have been found in the shower, the airco was also not working very well.From the outside it was possible to shift the window glasses out of the window, and so it was possible to open the room door from the outside.Plus: they gave us a breakfast refund because nobody showed up to refresh the air in the room. There are better and cheaper hotels in Las Vegas!	
Sep 22 2005	Mardi Gras Las Vegas	Had a brilliant time. Hotel was very nice will definately go there again. We went self catering. Hotel food was really nice staff were all friendly and were always there to help you. Pool was lovely and clean. Free shuttle bus was a god send. Can't wait to go again to Las Vegas and will hopefully stay at the Mardi Gras again.	
Sep 13 2005 	Worst place I've ever stayed!! Beware!	Upon arrival, my non-smoking room I had reserved was not available, so I ended up in a smelly, dark, smoking room. The carpets and linens were filthy. I came back one day around lunchtime to find several of the cleaning staff in the doorway of my room, smoking and watching soap operas! The casino was dark and full of smoke, elevator was shaky and also smoky, and I was afraid to come back to the hotel alone at night. I travel frequently, often to foreign countries and this is by far the scariest and dirtiest place I've ever been. To top it off, they charged my debit card I had used to hold the room, instead of the credit card I gave them at check-in, which resulted in overdraft fees. Best Western corporate was going to refund the fees, but the management of the hotel (privately owned, not corporate) refused and also would not return phone calls or e-mails. I would rather sleep on the streets than stay here!	
May 30 2005	excellent value	we stayed at the mardi gras for 11 days in may.we found the staff very helpful and friendly.the rooms were large,clean and comfortable with clean linen and towels daily supplied by very friendly housekeepers.coffee making facilities,fridge,tv and a much needed air conditioning unit worked well.pool area and sun deck well maintained and never overcrowded the times we used it .food and drink was very reasonably priced .the strip was about 20/25 minute walk away but with the new monorail 5mins away and running every 5mins you could get anywhere on the strip within 10 mins.although not as grand as hotels on the strip not as expensive either.we would recomend the mardi gras for anyone looking for a good value mid range hotel and we would certainly choose to stay here when next in vegas.the shuttle service ran every hour which we used on several occasions and had no problems ran on time.gina and kevin.	
May 24 2005	thought it was great	stayed a week, it was just finerooms were very clean, large and relatively quiet. It is a great place if you want to be close to the strip (via the monorail) but need to unwind out of the husltle and bustle.Monorail is about three blocks, timely and drops you off on some hotel on the The Strip. 2 dollars, tickets are cheap and a trip on the monorail is a great way to meet people, you are dropped off on the back side of various casinos. If you want to go point to point, take the monorail to the first stop and then take the bus ( 2 dollars, cash)Room was cleaned above average every day, the staff was helpfull, the pool area was great, the size of the rooms was more than I hoped, the elevator was always quick, there is a security guard checking the area, the casino and bar/restaurant is pretty small by vegas standards, but seemed to be a favorite local hang-out. Most of the guests I met (who were all very friendly) seemed to be from Europe or Asia. Local take-out food delivered in a reasonable amount of time.Convenience stores just down the block, a really interesting guy runs the &quot;gift-shop&quot;. If you want to stay in Vegas and have a home base this is the place. didn't see alot of families, but why would you bring a family to Vegas?	
May 22 2005	Good for the money	Lobby: Avoid it if you can, especially if you are a non-smoker. The front desk staff are very attentive and seem to be able to handle the large amount of traffic that goes through the front deskRooms: Our room was very clean. It was nice and spacious and seem to have a kitchenette w/o the stove or microwave. It might have been one in years' past, but it was a nice place to put everything. I also liked the fact that the two beds were seperated within the room (you can see a picture of this on the Best Western website).Pool/Jacuzzi: Okay for sunbathing, but the jacuzzi was not even remotely hot enough and the pool was not heated, so too cold to go into. It was clearly kept up though and the entire outside was clean.Restaurants: Did not have a chance to eat at their restaurants, but there is a McDonald's within walking distance.	
May 17 2005 	Not bad for the price	Traveled to Las Vegas for a quick business trip - choose this hotel for price and location to business, not strip.The lobby is a bit sketchy, I was a little worried when checking in. However, room was very large (as compared to more expensive hotels) and clean. AC worked great and housekeeping did a nice job. TV was fine - who watches TV in Vegas anyways? Never got to the pool, but seemed very popular and crowded. Staff was helpful for the most part, but shuttle service is dismal. Extremely inconvenient and not worth the bother. As one reviewer wrote, it's a LONG walk to the strip - however, legitemate cabs with friendly drivers always seemed to be out front whenever I walked out the door.Dinner at the restaurant was good and people watching was very entertaining. However, I wouldn't recommend chatting anyone up. Was able to pay cash for breakfast brunch thingy and staff members were concerned that I hadn't gotten my moneys worth by taking too little!	
May 15 2005	Great place to stay	It was my first time visiting Las Vegas. I stayed at 3500 Paradise Road. It was Christmas, and I had a wonderful Christmas. I had a clean room, maid service was great. Staff was great. I will be returning there this week, and will be staying at this same hotel. I have no complaints, except the breakfast was a little slow in coming, otherwise, nice place to stay. Lita, the lady at the desk is very nice and helpful, and she tries to give you the best room possible for the money. I will be visiting Vegas again this Christmas, and plan to stay there again.	
Apr 14 2005	Yuck	Our travel agent suggested this place because most places were full, what a scary place. On Paradise road, not paradise by far, there was road construction and lots of traffic, the people hanging around the casino were very shady. The room is large with a frig bar area, tv's don't work well, hasn't been updated in years, poor maid service, dirty sheets, dust among other things under beds, most maids don't speak english and nosiy fan in bathroom, wouldn't stay again, BEWARE	
Apr 7 2005	Not Impressed....	Stayed there for two weeks and as much as we love Vegas,couldn't wait to go home.This hotel really spoilt the holiday.The staff weren't very friendly (we were told they were?).We couldn't have breakfast one morning because we didn't have a voucher (obviously cash isn't acceptable these days)but were told we could purchase food in the restaurant which also happens to be the bar area.We found somewhere to eat on the &quot;strip&quot; instead and also had the added expense of a taxi as once again the shuttle had broken down.This happened a few times throughout our stay and given the location,it's quite a trek to the strip.They won't change more than $100 a day in travellers cheques,which is really annoying as it meant I had to carry my passport around with me as I.D.And if you fancy entering the weekly karaoke to win the cash prize,don't bother.The locals come in every Friday,sing a few songs and WIN???(thats how it seemed to us anyway).On the plus side however,the pool area is nice and relaxing,the rooms are a good size and the maids are very pleasant.Going back to Vegas this year but booked a hotel on the strip so we're right in the middle of the action.	
Mar 11 2005	Slow and unorganized	As far as the price goes, this place is decent for a Saturday night. As far as the service goes, it -----. The check in time was 3:00 pm. I booked 2 rooms and only one was ready, they said to wait and the other room would be ready in a few minutes. The few minutes turned into 20 minutes and when I called the front desk they said just a few more minutes. After waiting over one hour, the other room was finally ready. We get to the rooms and one of them has a broken door and both had a musky feeling to the rooms. Make sure you're drunk by the time you get back to your room so that you won't realize what a dump your staying at.	
Mar 9 2005	Big room..little price...wonderful staff	We stayed for 4 days in Dec 2004, VERY freindly staff!!!, Rooms were HUGE, They need to update the TV-, You can't be in bed and see the tv- too old, and too small- and the location in the room is not great. The Pool area is nice - but it was cold- we were told it was heated--NOT!! But the spa was great!! It would be a great NON-gambling family place.. at night I was impressed with the security guard walking around checkin on cars- ( the parking lot is dark. I have to say over all it was nice- and great PRICE!! I have stayed in the mirage and Venetian and I was treated NICER her than either one of those=AND the BIG BOUNUS-- The have a 4 star dining cafe- the staff was the BEST IN VEGAS. and the deal for the food was AWESOME- My husband is a very picky eater and well, needless to say- he won't eat in a buffett anywhere- and we were so happy with the food and service we ate there every meal... and managed to still have money left- unlike ALL the other places in vegas. Older NOn- flashy place but at least I didn't charged for all the glitz- It was CLEAN and NICE. WoULD STAY THERE AGAIN !!!	
Mar 4 2005	A bit faded but......	Stayed 7 nights 22 Feb - 1 Mar 2005. First impressions were not too favourable but we warmed to this hotel very quickly. Rooms were huge - we had 2 Queen beds - and well equipped (TV,aircon/heating system, fridge and coffee maker). Hot water/shower brilliant, food excellent and good value, towels changed daily, sun terrace and swimming pool (with hot tub) very convenient, small shop immediately outside front door serving all daily needs, (hairdresser too if required), staff very friendly and helpful, convenient for monorail, at least 100 parking spaces should you wish to rent a car. OK the neighbours were noisy (that's not the hotel's fault) but one call to Front Desk at 0330 produced immediate response and it didn't happen again. A big plus for us was, having accidentally charged us twice for one meal (which we hadn't noticed when the final bill was presented) they re-credited us within 24 hours - a pleasant surprise on the bank statement. All in all, at £26 per night, excellent value. We wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.	
Feb 21 2005	great hotel at a great price	Hugh roon. Great food. Loose slots ( I actually took money home). Beutiful pool. Overly friendly staff always willing to help. Funny van driver told us all about Las Vegas. Could not have picked a better hotel.	
Feb 19 2005	wasn't bad at all	We just got back from Vegas last week..Feb.16th...stayed at the Mardi Gras for 3 nites. The rooms were clean, just average..price was good and only 2 blocks away from the Monorail, which saved us a lot of money getting around. The restaurant there was good, large portions...breakfast was really good..hope this helped everyone. Linda	
Dec 27 2004	Good value for money	The hotel was basic, ie no frills, but clean. The staff were helpful. The restaurant was good, the food was reasonably priced and waitresses were friendly.A pity the hotel wasn't closer to &quot;the Strip&quot;, but the courtesy shuttle bus was very convenient. A good hotel for a family vacation.	
Nov 28 2004	Up to expectations.	The staff was especially friendly. The room was very spacious and well designed. Most of the fixtures were new or well maintained.Bathroom was above average. Landscaping was nice. Large courtyard and pool/spa. Las Vegas monorail is still not running/broken, so rent a car.	
Nov 23 2004	Never treated so terribly in my life	Not only did we reserve 5 rooms 2 months in advance, but we also called the day before to re-confirm...needless to say we waited 45 minutes at the check in desk...all to hear that they had no record of our reservations! It was VERY late and there were 11 of us (including a small child) so we waited. Luckily, they had rooms available. One of the rooms that they gave us was occupied, and another one was never cleaned from the last guests. When we finally got to our room. It smelled heavily of urine and beer (this was NOT the room that wasn't cleaned) I dropped something on the floor, and that's when I almost fainted at the smell of urine. When I walked into the bathroom, I noticed some unexpected guests, there were 3 cockroaches on the floor, 1 dead, 2 alive. I called my mom in another room, she too had a cockroach in her room. I was disgusted. I called the front desk and was told that this is common in Las Vegas and shouldn't worry about it. Being that I had never been there before, I shrugged it off. The last straw I had was when the waitress in the &quot;restaurant&quot; rolled her eyes at me when I asked her if she was going to wait on us after sitting there for 15 minutes, and told me to &quot;just give me your order, ok?&quot;. So I asked to speak to the manager to tell him that we were checking out early, and was told that was fine, but we were still going to pay for the 3 nights that were reserved. I questioned him by saying that I was told that we had no reservation, according to his staff the night before...he laughed and said that it didn't matter, we still had to pay in full for the nights reserved. I couldn't believe the rude, unthoughtful service we received. I don't recommend staying there.	
Nov 12 2004	Good for the price	If you are looking for a resonable price place to sleep this is a good place. Not fancy, just a plain room but very roomy, clean and comfortable. The restaurant's food was good and resonably priced. Service was a bit slow but friendly. Their little casino was a nice place to play a few slots. I even won a few dollars. Their desk clerks were a little unknowledgable and didn't want to go out of their way but fairly effecient. Overall, it served our purpose nicely.	
Nov 12 2004	Great value	Not the newest or the smartest, but if you're on a budget, this could be the one for you. The 'mini-suite' was clean and spacious with a wonderfully comfortable bed. The pool was clean and tidy. The desk staff were exremely helpful when I presented them with a minor personal crisis, which they managed to resolve with a little internet detective work. The shuttle to the stip/airport runs every hour on a complimentary basis (tips are in order of course) but my advice is to invest in a $5 day pass for the bus service (108 connects with the stip near the Stratosphere) My one reservation was that the Hotel's own Restautrant was too close to the noise of the inevitable slot machines. If I go back to Las Vegas I would certainly use this Hotel again.	
Sep 21 2004	2002WEDDING	We are staying her 12 days in 2002 for our Las Vegas Wedding. ABSOLUTLY PERFECT....Room clean, Services excellent, etc...We are come back last year and we come come back again in December...Thanks	
Sep 8 2004	Don't waste your time or money here	Save your money stay somewhere else. Our stay was the week of May 10, 2004. The rooms were dingy, they had bugs in the rooms, the staff seem like we were imposing on them, the &quot;casino&quot; is two rows of slot machines, the big feature of the hotel was the pool, but in talking to the staff in the days before checking in no one mentioned that it was being resurfaced and was closed. We had 3 rooms with adults and children with us for a wedding and we requested that the rooms be reserved near each other, we got 1 by the front elevator{small box}, 1 at the rear courtyard and 1 outside the courtyard opposite of the construction site, not real close to each other. The shuttle bus leaves around 8 in the morning and you better be back by the last run around 10. As for being 2 blocks off the strip, i can see the two blocks to the strip, you just can't get there. If you plan on walking to the strip its more like 4-5 long city blocks or about 20-25 minute walk. If you do plan to stay here i highly recomend getting the safe and use it. The Place would be good if your going and don't care where you sleep and are just going to party, but anyone traveling with a family should steer clear of this place. The best part of staying here was leaving as early as possible.	
Aug 12 2004	Good place to get some rest	The hotel is a little of the strip, but close to the monorail. My room was very large and had a fride. Nice and cool when it's 108 degrees outside.Although the neigbourhood is not very friendly I found the Mardi gras excellent to get some sleep after gambling in the casino's.I stayed here on july 26 for 2 nights.	
Jul 15 2004	An Off-Strip Gem!	The ad took a little liberty saying the hotel was located &quot;two blocks from the strip.&quot; As the crow flies, yes, but one-way streets and construction make it a tad longer to drive, and even longer to walk. However, this is probably the best little find in Vegas or anywhere else in the &quot;motel&quot; world. They were definitely not fibbing one bit about the comfortable and clean mini-suite room. You open the door to nice little parlor with a pull-out sofa. The queen size (in our case) bed is separated from the parlor by an attractive divider, and the wet bar is complete with a fridge, sink and coffee maker. Closet was equipped with an iron and ironing board as well; and, by motel standards, the towels were unusually generous and fluffy. One thing I don't like but which seems to be rather standard in econo-priced accommodations is the split bathroom setup, i.e., toilet &amp; tub &quot;water closet&quot; style and hand-washing sink out in the open. Not quite private enough for me when the window to the street is directly across the room. Nevertheless, the friendly staff, inviting pool, and small but pleasant casino/restaurant/bar make the Best Western Mardi Gras a great value for the budget-minded traveler.	
Jun 29 2004	Health Department Problems w/Pool	Went to spend a weekend away from the house and decided to stay at the Best Western Mardi Gras. When we arrived we were disappointed to find out that the pool was being re-surfaced and was closed. Unfortunately, we were not allowed to cancel our reservation without penalty. So, we stayed. Corporate and local management failed to provide any consideration for the lack of the pool, even though the pool was advertized. Then we discovered that Clark County Health Department had cited the Best Western Mardi Gras and closed its pool. So, you have to ask, if the pool fails the health department test, what about the restraurants?I have found that Best Western Mardi Gras is a good deal only if you are planning on slumming.	
May 19 2004	Viva Las Vegas!	We went the weekend of the Tarver-Jones fight and although the hotel is a 2-star, 3-at best, we gave it a 5-star, excellent rating and here's why. #1--the staff. The staff was courteous, helpful, and friendly. #2--location. Just a few minutes from the Strip. The hotel is on Paradise Road and if you want to beat the traffic on the Strip, Paradise Road is the street to take. Also, it's conveniently located down the street from the Wet N' Wild, water park for families who want fun in the sun. #3--little cafe in the hotel. All you can eat ribs for 11 bucks! We didn't eat there for the ribs but had breakfast there and was very satisfied. #4--pool and jacuzi were clean and crowded at some times. Finally, the rooms--although they were not spotless, the rooms were decent and for the price (less than a 100 bucks per night for a weekend) you can't beat it. Besides, for folks on a budget, this room is great for crashing after a fun day and night and taking a shower or two. The beds aren't that great either. OVERALL, STAY THERE IF YOU'RE ON A BUDGET AND LOOKING FOR A DECENT PLACE TO STAY 1-2 NIGHTS.	
May 8 2004	been to blackpool? this is luxury	We stayed at this hotel in April, we were a little worried after the reading the reviews, but our holiday was fantastic, the hotel has had some very bad press on this site, which I am about to put right!!! The hotel was very clean, very comfortable and very cheap. The food and drink was very nice and reasonable compared to the strip. Getting to the strip was made very easy by the handy little bus every hour, even without the bus a cab is only around $8. The little casino inside has everything the large casinos have, except obviously really huge pay outs!!! or a theme... The pool is clean and well kept and most of the hotel staff were very friendly and accomodating... so like I said in the subject, if you have ever stayed in a Blackpool B&amp;B you will love this palce it's great and if we had stayed out on the strip we would have been broke in 5 minutes.Obviously this hotel is not the flashiest or most glam hotle in Vegas, but atleast you can find your room with ease and get a good nights sleep in a nice air conditioned, basic but clean room.THUMBS UP TO THE MARDI GRAS!! ! I'd go back anyday.	
May 3 2004	found it to be a nice room clean and staff was fine.	We spent two nights here in late April. Had read all of the reviews but since I had booked this same hotel for a convention in the fall that my sister and I planned to attend wanted to check it out since I was traveling with my husband. Was very glad to find the price was good and room was clean. No noise problems. Food in restaurant was good. They gave us two free breakfast coupons, and one dinner free with purchase of one. Food was very good and staff friendly, especially the waiters we had. Large room. Only thing I would like to change is to have microwave in room, and have tv in front of bed. Was located in front of couch but hard to see if watching news, etc. after retiring at nite. Will stay with my reservation in the fall. Off the strip but ok. Will have monorail system they say in the fall so that will help with getting to the strip.	
Apr 22 2004	Great Time	7-21 April 2004.We arrived after having read the other reviews on this hotel, and were dreading it. What a lot of nitpickers is all I can say. The room was visited by the housekeepers every day, and kept spotless. The coffee supply was kept going throughout the fortnight.We had a full size ironing board and iron, full size fridge, cable tv and nintendo games to play. Mickey, behind the bar is a nice man full of info and very friendly, as were all the staff. The shuttle drivers were prepared to take you anywhere (within reason)! The only downside was that the roads leading to the strip were being dug up, but it was quite a pleasant 20-25 min walk in sunshine. A very friendly and welcoming place to stay and we will definitely be back, so to the nail lady of the shuttle bus, keep your eyes open for us!!!l	
Mar 27 2004	good place to stay	My husband and I recently stayed at the mardi gras. We were there from March 19-22 2004. We enjoyed our stay. The rooms are nice. Although we had a non-smoking room. When the towels got wet they smelled like smoke. The pool was nice. Wasn't noise. The restrauant had good food. The staff behind the counter could have been a little more friendly, but altogether we had a GREAT stay. I'd stay there again. It wasn't that far off the strip either.	
Mar 21 2004	Mediocre Motel	This hotel is exactly average, and for the pricing you can definately find a hotel on the strip that has the whole Las Vegas experience. It was fairly clean, and very large. The lobby has a &quot;few&quot; slot machines and a bar/restaraunt that was small but really fun. You can get a free continental breakfast (below average) for free, or use their coupon to get a hot breakfast in the bar. The hotel staff I found to be not very friendly but average competent. It wasn't bad, but for the price I'd go for the strip first.	
Feb 18 2004	Horrible experience	We arrived at the Best Western on Thursday Feb 12 and were told that our reservation was for Feb 11 and since we were a no show our reservations were cancelled. We made our reservation in September at the local hotel not the 800 number to receive special senior pricing. We received a reservation number and reconfirmed the first week of February. Even though we had a local confirmation number, we were told that the reservation was made through the 800 number. We were offered a &quot;walk-in&quot; rate for Thurs &amp; Friday but no room for Sat &amp; Sun. No attempt was made to find us a room. I walked to the Embassy Suites and although they had no room available, they called around and secured a hotel for us for 4 days. The hotel was located two blocks from Bally's and a wonderful find.	
Jan 29 2004	Stay on the strip	Basic rooms, but the location is poor. best just stay on the strip, even in a motel.	
Jan 27 2004	great place to stay	After reading these reviews i was dreading going to the mardi gras. To add to the disapointment of being moved from the strip because of the convention we were told we were going to this place. I myself found it very friendly, the staff were great and really made a big fuss of us, the drivers of the bus (we had 2) were very nice offering to take us to any hotel we wanted, even though there route is just to the airport or ballys, they even took us to the rio to see penn and teller after they heard us discuss it in the bar!!Our room was huge with 2 queen sized beds, and although i agree that this isnt the best kept best western, i cannot blame the staff. they kept our room spotless and never came to the door if the do not disturb sign was out. The overall state of the place is a bit run down but the staff do their utmost to keep it clean. If best western spent a bit of money and gave them something to work with then this place would be great.If you want a great hotel then my advice is to pay the money and book one, but from my experience not all the strip hotels are fab!A great place to stay, clean friendly and very helpful, if a little off the beaten track, but that really didnt prove a problem	
Dec 22 2003	Outstanding !	I thought the Mardi Gras was quite good actually. For some reason we just got the nicest cleanest and most comfortable room! The driver really is extremely nice, he is quite a pleasant gentleman. While we stayed one night, we will surely return. As a hotel worker in Key West, I will give the informed opinion that this was a just fine place to stay	
Dec 15 2003	Look elsewhere	The first day was pretty nice I had a restful sleep. The next day everything went down hill. I take it that the management had a bad day. I would look elsewhere next time I visit Vegas.
