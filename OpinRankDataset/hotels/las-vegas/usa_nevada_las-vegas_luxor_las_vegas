	Loved Vegas	I liked our hotel they had finished renovating part of the hotel and upgraded our room for $20 since it was down season. I liked the hotel but found it really far down the strip from the shopping area but I would stay there again. It was clean and the staff was nice!!!	
	If not for the concert package...	We stayed here because they were offering a Stevie Wonder (MGM) concert/2 night minimum stay package. The tickets weren't too shabby and the concert was great. The Luxor needs a good steam cleaning. I think it can be saved, but overall, I wouldn't stay there again. The pyramid room had finger prints all over the windows. If you have pyramid rooms, you really need to keep up with the windows. I mean they were so obvious. They need new management. And when we checked in of course they had no king size beds under the package price we got, so they tried to get us to &quot;upgrade&quot;= more money. We agreed for one night and then went back to a standard room the next. it wasn't about the money, it was about the principle. The standard room in the pyramid was &quot;nicer&quot; than the tower room. The workers kept telling us the opposite. The actually cleanliness of the room or lack there of had a downtown Vegas feel instead of &quot;the Strip&quot;. After you finish paying the resort fee, the upgrade (if you want a king bed) and taxes, the rooms aren't as cheap(in cost) as they seem. I would definitely just pay 20 or 30 bucks extra and stay somewhere else. Next time I'll go with the ticket deals the MGM is handing out instead of the Luxor, for sure.	
	Dirty Trick!	I just wanted to say that this was a pretty dirty trick! We signed up for the guaranteed low rate thinking we would have a &quot;decent&quot; room. When we got there, we were asked if we wanted to &quot;upgrade to a &quot;higher level room&quot; we said no. We researched and knew that the rate we paid was within our budget and we were sticking to a budget. So.... you stuck us on the 4th floor - first we walked forever to the elavator then once on the 4th floor we walked past 50 - 60 (?) rooms just to get to ours. Then when we arrived we found our room to be over the filthy loud air vent from the restaurant (?) we could not even talk/hear each other in the hall as we tried to open the door. Once in the room, we found that we were to be looking out the window to a block wall. The carpets were awful - stained and dirty. It looked as if someone had already used the bathroom (probably the couple ahead of us who went to the room and walked out?). We went back to registration and paid the extra $20.00 flippin per night to be upgraded to the 9th floor. Why did you not just say on your web site that if you want crap here is the low rate. If you want decent you will pay $20.00 above the crappy room rate. Once we were on the 9th floor the room was great. However, the registration experence and the walk to and from the 4th floor room had left a bad taste in my mouth. I refused to spend any money in the hotel. We walked down the strip to gamble and eat. On a good note - the Titanic Exhibit was wonderful!	
	Watch out for old rooms	We booked the room using our Amex points. When we checked in we were given a room in the old wing of the hotel. The room was terrible - stained carpet, bathroom not cleaned properly and a peculiar smell in the hallway and the room. When I called to complain that this was not a 4 star quality room, the manager said that the ratings on the website were not their responsible and were recorded by the websites. Did she agree then that their hotel should not be a 4 star rating? We were given a room in a another wing, which was marginally better. Overall our experience left much to be desired. I would not stay at Luxor again.	
	A once great hotel left to decay.	This hotel is large like most Vegas hotels with all the amenities but has not been maintained in years it seems. The carpet in the hallway to our room was bunching up so bad you could almost trip over the wrinkles, the rips where just covered with tape. The room was musty and old. The carpet and walls dirty with stains. The maid service was good but the towels where old and felt like sand paper. To make things worse the pool was closed for the season even though other hotels had there pools open. The location at the end of the strip is good if you like to be away from the action but New York hotel is nearby and would seem a better choice.	
	Outdated - Dirty - Poor Service - Nickel 	Have been to Vegas several times, but never stayed at the Luxor, however I did know it was not a 4 or 5 star hotel going into my stay. We stayed their because the novelty of the hotel itself (pyramid shape) and the fact one of the 3 shows we saw was at this hotel (Chris Angel). As noted in the title - the hotel is old and dated and shows every bit of it - period. Inside, the walkways and hallways are dark and dirty. The ceilings have visual water leak spots, peeling wall paper and an 80's look and smell that goes along with it. The rooms again, are in need of a rehab. The curtains are old, the carpet is filthy, the beds are flimsy, the bathroom is dark, the towels are (all 3 the provide) are in need of replacing and just overall I felt like I was in an old 8-days Inn. The staff was inattentive, house keeping was provided only once a day and the hotel charged you for everything you could think of. If you need internet access - 14.99 a day (no wireless). A daily paper - 12.49 per day. Need to print a boarding pass at the business center - 1.00 PER MINUTE + cost of paper. I do not mind paying for services, however at the quality and level the Luxor provided - they should be paying their guests. There are so, so many other options available for staying on the Vegas strip - and the Luxor is NOT one of them. You will be very disappointed with your stay - as you can read by the other reveiwers here.	
	Great location...	We got a really great price on travelocity when my husband and I went to Las Vegas this past March for our wedding. The location of The Luxor was great - on the south side of the strip. It was a convenient location, close to the hustle and bustle of the strip but far enough to not have to hear it. The rooms were clean and pretty updated. The hotel itself wasn't too noisy, especially considering its size. The casino wasn't too bad either ; ) We went to see Criss Angel while we were there and the line for tickets was relatively short. Nothing negative to say about the hotel at all. I would definitely stay again.	
	Stunning Hotel- fun and lively.	Have always wanted to stay at this hotel, having been interested in Egypt since I was a child and I am glad I made it - rumours abound that this Hotel may abandon it's theme or even close- not sure if this is true. Visually, the hotel is stunning comprising of the main pyramid shaped atrium building containing all the amenities and rooms all the way around up to the top, and a couple of blocks with other rooms. It is bigger inside than it looks- we stayed on the 23rd floor and had a lovely view looking out to the mountains. My friend had booked online- beware of extra charges- tax is added to everything in the states, and there is a resort fee of £10.95 per day for newspapers and bottled water and unlimited phone calls within the U.S.A.-not much use to us, although we were glad of the water! the approximate cost of our 5 night stay worked out at $35 each per night which I think is acceptable ,especially compared to U.K. prices- this is for room only. The room had a subtle Egyptian theme, lovely big beds and enough storage space for the two of us= take some extra hangers,only 10 provided. The bathroom was shower only, fixed, so you had to wash your hair whilst you were showering-plenty of towels and facecloths and little bottles of toiletries were provided and replaced,there was also a hairdryer and spare socket for shavers/hair straighteners and other sockets in the room. Word of warning- there was an alarm clock in our room which was fixed, it had been set for 5.30 am and neither me or my friend could work out how to change the settings so I was woken at that time every morning ,no matter what I tried ! Check this when you arrive so you don't receive a rude awakening. The rooms have smoking or non smoking options- Las Vegas is a haven for smokers as you are allowed to smoke in the casino areas of the hotels,and in bars which do not serve food and you can also smoke outside,ashtrays are dotted around everywhere. As the main building houses the casino ,the cigarette smoke does filter through into the public areas so if you are a non-smoker, you may not like this aspect. Another thing due to the atrium design is the noise level- you can sometimes hear music and loudspeakers filtering up to your room and this can go on until quite late- we armed ourselves with sleeping tablets and earplugs and we were fine! Inside the main building are Egyptian statues and pyramid buildings (no photography is allowed in public casino/hotel areas unfortunately) There is a great selection of restaurants ,a food court, a nightcub and lively bars,24 hour shops and a great buffet, all you can eat for a fixed price- breakfast $15 or an all day ticket for $29. The hotel had a good location in between the Mandalay Bay hotel and the Excalibur- all accessible by tram from 11am or moving walkways or escalators- or if you exit at the front, you can get a taxi or walk down the strip to reach all the other hotels,casinos and shops. The thing I liked the least about being able to walk through from building to building is that they are dimly lit and you can spend hours in twlilight due to the lack of windows- it was getting dark by 5pm so you may have a whole day there without even seeing daylight! My friend who travels to Vegas quite often said that the strip was so long that you had to get taxis to get around, but I found that for me this was untrue- I don't mind walking and I prefer to be outside in the fresh air. perhaps the distances might be a struggle for someone in a wheelchair or people with small children, but you do get the great photo opportunites by walking along the strip. I found that getting taxis everywhere was an unecessary expense- you are expected to tip everybody and the taxis are on a meter so fares can be dearer than you think. Shop around if you are going to do any tours, and the Luxor offers special packages and discounts for it's guests for shows and exibitions like the Titanic exhibit, the CSI experience and Criss Angel. The hotels also offer a Players club reward scheme, you receive a card which you insert into the slots- the more you gamble, the more points you accumulate- you can use these in machines for all hotels in the group. My friend has one of these cards and we were able to redeem money off our room stay- leave your credit card open at the front desk on the day you check in. Handy tips for Vegas in general- drinks prices are expensive and often prices are not displayed anywhere, even in shops! You can get a shock if you order cocktails with dinner- we got charged $24 for 2 drinks and don't forget the price you see is not what you pay- 8% tax is added and then the tip or gratuity rate is between 10-15% on top of that. The cheapest option if you fancy a drink is to play the slot machines- cocktail waitresses come round, you order your drink and tip them $2 per drink,as long as you are playing you can order your drinks for the price of a tip and get nicely merry and if you are lucky, you may win a few dollars too! Outside the Hotel are some boxes with free leaflets and discount books for Vegas, you can also pick these up in the taxis- try to get some of these as soon as you get there to give you some ideas on where to go. I would recommend a minimum stay of 1 week- we went for 5 days and packed a lot in but still didn;t get to do everything we wanted- I would recommend that if you want to see the Grand Canyon, book this on the day you arrive for the following day- you will find it easy to get up for the early start before you adjust to Vegas time. We did the West rim trip as it is nearest- do not eat at the Ranch as the food is terrible- there are two other options on this tour for meals. Take sunglasses and a jacket or hoodie as it was chilly when we went. The skywalk is extra- approx $35 and helicopter trips are around $250 extra. We had a great time and I hope these tips have helped you !	
	Excellent hotel	The pyramid was the most awesome experience. The &quot;Inclinators&quot; are an experience every one should try at least once. The decor is awesome and the clubs and restaurants are 5 star. The shopping is wonderful, especially if you are into Egyptian art and artifacts.	
	Beds fit for a mummy!	There are a lot of hotel in Las Vegas all vying for your dollar. There are many bargains to be found. Even in the luxury hotels.I would not call the Luxor a luxury hotel, but the rooms are OK. The beds, however, need a MAJOR fix. They are hard and hardly luxurious. It was not a comfortable night's sleep. The television also need an upgrade, to HD flat screens.The amenities are all fine, no complaints here. I ate at the buffet for one dinner, and while there were plenty of selections, the buffet doesn't offer the same amount of entree selections as the Mandalay Bay next door. But it's also less expensive.I have stayed at the Luxor several times for business; managed to get a little play-time in at the tables.The Luxor is not on the level of the Manadaly, which flanks it on one side, but is definitely a huge step up from the Excalibur which flanks it on the other side.	
	Excellent much better than previous reviews suggested	First time in Las Vegas, and decided on the Luxor. However reviews leading upto us going on 10th November 2009, were not favourable. I raised my concerns direct with the hotel and was offered a free upgrade to one the tower rooms. We were given room 11341 in the East Tower. The room was huge, two massive kingsize beds and huge shower that could fit 5 people in, as well as a massive bath.The room was clean, great views out the front of the hotel. I would definately stay in the Luxor again and would recommend this to my friends.We ate the in the restaurant in the hotel and the food was very good. The walk between in Mandalay Bay and the Excalibur was good, the hotel are massive in Las Vegas.	
	Beware of cheap rooms and value books with hidden costs	We booked our stay as a package deal through U.S.airlines. It offered $80 worth of comps and coupon books. We took advantage of every bonus we could. It was a good thing, as when we checked out we were stuck with a $76 charge ( a resort fee). It is charge per day for use of the pool and gym. The pool is only open seasonally so it was closed and we never used the gym. One plus was service, we were upgraded to a tower room because we needed ajoining rooms at no additional cost. The tower felt a bit isolated from the rest of the resort. In fact we never even walked around the hotel really, as it was such a walk from the tower. It was closer to walk across the street to Excalibur. It's a hotel that is REALLY far down the strip. Luckily we rented a car and were able drive to the center of the strip.My recommendation is to stay somewhere more centrally located, unless the Luxor is your intended destination. Don't stay here for the cheap price as it ends up costing the same with all if the hidden costs.	
Nov 25 2009 	Home of Criss Angel!	I totally understand why the Mindfreak lives there. It's situated perfectly and we didn't even leave the hotel for our entire first day there was so much to do! I want to stay there again and again!	
Nov 25 2009 	amazing place	we visited las vegas in october, and found the luxor to be an amazing place to stay. we had a strip view pyramid room, with an amazing view of the airport, on the 16th floor. The Titanic show in the Luxor is something not to be missed. The Luxor is at one end of the strip, but you know this before you fly - and it is only $7 for a 24hr Deuce bus pass which allows you unlimited trips so it is incredibly easy to go from the nearby mall to downtown fremont street and all the hotels on the strip in between. the food buffet in the luxor is worth the all day buffet price of $30 dollars which includes all your food and soft drinks for the day. Shame they are starting to lose the Egypt theme, which is weird seeing as the hotel's main attraction is that it's a pyramid, which funnily enough is Egyptian, but hey, we'll take a look at the finished article when we return. Our main reason for the visit was to get married, which again, we would recommend to anyone - a very romantic day if you want it to be, with gondola rides at the Venetian, and trips up the Eiffel tower at the Paris, and of course the wonderful Bellagio fountains....... and yes, we will be goign back.	
Nov 23 2009 	HOLY SMOKE !!!	Coming from Canada, I was absolutely apalled by the smoky atmosphere of this hotel! From the moment you walk in, it harken you back to the days of being z kid of the 70's with smoke wafting through the air no matter where you hide. Wouldn't stay here again solely for this fact. Service was fine, portions crazy big., What a waste!	
Nov 23 2009 	felt sooo dirty	1. trying to get to the room? how about having to walk two sides of the casino to get to my room? after walking the strip, the last thing anyone should have to do is walk two walls to get to their room.2. looking over the casino, one can see all the dirt on top of the statues inside the bldg. gross!3. walls are paper thin..could hear what was going on all around me!4. taking a shower? drain didnt work properly and by the end of the shower there i am in 1 inch of water.would i stay at this hotel again? even for free!? N-O	
Nov 23 2009 	Better than expected	We stayed at the Luxor for 3 nights in their most basic room on the 5th floor. I was worried it would be a little noisy since we were in the pyramid section of the hotel but was pleasantly surprised by how quiet it was. Room was basic and good for what we needed--- a place to sleep. Service was standard- nothing over and above. In previous stays in Vegas, I never really made it south of NYNY so staying at the Luxor was nice. The best thing about the casino-- not as smoke filled as other casinos.	
Nov 22 2009 	Fantastic value	Second time this year we have stayed at the Luxor and again, the staff could not do enough for us. We found the room to be very clean, every day we stayed there, we had no complaints and were given a late check-out with no hassles or cost. Location is in the quieter end of the Strip, but we love walking, so walked every day. All in all a terrific escape.	
Nov 21 2009 	Super Bowl	I stay here often and I usually get good service. I have only had one of about ten trips where the room we were in had plumbing issues and no dsl cable so it was an inconvenience but usually without the kiddies it is fine.	
Nov 21 2009 	Dated Decor wished we had stayed somewhere else	We booked the Spa suite as we were getting married in Vegas, lots of people had told us nice things about the Luxor so we were confident in our choice. We were so dissapointed the room was tierd and dated, the bed lined was bitty and well used as were the towels. the lifts were shabby and it was very noisy. Freinds and family had got better deals in better hotels and we were dissapointed as we were after a bit of luxury. Very basic hotel rooms, walking through the casino it smelt like a greasy spoon cafe, we had breakfast one morning there and it was not cheap, went the Mandalan Bay for breakfast which was a lovely experience and a lot cheaper!! The Room service in Luxor even charged us for ordering glasses with wine $4.50 each!! Its ok if you get good room rates and you are on a budget break and dont care about the room - good location to the strip.	
Nov 20 2009 	Beautiful looking Hotel......rooms not so much.....sketchy area after dark.	Stayed one night only. This hotel has a breathtaking interior entertainment area. Great exhibits and shows here, food great too. Its definitely well worth coming in to have a look and take some things in.The room was horrible. Bedcovers stained and looking pre-1978. Small and dated room. Even though our room was quite expensive, it had absolutely no view of anything. Very long walk to everything. In the evening, checked out the strip on the walkways to/from the inside of the Luxor. Very sketchy travelling through here. No security anywhere along the walkway and all sorts of people were wandering around. Oh yes, and while leaving in the morning, several cars in the parking area had their car alarms going off. Some were going for a long time evidently, sounded like batterys were dying. One car had its windows smashed out, glass everywhere .........no security whatsoever...... Hope you have insurance.Good for entertainment and sightseeing, bad for accomodations and creepy travelways.	
Nov 20 2009 	Glad we stayed	arrived 8am from airport, room available straight away. Pyramid spa suite (3 females) was awesome. Very roomy, big bathroom, seperate living room, seperate jacuzzi next to tinted window with views over mountains at the back of the strip. If you stay pay a few extra $ and have a spa room! Jacuzzi is amazing after a long day trekking up the strip. Corridors bit shabby but impressed by the (4 corner) lifts that move diagonally upward. Foyer quite impressive (if not a little dated) lots going on, and till all hours (macs at 4am!) but froogle on the free casino drinks! (Go Mandalay Bay instead!). Pool area looks good from a distance, but was a bit shabby and a bit (dare I say it) Chavvy, with gangs of people (mainly youths) drinking in the pool. Overall pleased we tried this place out, but also got similar (slighty cheaper) rate at Bellagio and MGM Signature Suites (not MGM Grand) and this place paled in comparison to those!	
Nov 20 2009 	Good Holiday	We stayed at this hotel 6 years ago so we went with it again, then read some of the comments and our hearts sank. Check in took 10 mins tops we do not have a credit card so didn't pay the $15 a day charge we left all the papers neatly stacked and un read, we had a room in the pyramid very easy to find it was clean towels changed daily and the bedding was changed. Yes the hotel is looking tired but if you use the room to sleep what does it matter if it needs a lick of paint. We also never had anything but politeness from any staff members as for the time share touts they are in all hotels evan Caesars Palace. It is a good walk from here to Caesars, Venation, Belagio ect but that is half the fun.My advice to any one who has this hotel booked is go with a open mind, the company we booked through didn't rate it as a 5 star but 3 so we got better than we expected, would I stay here again yes I would.	
Nov 19 2009	Do not even consider it!!!	This hotel is appalling. No standard what so ever. Most of us come from homes of a much better and cleaner quality. Stayed here for three nights recently and was appalled at the lack of standards in every way. I booked a room with a bath and when I arrived a young lady tried to charge me another 69 dollars for the privilege of a bath as opposed to a shower. They seem to work on the principle of offering you sub standard accommodation and when you naturally reject it they offer you better but charge you extra. The hotel is jaded and old. Housekeeping seem overworked and considering what they have to work with do quiet a good job but they cannot make the hotel into something it is not, namely a good quality accommodation Do yourself a favor and find another hotel. This place seems to target &quot;the great unwashed&quot; .	
Nov 19 2009 	The Suxor	My first time ever in Vegas and we're staying at this kitschy hotel shaped like a pyramid. I was jacked. Then we got there. To start with the people at the hotel desk were, at best, rude. Yes, the lobby is opulent and the casino is rocking, but the wait to check-in is forever, and then we get a room in the west tower and it's just about Motel 6 quality. Seriously, the most basic of hotel rooms - dirty carpets, beds made of straw from the Egyptian era, no desk, no coffee maker, the $15 Internet connection didn't work, and to top it off the people next door to me were doin' the do in a loud way the next morning at 8 am and the onion paper-thin walls did nothing to conceal their great passion. What happens is Vegas can stay in Vegas if it's at the Luxor. If I ever go back to Sin City I will absolutely stay somewhere else. This place is pretty much a hole with a casino in it. It sux big time. Stay away.	
Nov 19 2009 	Just Unbelievable	We had a spa suite and the suite was huge, the size of a apartment. Service ,meals etc top class. People are so friendley.	
Nov 19 2009 	Staying in a pyramid	It was a nice stay... the rooms are nice but there was no view outside... (Jsut some junk) They did an outstanding job in the lobby and it is connected to 2 other great hotels... Mandilay bay and Excaliber. The buffet in the luxor was great ad a steal for 30.00 / all day. There is also a free tram stop right out front that goes to a bunch of other hotels on the strip. 	
Nov 18 2009 	A really unique Las Vegas landmark!!!	I have been to the Luxor a number of years ago and was surprised to find out that Luxor is still one of the best hotels on the strip. It was elegant inside, very helpful staff, good variety of restaurants and all in all still very luxurious and classy. It was also convenient that you can go to either Mandalay Bay or Excalibur without even going out on the streets. Definitely will stay there again!!!	
Nov 18 2009 	beautiful luxor	i am so happy with our stay here. our room was excellent!	
Nov 18 2009 	Last Stay at the Luxor	Rooms were outdated and not the cleanest. They recently renovated the tower section. Got to our room in the afternoon. wanted to take a nap and was ready to fall asleep when all of a sudden music was pounding from out by the pool. it was so loud that we ended up leaving the room. Speakers are way to close to the hotel. The buffett down stairs was the most awful place I have ever eaten. Food was either cold, bland or just down right disgusting! I think I will fork out extra money to stay at the bellagio next time. 	
Nov 17 2009 	Not what we expected!	3 of my friends and I rented 2 rooms and stayed at the Luxor Hotel in Las Vegas over the weekend of November 13th. I would have to say that this hotel is not what we expected. It was very outdated, noisy and the beds were horrible, along with old bedding. The showers in both rooms leaked all over the bathroom floor, so we had to use towels to catch the running water. The room service was very expensive and the variety of late night dining was VERY limited in the Hotel/Casino. The price to stay at this hotel is absolutely not worth it, your better off to stay at the Excalibur next door for half the price. The hotel also charges a &quot;resort fee&quot; that you do not have the option to purchase, they make you pay $25.00 per night per room for access to the pools, and a newspaper and 2 bottles of water. You should have the option to pay this as in November we were not using the pools!	
Nov 17 2009 	More then a headache. Not worth the money no matter how little you spent...	Upon arriving to the Luxor we were told that all the rooms with King sized beds were sold out and that we would have to be moved to a room with 2 queen size beds. We were told that the room that we were moving to was a slight upgrade since they sold out. Ok that sounded like a good compromise...We arrive in our room which can only be described as a cave. It was dark and cold and the view out the window was of a wall so there was very little sunlight. The beds were unbelievably uncomfortable. I have slept in more comfortable beds at a motel in the middle of BFE! The next day I went to talk to the front desk and luckily the guy there felt sorry for us and moved us to a higher floor with a room that had a king bed. It was MUCH better but I still don't think that the hotel is worth the money unless you get one of those $44 per night deals. I have stayed at other hotels in Las Vegas that were much better then the Luxor and will never stay at the Luxor hotel again. The rooms are dingy and outdated. The beds are like sleeping on a concrete floor and I guess this little move they did of changing our rooms happens quite often. Also if you look at the photos they have on the web of their rooms, don't believe what you see. They are VERY misleading. If I were you I would spend the extra $20 or $30 bucks per night and go stay at the MGM or another nice hotel on the strip.	
Nov 17 2009 	Brilliant! A holiday I will always remember	Visited Vegas in late october this year for only three nights, but could have stayed for three years! hotel is a ten minute journey from th airport, infact, you can see the top of the pyramid from the landing point. Impressed by the unique layout/design of the hotel, staff were very friendly and helpful, although some idiot will always try selling you time share-but hey, thats anywhere in America. Our room was perfectly fine, very clean, great bathroom facilities/shower...lets face it, how much tim are you going to be spending in your room anyway?coridoors leading to the rooms did look quite old fashioned, mabey one of the things that need to be updated.The only thing that goes againts the hotel is where it is located, right at the beggining of the strip, which makes it difficult at times to explore.But trust me the hotel is worth staying at, I visited th Bellagio and the Mirage, which to be honest are classier, but I feel that for value the luxor is worth it.	
Nov 16 2009 	I wouldn't stay here again if it was FREE	The lobby looks nice but looks are definitely deceiving. There is a $10.99/day 'resort fee', which is ridiculous for two tiny bottles of water and a USA Today. We 'upgraded' (and I use the term loosely) to a 'spa suite' when booking months ago. The 'spa suite' is just a large room with two queen size beds and a whirlpool tub in the bedroom next to the windows. Reminded me of a tacky 70's Poconos hotel room. The room did have a sitting room with a couch (which did not pull out into a bed) but the couch hadn't been vacuumed in years; totally disgusting. When I sat on the bed, the springs pushed up through the mattress. The towels were threadbare and the pillows flat. The bathroom is tile (with mold on ceiling) but the shower base was fiberglass, which looks incredibly tacky and didn't match. I usually stay at the Bellagio, Paris, Venetian (I obviously did not choose the hotel this trip) so I know how nice a hotel can be and the Luxor sucks. The other issue I despise about this hotel is that it is too far away from everything. If you want to go shopping, great restaurants, etc, you have to take a cab, and depending on the time of day it was $12-$20 each way. Save the money on the cabfare and put it towards booking a nice hotel closer to the center of the Strip.	
Nov 16 2009 	You'd think it would be a bit nicer....	We stayed here after I spent 4 nights at the Stratosphere during a business conference. Stratosphere was $23 a night and we wanted something a bit more upscale for the weekend. We were disappointed to find out that for 4x the price, our room was badly in need of maintenance.The wallpaper was peeling off, the carpet was filthy - the beds were concave in the middle, with terrible OLD OLD matresses - a mysterious puddle of water would appear around the toilet during the day when we were gone. I complained via twitter and received 4 comped tickets to Carrot Top from Danielle - which was AWESOME - unfortunately she couldnt do anything about the room as that was a different division (hotel &amp; casino dont really work together from what I can tell.) I never received a phone call about my room complaints, even though Danielle told the hotel that I had issues with the cost and the room....The location here wasnt really any better than the Stratopshere, both were out of the way. I did win more money at the Luxor, even on the weekend, but i'd have given up the winnings to have a decent bed and clean carpet. Overall disappointed and will not go back.	
Nov 16 2009 	uncomfortable beds	Just returned from a stay at the Luxor - had a &quot;deluxe&quot; room in the East Tower. Room had definitely not been upgraded in a loooong time. Always look forward to super-comfy beds on vacation - the bed at the Luxor was a disappointment.Also, the room is very dark, even with all the lights on.	
Nov 15 2009 	This place sucks literally	Oh where do I began, this hotel is such a ripoff their lobby makes their hotel look really nice until you enter the room. The bathroom door had mildew at the bottom, the carpet was so filthy I did not want to take my shoes off, To anyone who has been to a nice hotel, beware before you enter this one. I could not see for feeling like I was in a motel not a hotel. I have stayed at venetian and ballys. Ballys does not have a great lobby but boy did I feel more comfortable in their rooms. Oh god overly disgusting to much to put in writing.Oh my I wish I would have took pictures to show how horrid it really was.	
Nov 15 2009 	Great Gambling good food Go see Carrot Top!!!	Checked in on a Tuesday just afternoon, asked nicely for any sort of upgrade available, instead of trying the $20 trick. No upgrade unless you paid the standard fee. Wanted a king size bed with a view in a Pyramid Deluxe room that (I booked on Price Line, 4* hotel at $45/noc). Not available yet, they said, so come back after 3pm. Checked luggage at Bell Desk and off we went gambling. Hubby won $2700 at first machine he sat down at! Went back to desk at 3 PM and find out the upgrade cost to a Spa Suite had come down to an extra $35/noc so we splurged! The Spa Suite is what made our trip, loved the jetted tub and the view was wonderful from the 9th floor, could see pool, mountains etc. Were facing west, no strip view but that was ok. There was to be a $10/noc resort fee which includes 2 small bottles of water and USA Today paper, but PL waived ours for us, not sure why but not complaining. Housekeeping brought 3 bottles of water daily promptly when asked, as we do not get maid service usually, personal preference. I needed a room close to elevator and got just what I needed. Ate dinner at the Tacos and Tequila restaurant, $15 for cheese enchiladas, chips and salsa were wonderful. Beer is $7 if you're not gambling. Hubby paid $16 for an average cigar. Took the Tram over to Mandalay bay, be sure to get on it when it stops and opens it's doors even though it takes you to Excalibur first, you will get to Mandalay bay! It doesn't start running till 11am mid week but there are no signs posted re this. Our room was quiet and spacious with a TV in separate sitting area, nice if hubby wants to watch TV while you sleep. The room had a few dings and dents and some stains on carpet, undermount sink in bathroom was coming unglued, that was the worst of it, it wasn't as bad as the reviews make it sound, for the PL price I was happy. Saw Carrot top, bought tix ahead of time through Luxor box office on phone, will call line very short, military and Federal employees get tix at half off, didn't have to show ID. The food court was very handy, not crowded, paid $10 for a medium cheese pizza at Little Caesers that was perfect for 2 people. Hubby got comped almost all of cost of upgrade of room, and I got comped for 2 buffet tix at Mandalay bay as they are sister casinos. We will definately go back to Luxor.	
Nov 15 2009	Not for those requiring employee competence and service	Booked a tower room for family at a buy 2 nights get one free on expedia.The check in was horrible. A long wait of 30 deep for each line and this was long after check in hours at 7pm. Finally getting to the front and with itinerary in hand, the clerk said my sister couldn't check in as her name was not on the list which said 'two adults' and it was her credit card,same name. Instead of getting them their room, they had me call expdedia and then call Luxor back. The wait was so long, they went to the bar and ordered two drinks, and yes they were gambling. They were not comped for drinks but were given a bill for 24 dollars. They still hadn't gotton into the room by this time and I would have just gone somewhere else. No bell hop to watch luggage, no lounge to wait in, no apology.They also impose a 11 dollar a night fee for resort but you can't use it past 5pm, so no access but still charged.When they were finally allowed to get checked in the room was fine along with the resort area which they used the next day. I would never have family or friends stay there again, despite the cheap rates as other hotels with old Vegas service are much better.	
Nov 15 2009 	Okay	We had a nice long weekend at the Luxor in June. It was just ok. Nothing spectacular. When we arrived in our room, it had yet to be cleaned from the previous guests. We had to go back down to the counter and complain. We were upgraded to a 'suite' but really it wasn't much of a suite. Just a larger room with a small living room and then a separate bedroom. If I was paying the suite price, I would have def been disappointed. We did like that the hotel had a few cheap restaurants for grabbing breakfast on a budget. And being able to use the tram was nice to get around.	
Nov 14 2009 	Shabby and Chic But Not in a Good Way	I was looking forward to my stay at the Luxor; the last time I was here (about ten years ago) I had enjoyed the campy, yet luxurious Egyptian theme of the rooms and public areas. Unfortunately, the kitch has been removed from most of the public areas and the luxury has faded from the rooms; in fact, I don't think the rooms have been renovated at all since I was last here. This was very apparent in the worn upholstery and sagging, uncomfortable mattress.I booked the cheapest type of room available on the Luxor Web site, the &quot;pyramid&quot; room. It was dark, shabby and stained. The bathroom, which had only a shower, no tub, was fairly nice. Both beds had worn out mattresses (add to that the fact I asked for a king but didn't get it). The table and chairs looked as if they had been stolen from a meeting room. I was in Las Vegas for a wedding and some of the other wedding guests were also at the Luxor. Every single one of them had a complaint, the most unanimous being that the rooms were dark, including the more expensive &quot;tower&quot; rooms. My theory is that the rooms are dark so you wont notice how worn they are.The amenities and public areas are much nicer than the rooms. There are a lot of swanky bars and restaurants scattered throughout the casino area; none are Egyptian themed, and all are really expensive, from $10 to $12 per drink, even more for specialties. I did not try any of the fancy restaurants here. I had poor service and poor food at the coffee shop and the buffet. There is a good New York style deli, but it isn't cheap. The pool area is very nice; the exercise area is not bad; you might as well use it because they charge you for it in the &quot;resort fee&quot; tacked onto the daily room charge. Internet access from the rooms was outrageously expensive, but there is free wireless access in the two Starbucks and some other parts of the main floor.There are many entertainment offerings at the Luxor, including Criss Angel, Carrot Top, Menopause the Musical and a topless revue. There are also two exhibits: Titanic and Bodies. The only one I saw was Bodies, which I enjoyed, but it was too expensive. There are also two nightclubs, one of which starts the evening as a restaurant.In the future I will visit the Luxor for its casino, its nightlife and its many shows and attractions. However, I don't intend to stay here again.	
Nov 14 2009 	Unwelcoming unfriendly rude and incompetent!!!	It was my second time at the Luxor. I wanted to stay there again because we had had a good experience the first time besides the fact that they had given us twice a room that wasn't made. They solved the problem very professionally...at the time...and that was in 2006.This time, we wanted to celebrate two birthdays in our family and we booked the whole trip ON THEIR WEBSITE: flight+hotel+car.The check-in procedure was truly a nightmare! Not only we didn't feel welcome but the receptionist was very cold and unfriendly.They couldn't find our reservation in the system. We asked to see the manager (Bridget) who came to the desk without greeting us. After arguing for a while, Bridget told us that she couldn't do anything unless we could show her a confirmation number. Not only it was THEIR MISTAKE but we had to prove that we had a reservation and go to the Internet booth and pay $5 to print the confirmation of our reservation made online. To crown it all, Bridget ROLLED HER EYES AT US when we left the reception desk. How rude is that???Back to the reception, Bridget took our email of confirmation and disappeared for 15 minutes. No apology whatsoever, our receptionist, not Bridget, came back and finally assigned us to a room.The whole check-in procedure took 50 minutes. We were tired from flying from the east coast and it was 11pm at night.The room is nice and it is definitely very good quality/price but the attitude of the front desk staff at the Luxor is INTOLERABLE!!!On the second day, we didn't get room service. Were we jinxed?The spa used to be open all night back in 2006. It is now from 6am to 8pm: sadly!Besides, the hotel doesn't look as glamorous as it used to and there are much better hotels right on the strip where the attention to details make all the difference.	
Nov 14 2009 	A bit dreary and stuck in the 80s	We stayed in the pyramid. Apparently the towers were refurbished in 2006, but the pyramid felt like it was stil in the 80s. The decor was a bit tired. The room was big, but no coffee making facilities. Going into the other newer casino hotels made us realise how outdated the Luxor seemed. Could have been better generally. Had to pay to use gym which seemed ridiculous.	
Nov 14 2009 	It's all about the room type	We stayed in the luxor hotel for five days in october 2009. we booked a pyramid room, knowing that these rooms are a bit &quot;tired&quot; but as they have been a bit cheaper we thought we give it a go.check in was quick and friendly. coming to the room we could see what everybody was talking about. bathroom had no bathtube just a shower and decor and interior was &quot;tired&quot; thats probably the best word to describe it.we called reception and asked for a pyramid spa suite. it was our first trip to vegas and we both celebrated our birthdays there. for another 280 dollar we could have stayed there for the entire stay. we looked at some pictures at reception and decided to spoil ourselfs. (unfortunately the broshure for sure showes a different spa suite maybe one in one of the towers)as we came into the suite we were quite disappointed as it is the same old room just with a jacuzzi next to the window.we stayed in there for one night and figured out its waisted money. so back to reception the next day and asked for the money back and our old room category.talking to the manager that time i was &quot;tricky&quot; enough to ask him if the tower rooms are newer and he got the hint and complimentary upgraded us to one of the tower rooms.coming in there we couldnt believe how lucky we are: money back and such a amazing room!everything new, very clean, view on the strip, bathtube, huge shower aand everything in gold and marble.locationwise we would highly recommend the luxor as it is still close enough to most hotels and if you wanna go further down the strip just take the duce bus . the bus goes up and down the strip and you just pay 7 dollars for a day ticket which is really worth every cent because the strip is soooooooo long.another advise is definately the breakfast buffet in the mgm. it is the best buffet we have ever seen and has the price like the other hotels.once we had breakfast in the luxor and been quite disappointed but maybe just because we could compare it to the mgm. if you go to the mandalay bay just next door you will find aswell a good selection but we would say its more a really good brunch buffet because it has a lot of warm meals.one day we made a trip to the grand canyon which is a must! unfortunately we cant remember the company we booked it with. but we booked it in the expedia office outside the flamingo hotel. saved some dollars and would really recommend them as everything was well organised and everybody was very friendly.hope we could help a bit with your decision! you will definately have a amazing time!	
Nov 13 2009 	Nice room and great time!	We were passing through on a trip from California. The room was under $100 after all the fees and taxes. The beds were okay, but the bathroom made up for anything that beds lacked. We were in the tower after being upgraded. Room had a great view. We had the breakfast buffet in the morning and it was great.	
Nov 13 2009 	funtimes	Had a blast! Stayed in a pyramid suite... enough room for the baby to go to bed and us to stay up with the lights on...can't beat a huge jacuzzi tub in the room overlooking the strip!	
Nov 13 2009 	Fun Place and a Good Value!	We got our Sunday-Wednesday night rooms here for $50 a night which was a bargain. We opted out of the upgrade to a room in the towers ($20 more) to stay in the pyramid. Check-in was quick and easy as was the self check-out (drop your key in a slot downstairs).The room was dated, as others have said, but not terrible. I think I've had much better rooms, beds, linens, etc. in Holiday Inns, Courtyards, etc. but it was okay. It did seem odd not to have a fridge or coffee maker tho. And the &quot;resort fee&quot; for two small bottles of water a day (one day they weren't even replaced) and a USA Today seems a little silly. Then there is no wireless internet. You can pay $14 a day for connected internet tho. We did try to connect to wireless and picked up a few weak signals for a fee. Be cautious...these are NOT the hotel internet signals despite being called things like &quot;Guest Services&quot; and &quot;Travelers' Net&quot;.It was really easy to walk over to Mandalay Bay or the Excalibur whenever we wanted to, and since the Luxor is at the end of the strip it was easy to catch the bus before it got crowded. The all day buffet is a really good idea if you're planning to be at the hotel for meals. Even if you just do breakfast and then dinner later, it's worth it. Or you can just run down there for a quick snack or dessert any time too. There are a LOT of selections. We also ate at the Pyramid Cafe upstairs a couple of times. The prices are a bit high, but that's the way it is all over the strip. But the food was really good and the service was great.	
Nov 13 2009 	the worst hotel we have ever stayed in	we have just returned froma five day stay i this hotel. we had paid our travel agent an extra 250 pounds to upgrade to here from the stratosphere. BAD mistake. O n arrival we were allocated a room in the pyramid which was to say the least, dank and dirty looking. Dust on the furniture, carpet covered in stains and the bathroom had mildew in the shower cubicle. We went back down to check in desk and complained. The guy on the desk didnt even flinch which kinda gave us the idea that this must happen a lot. He allocated us another room again in the pyramid which was even worse than the first. As well as lots of stains on the carpet, there was what looked like a huge stain on the wall from the ceiling almost to the flloor which looked like dampnes. The furniture was tatty and there was lots of scratches on the wardrobe and table and bedside table was chipped in a few places. We phoned reception and again complained. We were told to go yet again to check in desk and would be given an upgrade to the west tower. Almost an hour and a half after arriving we finally got a room which i can only say was half way decent, although there were a few stains on the carpet. We ate in the cafe that night and were charged 50 +dollars for a very tough steak, stone cold potatoes and a tasteless pot pie. Oh yeah and my husbands beer glass was filthy and when he complained to the waitress. she actually asked him if he would like a clean one instead!!! We also ate in the more buffet. An all day pass is 30 dollars per person. Breakfast was just ok but dinner was better. No fridge in room, no coffee maker either so had to pay almost 10 dollars from starbucks every time we wanted tea or coffee. We have previously stayed in the circus circus and the sahara both of which were far superior in cleanliness and friendliness compared to the luxor. We will NEVER RETURN TO THIS HOTEL. it should be reclassed as a 2 0r 3 star at most.	
Nov 13 2009 	I love this hotel	I know I have been a bit late in writing this review but am booking my next trip to Vegas and thought I would see if the view of Luxor had changed - seems they have but I have to say that when I stayed there I had a fantatic time. Stayed there twice now and both times got upgraded to a larger room in the towers - two king size beds, loads of storage space and a bathroom like you wouldn't believe. The check in has always been quick and easy and I love the idea of having a Starbucks right there in the lobby so you can get a hot drink before bed (to wind you down after a hectic day). The chaps on the tables have always been friendly and the waitress service was great. The standard of decor and cleanliness is second to none and we had excellent housekeeping with loads of toiletries left everyday (I love that!). It is at the very end of the strip which is good for getting the Duece as it is pretty much the first stop so you can get a seat! Pain getting back to though as we spent a lot of time on Fremont Street. Overall I would highly recommend!!	
Nov 12 2009 	Do not stay in this hotel!	My husband and I recently stayed in this hotel and would not recommend it at all. Our rooms stunk of cigarette smoke even though we were told it was a non-smoking room. Staff were rude when we rang to complain about no coffee/tea making facilities and hung up on us. We had a broken lamp shade, tiles were lifting in the bathroom and carpet was worn. Worst of all my husband got bitten all over by bed bugs. We stayed there 3 nights and as we had 2 queen size beds I was not affected. He started scratching the day after we arrived and it wasnt until we left and I checked his back that we realized what had happened. We had upgraded to a better room so heavens knows what we would have gotten if we hadnt! This hotel needs a complete overhaul and new friendly staff .We have stayed in many hotels in the USA and this was probably the worst place we have chosen .	
Nov 12 2009 	OK for what we wanted	We were looking for a hotel in a good location for us to see Las Vegas. We spent most of the time away from the hotel so we only really used it as a place to sleep. The rooms were ok and suited us. When we were there the large pool was being repaired so te pool was extremely cramped and very uncomfortable.Price wise it was very reasonable however if you plan to base yourself at your hotel.... maybe you should look for other hotels.	
Nov 11 2009 	nice hotel fair price	The luxor is a nice hotel and the main building is a pyramide. the room and the casino are clean but not really my style (strange carpets etc). Night club was nice and quiet famous in LV. I can recommend the show in the hotel called &quot;fantasy&quot;, nice girls and very funny comedian. A negative point is that everything costs extra (very expensive internet etc.)	
Nov 11 2009 	Nothing like the pictures!	Service overall was good, other than a few over zealous security officials. This includes one security guard who pushed me out of the way (literally) to yell at another guest who was taking pictures of the lobby. (By the way, you are not allowed to take photos ANYWHERE in the facility. You will be yelled at and belittled). Rooms were extremely dated and not at ALL what was on the Luxor website. My friends' room did not have a closet or armoire. Beds were extremely uncomfortable (lop sided and old). Bedding was of very poor quality. Housekeeping was generally clean but did miss a lot of stuff in the room. 2 of the 4 days there was no bath mat, the shower was not cleaned properly, water bottles not replaced (which is supposedly included in the $12 per day resort fee&quot;), and there were long hairs in the toilet. Television reception was horrible, and the selection of channels was poor. The location is quite good. There is a free tram that runs from the Luxor to the Mandalay Bay and Excalibur. The hotel is on &quot;The Deuce&quot; bus route which goes up and down the strip to Freemont Street. Overall, this hotel may be OK if you had no extra money to spend, but I would imagine the rates at the Travelodge or Motel 6 down the street would likely be comparable if you're just looking for a room. If you can spend some more money, stay at the Mandalay Bay.	
Nov 11 2009 	Hotel is ok but not the best in Las Vegas	Luxor offers a good casino, range of restaurants and entertainment. The rooms are also a good size for the price. Drawbacks are that many rooms don't have baths, walls are very thin (noisy therefore) and the location is at the end of the strip. You do feel slightly out of the centre. A decent value option but not top draw.	
Nov 11 2009 	NOTHING SPECIAL	this hotel is nothing special. the reception area resembles a very busy shopping mall, and acts like one. the check-in area is not at all private and the whole place looks chaotic. the rooms are very average, no tea/coffee facilities and ours looked out over the air conditioning units and motorway...nice ! the frontage is very impressive [ but then so are all the others ] . overall it is as welcoming and as friendly as wormwood scrubs.	
Nov 11 2009 	Not coming back unless my new found friends come back first	Let me tell you, that unless you make a stink, they do not help you. I order room service the first day. Then left for business meeting. Two days, later, the tray with the left overs was still out in the hall. I notices the same with, other peoples trays. Honestly, they need hire more help, just to walk around the hotel and pick up dirty trays. The carpets need to be cleaner and the bathroom also. Coffee machines are needed in each room. They need security volts to place your personal items under lock and key. My trip was almost a total wash out, until I met this nice Germany couple. To bad I only had two days left. However, the SPA was great...Loved it. The night life, awesome.Over all, I do not want to come back. However, business is business...I traveled with the company and will most likely be there next November. If my new friend read this...give me a call. I am here 24/7.	
Nov 11 2009 	Luxor - not bad but nothing special	My wife and I planned a 2 night get-a-way to Vegas and chose the Luxor for price and location -we wanted to be able to walk to several of the resorts on the south end of the strip and the price here was reasonable - $50 per night Sun-Tuesday. We checked in around 1:30 local time - the check in staff was friendly and the process painless. We were up in our 26th floor room once we found the correct elevator. The room was nothing to brag about and other reviewers have mentioned the pyramid rooms are in need of refresh. I'd compare these rooms to a Hilton Garden Inn or maybe a Courtyard - nice but very basic - clean but with hard beds. Kind of what Vegas used to be before the mega resorts.We ate at the Cafe on our first day - the service was slow but the food generally good. We also had dinner on our 2nd night at 'Tender' - their steak and seafood outlet and the service was much better and the food very good - the wife has a seafood medley and I had the filet - both were excellent. The buffet is nothing to brag about.Overall the hotel was ok for what we needed - a room to crash in, a casino to gamble a bit in and a place we could use as a base to get to other casino's / resorts. The 'vibe' in the Luxor was 4 on a scale of 1-10 - 10 being New Years Eve or March Madness in Vegas. The New York New York hotel was much livelier and we'd probably stay there next time due to the variety of restaurants and things to do.	
Nov 10 2009 	DO NOT STAY - ROOM THEFT	Hotel does not CARE ABOUT THE GUESTSRecently stayed at the luxor for a conference and had a theft in the room. The Luxor security and risk management ultimately turn the blame on me the guest and ensure you know about the Nevada law. They do NOTHING for re-imbursement and DO NOT have any safes in the rooms. I stayed alone in the tower rooms so only access was via me.would not recommend staying at this hotel as there is little in the way of true customer services and respect of the consumer.Hotel is dirty and far from the strip where the real enjoyment is.	
Nov 10 2009 	Smokier than ever	I stayed at this hotel for our annual convention. The check in process in this hotel is awful. While still checking out my room, another couple entered the room with their key and said they had been given the room also. Back down to the desk.... Allow about 2 hours to check into this hotel. I could barely survive the smoky conditions there. They must be cutting down on ventilation to save money.	
Nov 10 2009 	Loved Las Vegas! Loved Luxor!	We almost canceled our 7 nights with Luxor, no thanks to the bad experiences we had with its sister hotel, The Excalibur. I am glad we didn't. This was a great hotel. We couldn't remember anything bad or remotely negative happened here. The price was very reasonable. The room was very spacious, very clean and tidy, and the unobstructed view (of the airport) was awesome. We could not ask for more. The staffs were very helpful in every way and answered all our [never-ending] queries without showing signs of annoyance. We were also surprised a front-desk staff took the time to lead us to our room. This kind of hospitality can only found in Asian hotels, or if you're paying big bucks for a hotel room and certainly not the US$140 we paid for it here. For that nice gesture, we did gave her a big tip.If only we knew how good this hotel was, we would've stayed at that no-good The Excalibur in the first place, which wasted 5 of our 12 nights in Las Vegas. We have planned for a return to Las Vegas in 2010 for 14 days. Luxor will be one of the hotels we'll be staying for sure!	
Nov 9 2009 	Talk about slanted elevators	Stayed in a Pyramid Room with friends for a 22nd birthday celebration. Good size rooms for 4 people. It was great having LAX right downstairs so we could just be an elevator ride to our rooms to pass out. Service at the Cafe was lacking, but the front desk/concierge were very helpful/friendly. Pools need to be kept a little better though. One of the hotels that have a &quot;resort fee&quot; of about $11 a night. Overall, a good stay though.	
Nov 9 2009	not that dated in fairness	Iread a review before I went that said the hotel was dated, the lifts were in fairness but then again how many people use them a day? From the upper floors of the Pyramid you could see litter on some of the buildings inside but otherwise it was fine. I was a bit miffed that there was no coffee making facilities which made it about an hour before the morning coffee hit and also there was no fridge in the room which I found strange. We were on the 18th floor and overlooked the Sphinx which was good so we could see the lights of the strip as it became dark. Overall we liked it and especially the Criss Angel show which was a bonus for my daughter.	
Nov 9 2009 	Great value!	Our second stay at the Luxor. No line to check-in; we were checked-in immediately. We had booked a Pyramid room but on arrival were offered a free upgrade to a room in the East Tower. Having stayed in the Pyramid last time, we accepted the free upgrade and are glad we did. The Tower room was much better than the Pyramid room. It was very clean and comfortable, with a good size bathroom. The room was quieter than the room we had had previously in the Pyramid, and it wasn't so far to talk to the elevator.We had room service twice and the service was quick, efficient and friendly. All of the staff we came into contact with were friendly and helpful.The Luxor is away from the main part of the strip but it's easy to get a taxi if you need one.We didn't eat at the Luxor as we wanted to try the other hotels.All in all, we were pleased with the hotel, which is excellent value.	
Nov 9 2009 	Decent but could've been much better	After traveling to Las Vegas for many years, I finally decided to make my stay here, using some free comped nights at the Luxor. (3 nights/4 days)From the get-go...Walked into the hotel with a friend and was completely lost where the check-in was. My friends and I stayed in the West Tower, which is hidden in a very far corner from the main hotel lobby area, and the walk there was pretty damn far. After finding the West Tower (VIP) check-in, we waited for a little bit while waiting in the VIP lounge. Registration was simple, but for whatever reason, the check-in rep really had no personality. Got the keys and headed to the room.The RoomThe room was located in the &quot;West Tower.&quot; After seeing some pics from TripAdvisor, there didn't seem a huge difference between the Pyramid Tower and the West Tower, with the exception that room wasn't on a slanted side. The furniture was old, the TV was a big tube, not updated with the LCDs, and the wall paint was faded. The room size was decent, nothing extremely huge. There were a few things I found odd in our room though. No coffee maker (would've been nice to have one for the morning), no mini-fridge (don't care if I spend $ on a few drinks), and no safety deposit! What the hell...even if these rooms are comped, the usual rates go for $100~$120 a night and I don't get these things? Crap. I also disliked their &quot;resort fee&quot; which covers a daily newspaper, use of gym, and 2 water bottles. Really? [--], gotta be kiddin' meRestaurant (similar to Hospital cafeteria food)So using my comps this time for the rooms, we received free comps to be used at the buffet. Eww, the selection of breakfast food was horrible. I really don't think I want to get into much, but let's just say that the service in there was more like on-your-own-service. There brunch was also crap too. Go elsewhere, go down to Fremont Street for better, cheaper food.Toward the end (check-out)We checked out 4 days later which wasn't a problem. Did it through the TV. Luckily the valet service was right outside the West Tower side so got a cab pretty fast. Repeat at the Luxor?Possibly. I'd like to be able to stay in the suites for a more spacious room, but perhaps I'll give other hotels a try. We'll just see.	
Nov 9 2009 	Roomy good service and lots of fun	We staying in a pyramid deluxe room and its was very roomy, clean and comfortable. Great views and amenties and yummy breakfast for room service. Staff were helpful and easy going. Good location without being right in the middle of vegas (The Duece bus stops right out the front).	
Nov 8 2009 	careful	visited luxor what a disaster, had bag stolen, security are laughable, had to tell security to check toiilet and lifts after a while .. 30 mins they did , my bag turned up in a lift minus cards,money, passports which we had to carry as id never again. they would't even look at security tapes would not recomend this hotel to anyone the security need training in common sense....	
Nov 8 2009 	A very comfortable stay	This is my first time writing a hotel review, but I felt duty bound to do so after using this site as a resource for organizing my holiday.I must confess that I was a little anxious about staying at the Luxor after reading some of the reviews, but I am pleased to say that my stay at the hotel was absolutely fine.I arrived at the Luxor at around 9pm on a Saturday night. Check-in took no longer than 5 minutes. The check-in staff were very friendly.I stayed in a Tower Deluxe room on the 4th floor of the West Tower. The room was very clean and extremely spacious, especially the bathroom with a separate bath and shower. The only bad point is that there were two queen beds in the room, instead of the one king bed I had requested. This was not a great concern for me, but I can understand how that could annoy others.The location of the hotel is often cited as a bad point in the reviews I've read; I really cannot understand this. Although it is at the southern end of the strip, it can hardly be described as being in a bad location. I found that I either took a taxi (if going to the Wynn or anywhere further north) or a leisurely walk to my destination (if going up to anywhere as far as the Bellagio). There is certainly no hindrance to being based at the Luxor.I did not use the pool or spa facilities at the hotel and did not dine there often. I had one meal in the food court, which was fine, and one meal at Tender, which was absolutely fantastic - highly recommended.The casino was fairly standard. Personally, I found the ambiance to be a little subdued and much preferred the casinos at the Bellagio and the Mirage, but this is just a matter of individual preference.The one thing to watch out for are the Timeshare sales reps. They congregate around the lobby and engage you in friendly coversation before revealing their true intent. In my opinion, they seem to act as official hotel staff, which is irritating.The hotel service was good for me. I always came back to a tidy room. The only other interaction I had was with the check-in and check-out staff. Check-out was just as fast as check-in and the staff were equally friendly. I did not have to pay the resort fee upon check-out. I'm not entirely sure why this was the case. I booked my holiday with Expedia and can only assume that the fee was included in that price.So to summise, I believe the Luxor to be a very nice hotel offering excellent value for money. I can think of no reason whatsoever to book this hotel again for my next outing to Las Vegas and I would not hesitate to recommend it to my friends and family.Have fun in Vegas!	
Nov 8 2009 	OK - not as bad as expected	I stayed here at the start of a road trip to Las Vegas and Northern California. I was concerned as reading some of the reviews, but it was not as bad as expected. I didn't pay top dollar for the room, so I wasn't expecting too much. I was also braced for a long check in .. however ...After the short trip from airport, I was pleased to see that the line wasn't that long, despite being 3pm on Saturday afternoon. Took around 15 minutes to get to front of queue. The staff was efficicent, and sorted me out a room, that i request - high up and facing strip/airport. (to be fair, many many times when I was passing the reception area, the check in lines were REALLY long - I think I struck lucky). The room was spacious and clean. OK, it was a little tired, but not shockingly bad. Plenty of room, and not as dark as I'd feared. The bathroom, again, was clean, with a decent shower. The lifts were OK, no long waits. The hotel, as I'm sure many have mentioned, is at the south end of the strip, so when we were meeting freinds, who were staying at Venitain, it was quite a walk. But I was aware of this before I travelled. The pool area was large, although some parts weren't open. If you want a cheap hotel, with OK rooms, I would recommend - just don't set you bar too high	
Nov 8 2009 	Worse than I expected	We stayed for 6 nights in early November. The main pool was closed during our stay leaving only the 3 foot kiddie pool open which was a HUGE disappointment. The buffet was horrible, unedible. The rooms were small and not too clean. When we complained to the manager that the rooms were nothing like what we saw on the internet, we were told that you can't expect every room to look like a model room. FALSE ADVERTISING. Staff and management were pretty unfriendly and unhelpful and that's coming from me, a NEW YORKER! Stay at the Paris or Venitian or Mirage instead if you want a nice hotel.	
Nov 7 2009 	LUXOR HOTEL	I stay at the Luxor for 6 days with my 7 yrs old and husband. They hotel is ok, nothing fancy or wow about. For Adult would be ok, definitely not for children. The worst was cigarette smell. I can even smell it in our room which is non smoking room. We went to other hotels like the Mandalay bay. MGM grand, Cesar. They all had less cigarette smell and more fun stuff for kids to do.Self parking and pool are at the far end of the building. it takes at least 10 mins to get there.that is another thing i am not thrill about.Over all the stuffs at the hotel are friendly.	
Nov 6 2009 	A big dissapointment	After two weeks of traveling we expected more. This was very the worst place we stayed. The quality and attention to details was lacking. The room was cheap, the service was quite poor. Very showy but it's just a facade with no substance behind it. Will never stay there again.	
Nov 6 2009 	Overpriced and over rated	We found our room to be on par with the Best Westerns in actual fact some were better at alot less cost. The air conditioning was very noisy but had to have on as windows didnt open at all. If we had realised that the smaller chain hotels were as close to the strip would have stayed there. Airport is so close you could see from the window. Fruit mahines in vegas are a let down. You dont play them they play you i.e. there is no nudge no save no nothing you just push the button and they play it for you!!! No coins falling out of machine on a win either. All Vouchers now. Vegas is a money pit. It is geared at every opportunity to you spending money. Glad we experienced it but more glad we only stayed a couple of nights	
Nov 5 2009	Luxor hotel and las vegas	We stayed in the Luxor Hotel, the pyramid shape hotel with the huge beam coming out the top of it! At least you can always see where it is! Our room had a great jacuzzi and sitting room area, huge room! Managed to almost fill the room with bubbles and foam one night lol...The Inclinators are very weird....sideways lifts...took me a while to get use to them. Las Vegas is ok, though if you arent into gambling like me it get a bit tedious! We did a few shows...bbe careful.some places are little more than pick up bars with hookers. The high light was the heliopter trip to the grand canyon...i hate heights so flying over the edge was stomach churning! . It was an experience but not my kind of place. All the hotels look fantastic from outside, magical and you can spend the whole time without actually going outdoors as they are all linked by walk ways and esalators!	
Nov 4 2009 	Don't go here horrible!!	the hotel experience was awful. The employees at this hotel are thiefs. do yourself a favor and dont stay here. I spoke to security so they could pull tapes of my wallet being stolen and they say the camers at this hotel couldnt pull up an image because the cameras werent looking at the image of the front desk when i was checking in. the front desk clerk stole my wallet. the security cameras suck at this hotel. anything can happen and they wouldnt have any proof because there cameras dont work.	
Nov 3 2009 	Glad I didn't pay for it	I was attending a conference at the Mandalay Bay Hotel next to the Luxor and stayed in the Luxor from October 25th through October 30th. I booked the hotel a few weeks prior and received a rate of $50 a night (plus a $10.99 resort fee per night, plus $14.99 internet access per day). I had read reviews of the Luxor online and wasn't sure what to expect, but it wasn't as bad as others reported. We checked in around 11 AM and a room was available. The line for checking in was quite long, as folks were checking in for the convention that week. But it went efficiently.The room was on the 4th floor, and was somewhat near the elevators. We had a King room in the Pyramid, number 4085. It faced the towers and had a lovely view of a concrete wall (which is to say, it faced nothing). If we were to flatten our faces to the window, we could see some palm trees and the desert mountains in the distance, but that was it. The carpet had been updated recently and was contemporary in design, though the bedspread was quite dated and was still the old and tired Egyptian-themed design. The bathroom had been recently re-done.There was no wireless internet in the room, and there was no desk. There was a table and two chairs near the window that I had to drag across the room so that I cold reach the internet cable to plug my laptop in. The bed was an older spring mattress and I could feel some of the springs poking me in my back as I lay in the bed. The insulation wasn't very soundproof as we could hear the squeaking of the inclinators (they don't call them elevators, because they angle upward following the contour of the pyramid), as well as other guests in their rooms or in the hallway outside.There was some gum stuck to the bathroom floor that blended in with the faux slate tile, which is maybe why housekeeping didn't see it to clean it. We didn't get housekeeping one day, so we had to call to get a couple of towels exchanged, and to have the trash taken out. On our last day, housekeeping didn't come until 6:30 PM. I recommend a restaurant called Tacos and Tequila (or T&amp;T as they call it) for great authentic Mexican food. Baja Tacos (3 of them) are $16, nachos with fajita steak was $14 (without chicken or fajita steak was $12), the Tamale plate was $11, queso was $2, chips and awesome salsa was complimentary. Another restaurant called Company Kitchen was good, though pricey. The pulled pork sandwich was $18, their salads range in price from $7 to $9. I HIGHLY recommend their fried mashed potato sticks ($9) and the filet mignon stuffed with blue cheese ($32). Their hamburgers were around $16 to $20 (depending on what you wanted on it). A side of asparagus was $9, a side of mashed potatoes was $7, scallops were $13, bacon-wrapped shrimp was $11. There are three Starbuck's in the Luxor and the one on the atrium level (I think that's level 3) was never busy and we were always able to walk right up and order even between the hours of 8 and 10 (when the two downstairs Starbucks were busy). Their prices are what you would find elsewhere, $3 for a grande American coffee. Fifty-five cents for a shot of flavoring.Their fitness center is pretty dang nice, with Precor-brand tredmills, eliptical runners, and bikes. There were at least 10 treadmills, and 5 eliptical runners as well as 6 or 7 stationary bikes (both upright and recumbent bikes). There were free weights, and some universal equipment available. There was very little floor space to put down a yoga mat and stretch, but they also had large yoga balls as well. You get free water from a little fridge while you're there, and the use of the gym is included with the $10.99 resort fee.The hotel price was right for the level of service that I received, but I wouldn't have been happy had the price been any higher. -Jen	
Nov 3 2009 	My get away	.very nice . so much to do never really had to leave the hotel they have every thing you need	
Nov 3 2009 	Loved it!	Overall, I liked the Luxor. The check in lines during the week were fine, less than a five minute wait. On Saturday, the lines had maybe twenty people waiting but with several clerks checking them in. I didnt care much for the security that would not allow pictures taken in the entryway of the hotel. I assume it was to keep the flow of traffic, but I didnt notice any other hotel not allow pictures. The staff was friendly. The room was nicely decorated. Minor details, but beware of the very loud flushing toilets in the room, as it is loud enough to wake up light sleepers. There were lamps scattered through the room but very low light. The hotel has a food court with McDonalds and other fast food places. (The McDonalds had Sweet Tea, which is difficult to find outside of the South!) I also enjoyed the Bodies Exhibition. Very disturbing and fascinating. If you have any interest in anatomy or frankly, horror movies, this is a must see and worth the $30 ticket. General Vegas tips, be prepared to walk and walk and walk. The hotels are massive, the walkways to the hotels are massive. It can be done, just wear comfortable shoes, and stay safe within the crowd. If you time it right, you can see the fountains at Bellagio, then the Volcano at the Mirage and then the Sirens show at Treasure Island all in a short period of time  well worth the walk. In my opinion, the Bellagio Buffet is the best in Vegas and worth $21 for lunch for one person.	
Nov 3 2009 	All good at the Luxor.....	We were more than a little apprehensive about our stay at the Luxor, mainly after reading all the poor reviews on here.However...we were more than pleasantly suprised. We arrived at 17.00hrs on Monday night after a very tiring and stressful journey from the UK. We queued for less than 5 minutes to check-in and asked for a room 'high-up' as we wanted a decent view and minimal noise. The receptionist was polite and professional ( as most of the staff were) and we were given a room on the 21st floor. We did not have to leave a credit card, all our resort fees etc were already paid in our inclusive package - worth checking before you pay online.The room was spacious, clean and the carpet looked brand new. The only minor gripe was that we were given 2 queen beds and not the king we had initially booked. But this wasn't an issue and didn't cause us any problems. The maid cleaned our room every day, fresh towels provided and clean bedding. The bathroom was in good order, hot water whenever we needed to shower, and the most amazing view across the back of Vegas and the dessert mountains. There was no noise, aside from hearing next doors toilet flushing! and we certainly weren't kept awake by any pool parties even though our room overlooked the pool (which we though was very nice, but not quite as good as others we saw).We joined the Mgm PLAYERS club, which meant we accrued points from using the machines etc across the MGM hotels (LUXOR, NY NY, MGM, EXCALIBUR ETC). We accrued over $300 in comps, which we used for meals, exhibitions, drinks etc..saving us a lot of money. The casino was dark, but aren't they all? the smell of ciggarette smoke was sometimes overwhelming, but again it's the same everywhere. The machines here payout..I won £1400 on one machine alone! The food was nice, no complaints from either of us. We had a meal at the Tender steak restaurant, and it was probably the best steak that I have ever tasted ,with excellent service. Very pricey, but we used our comps to pay.The titanic exhibition was pretty awesome..definitely worth a look if you are in Vegas. The timeshare people do try to hassle you, but we just said a firm 'no thanks' and they left us alone.The hotel itself is huge, but you are given a guide to get around and finding your bearings after a couple of days isn't too difficult. It is at the far end of the strip, but we used the monorail to get around as well as lots of walking and cabs.We really enjoyed our stay here, and are suprised at some of the unfavourable comments left by other guests. The place is a little run down in parts and in need of a make-over, but this didn't affect our stay and we were possibly just lucky with the room we were allocated.We did a quick express check-out, you can do this through the TV system and our bill was $0.00..no add-ons or mysterious charges. We do plan to return to Vegas again and may return to the Luxor. If we don't it will be because we want to experience another hotel and no other reason relating to the quality of the environment or service within this hotel.	
Nov 3 2009 	Great hotel	fab pool area, with the usual casino stuff insiderooms comfortable, dining options plentiful, nice to be at the end of the strip 	
Nov 3 2009 	Pleasant Stay	I went to Vegas alone and enjoyed every moment from check-in to express check-out. I stayed Oct. 28 - Nov. 2, 2009. I felt extremely safe @ the Luxor, esp. since you have to place your key in the elevator to get to your room. I paid for a pyramid room - I got a free upgrade to 14th floor in East Towers. The room was spacious, but the lighting was dim and the beds were not pillow top. LOL! Dinner @ the More Buffet wasn't good. The Bodies exhibit is great. You are not allowed to take pics of the statue inside of the hotel (per sign &amp; security). The staff was extremely helpful &amp; friendly. I would stay here again!	
Nov 3 2009 	Luxortastic	Stayed at the Luxor October 09. My first impression was of the size. It is enormous. For the price of the room I was impressed. We had a suite on the 13th floor (Why they have 13th floors in Vegas I'll never know) and it was bigger than my flat (around 800sq ft) The staff were very friendly even though I was a little ratty (the airline lost our luggage). The room itself was clean and well kept if a little tired. The whole hotel seems to need a lick of paint and some new furniture but unless you're really picky that's not a problem. In comparison to other resort hotels in Vegas I would estimate that it is still, despite being almost twenty years old, one of the top and there were few that we saw that were better and none that were better value for money. The range of restaurants is good from McDonalds too a high end steak restaurant. The steak place wasn't that great and there are far better value for money restaurants on the strip. They forgot to clean our room a couple of times which annoyed me but it's something you have to live with. I was disappointed that the tickets and exhibitions weren't discounted significantly for hotel guests as I would have liked to have seen the Titanic exhibition but wasn't prepared to spend $80 to do it. All in all its exactly what you expect. Professionalism and courtesy American style. The more money you have the more polite they are.	
Nov 2 2009 	Nice suite in the newer tower	The suites in the newer tower are spacious and nicely decorated. Housekeeping service was outstanding when we needed extra pillows and towels (but $30 a night for a roll-away bed was excessive). The rates we paid were very good for the room size ($128 per night). Great value. Location is a bit far from the major attractions even with the monorail, but the weather was good so not a bad walk. We wanted to use the pool but it was closed most of the time for some reason. Overall the experience was very good for the price. We did eat at the buffet once and two of us got sick so not sure what happened.	
Nov 2 2009 	Dont' stay here if you want a great holidays	What a shock. Sexy black pyramid of hotel Luxor is actually very dark, very smelly and very outdated property in a not great location. Chaotic lay out, darkness 24/7 , horrible smell in the rooms and in the huge concrete lobby. Peeling off wallpapers, lift buttons falling apart. No proper light in the rooms and decor and furniture estremelley dated.... Everything is far away from there and hotel dont' offer any exciting variety of dining and entertainment. Titanic museum? Had have to change the room becouse of the smell, same as my friends ( and we choose non smoking ! ) No in room safes, ancient noisy air conditioning and holes in the towels. Do I have to say more? Las Vegas is great, so dont' ruin it staying in Luxor please!!!	
Nov 2 2009 	Dissapointed in Vegas	Nov. 2, 2009Traveled to Vegas for a family wedding held at the Luxor Hotel. My first trip to Vegas in about 20 years and so was looking forward to staying on the strip and at one of the famous theme hotels. Well I wont' be returning to this hotel and I would not recommend the place. Staff was OK but not very friendly. My typical hotel room was clean but dated and a bit run down looking, however got clean sheets and towels everyday even thought the note in the bathroom ask that you reuse your towels because of the drought conditions. Here is what I did not like: the place is very confusing to get around in, hallways are like mazes and hard to navigate,its dark and noisy. One party member was in a wheelchair and we had a heck of a time trying to find elevators to get to other levels in the Casino and the staff wasn't much help. No real hotel lobby with seating areas where one could sit and people watch or meet friends and talk or just read your newspaper,etc. Restaurants where a rip off,unattractive and noisy. Pool area was a lot of concrete not attractive at all. We ended up going next door to MadalayBay for everything. It's beautiful, lovely shops and resturants. We had breakfast at Raffles Cafe in MadalayBay , the setting - beautiful. service- oh my, wonderful, food - attractively served and delicious! Prices were the same at Luxor restaurants but --- you are in a gorgeous setting and QUIET (no noise or smoke from the Casino).Oh yes, the wedding was very nice, there is a chapel and once inside very quiet, elegant, the ceremony was lovely and we had a great dinner - so there are some good points to the whole experience. I would not recommend this hotel especially after seeing what some of the other hotels have to offer. If you must stay at this end of the strip stay at MadalayBay you will be much happier.Susan	
Nov 2 2009 	Good Hotel	Myself and my girlfriend decided to go about 3 weeks beofre the date. We booked on expedia and got a good deal. We arrived it was a great hotel, very clean and front desk was really nice. The only issue we found with this hotel was we were not able to take photo's? Whats with that. This is a tourist city an people come and want to take pictures. No other hotel had this rule and no signs posted like The Luxor, Other then that we didn't really spend much time in the hotel because of that and we plan on going back for a week in the next few months. I liked the hotel but would never stay again just because of that rule.	
Nov 1 2009 	Great for the price	We stayed here for our 1 year anniversary. Got a Jacuzzi suite for 3 nights (Sat-Tues) and 2 round trip tickets from SNA for $604. It was the best priced trip yet! The room was clean and big. The Jacuzzi overlooked the Excalibur pool and had a great view. It has a refrigerator that you don't have to pay for :) The bed was comfortable, but no Treasure Island! We didn't spend a lot of time in the room this time though. We went to T&amp;T tacos at the Luxor and it was the best Mexican food ever. And we live in SoCal- so that's saying alot. We ate their 3 times and the prices were great- about $25 for both of us and we had so much food, we saved it in our fridge and ate it later. Bought some hot sauce too, because it was awesome. We gambled at the slots, but didn't win much so we went to the Imperial Palace and won a bit more at the wheel of fortune. Of course had to get room service and that was delicious and not as much as other hotels. There was a lot of food. Check in was quick- long line, but went very fast. We checked out on the TV (recommended for all hotels!) We will stay here again if the price is the same. Good place to plan in advance! They gave us coupons that we used for Starbucks and the buffett (which was good too)	
Nov 1 2009 	Luxor took care of us...	Luxor made us an offer to visit and we are sure glad we accepted. We had stayed at the Luxor once before so we knew that we would like it again. We had a west tower luxury suite which was very large and comfortable. The 22nd floor is very quiet and the west tower is not too far from the restaurants and casino. The staff was pleasant and efficient in check-in, the casino, and the restaurants. We never had one rude employee the whole trip. We were comped for our play fairly. I could only wish for two things: a pillow-top mattress and softer toilet paper and tissue!	
Oct 30 2009 	Great facade dump of an interior	We excitedly walked into the huge pyramid thinking we'd checked into a nice hotel. We were given a room in the separate tower. After walking through a long and very shoddy corridor we got to the elevator bank. Another shoddy corridor brought us to our room. It was pitch black. We opened the curtains and the depressingly small amount of light this let in revealed what a dump of a room we'd bought for 2 nights. In comparison to the Mandalay Bay where we'd just come from this was on a different planet. Probably Uranus. It was worse than the Orleans room we'd stayed in earlier which doesn't pretend to be in the top Strip hotel league.The lunch buffet was awful, really awful, again bettered by the Orleans, which is saying a lot because that was pretty bad.The pool was also a bit crap.The whole hotel and casino seemed dark and dingy. The only good thing was taking the elevator to the 21st (top) floor (you need to shadow someone that is staying there because you need your hotel key to get the elevator to stop at a particular floor) and looking down on the interior.I didn't believe some of the bad reviews here thinking that seeing as it looks so COOL from the outside, it must be pretty cool on the inside. WRONG. It's a total dump. Do yourself a favour and stay someplace else.	
Oct 30 2009 	ok for the money	nice hotel. the rooms a bit dark and dingy.staff are friendly enough and bar staff in the casino are good. location is very good	
Oct 30 2009 	Not the best out there	Pros:- Rooms (in the east tower) are nice as well as the bathroom (it has jacuzzi)- Hotel is quite luxurious- Underground passage and monorail to Mandalay Bay and ExcaliburCons:- Long lines at check-in (like most hotels in Vegas)- So-so casino- Time-share representatives always try to offer you something- Far from center strip- No thrillsConclusion: The hotel is ok but I'm not sure I would recommend it at the current prices.	
Oct 29 2009 	Dark dreary depressing	This may have been the worst hotel experience of our lives. If you are expecting a four star resort you will be sorely disappointed. The rooms at this hotel are no different than those you would find at a badly maintained motor lodge. The moment we walked in to our room we were disgusted, (peeling wallpaper, hard water stains in the bathroom, a bed that felt like quicksand, terrible odor, and just plain old) and immediately turned around and went back downstairs to the front desk to attempt an upgrade. After agreeing on an unreasonable sum that I will not mention we went back upstairs to check out our new &quot;Players Club&quot; room. This was the same room as the previous motel 6 iteration with a flat screen TV, a refrigerator, and a bed that almost swallowed us whole. This room had even worse lighting and looked unfit for a troll. We stayed for one night in this dungeon of a hotel room and could no longer take it. I called the front desk in the morning and said we had to leave, &quot;this room is disgusting and your hotel is terrible, we can no longer stay here because this place is literally making us sick&quot;, I casually told the front desk employee. It's interesting to note here that the employee i spoke with did not protest at all, ask me what was wrong, what they could do, or even tell me I was wrong. She basically agreed with me and told me that this happens often in not so many words. She let us out of our reservation with no penalty and we left for another hotel on the strip that was fantastic, and just a bit more expensive. This is not a four star hotel. This isn't even a three star hotel. This place is so bad that the Luxor does not deserve to be reviewed and compared alongside luxury hotels in Las Vegas. The amenities here are garbage, my grandmother's retirement community has a better pool and fitness center. The fact that Luxor masquerades as a luxury hotel is an affront to the entire hospitality industry. The sooner this pile of garbage covered with black glass that is the Luxor is demolished the better. It is a disgrace to the city of Las Vegas and the whole country. I hate you Luxor, I hate you.	
Oct 29 2009 	Great theme but on far end of strip	We had some minor issues with this hotel, but we are not one to complain. We got woken at 7am every morning with construction noise. We were not told of construction prior to booking and we couldn't switch rooms because there were 'no other rooms,' but the hotel did refund two nights stay. The pool is nice, but nothing spectacular. The casino is on the smaller end compared to some of the other hotels on the strip. The one downside is it's all the way on the one side of the strip, so to go to the other end it's quite the hike. While I would stay at this hotel again and recommend it, next time I think I will try for a more central location.	
Oct 29 2009 	The most amazing holiday	This was the first time we had visited the USA so we weren't sure what to expect. Thankfully we had only ever heard good things about Vegas and we weren't disappointed. On arriving we got a taxi from the airport to The Luxor  I think the taxi driver seen us coming as it cost a lot less going back to the airport when we were leaving than it did when we arrived. The taxi driver dropped us off at one of the side entrances to the hotel and given its size (even though its probably one of the smaller hotels) we had difficulty finding the check-in. Id advise you ask the taxi driver to take you to the main entrance. When we did finally find the check-in we didnt see any sign of the big queues other people have mentioned and were in our room within 15 minutes of arriving. The ticket touts will try and entice you as soon as you walk in. They tried to give us free show tickets, but only if we spent 2 hours at a presentation. They were very polite and a quick no thanks meant they wouldnt keep pestering. The Luxor is a lovely hotel, our room was large, with a great view over the Mandalay Bay hotel and we had no issues with the housekeeping, our daily papers and water arriving as promised. The pool was great, a good place to chill out for the few times you want to relax!We only really ate breakfast in the hotel and both the buffet and café provided excellent choice. We had brunch at T&amp;Ts one day which was also really good. Although practically at the end of the strip the Luxor still felt really close to the action, with the MGM Grand and New York New York only a short walk away. If we wanted to get around quickly we would use the monorail at the MGM, by far the best way to get up and down the strip. Must see hotels have to be the MGM Grand (the lion enclosure is amazing) The Venetian, The Palazzo and the Bellagio (if you want to get a good spot for the Bellagio fountains go in plenty of time. The same goes for Treasure Island. If you dont get there early youll miss half the show) and if like Allan you are a bit of a daredevil the rides at the top of the Stratosphere shouldnt be missed. The views from the top of the Stratosphere are pretty amazing too. We went on two helicopter trips while we were there  a night time flight over the strip which was just amazing and then another trip to the Grand Canyon. The Grand Canyon trips seem quite expensive but once you get there its well worth the money. It has to be one of the most stunning places on this earth. We opted for the trip that took us over Lake Mead and the Hoover Dam, then down into the canyon. You get half an hour to explore and take the most amazing pictures, with a light picnic provided. We went with Maverick Helicopters for both trips and found the pilots very helpful, knowledgeable and chatty, happy to answer any questions we had.This was by far the best holiday we have ever been on, and we cant wait to go back. There is so much to see and do that a week isnt nearly long enough. We wouldnt hesitate to stay at The Luxor again but there are so many other fantastic looking hotels well probably stay elsewhere.	
Oct 29 2009 	The hotel is nice except for the rooms.	The pyramid rooms were disqusting. The towels and carpets were dirty and the beds appeared to be smaller than a queen. I'd choose another option if I were you...it is not a 4 star by far....its more like a 1.5 or 2.	
Oct 29 2009 	Would go back	Hi All,Firstly let me say that I am amused by some previous reviews by people who are quite obviously from the &quot;Champagne tastes - Beer budget&quot; category and feel the need to voice their utter disappointment with something they would expect but not pay for :-) :-) Myself and my wife stayed here between 14 - 18 October and found it to be excellent value for money. We arrived at 10pm from Ireland and were greeted by friendly check in staff and were processed within 5 minutes. The directions to the room could not have been made any easier so the comments about rooms being difficult to find should not bother anyone who understands left &amp; right and have no numeracy problems. I mean, 19th floor room 102 is not the hard to follow( press 19 when you get into the lift and away you go)The room was extremely clean and had a great view of the lobby etc so no problems there either. The bathroom was also clean and again our room was cleaned each day and a small tip for doing so was left out in appreciation. I assume people who visit a country that works on a tipping culture actually tip????? If not then bad service and whatever else goes with it is your own fault. You are paying buttons for everything so not to tip is unforgivable in my opinion. The Champagne - Beer scenario rears its ugly head here again. Also included in the price is $40 worth of starbucks and $40 for the buffet. That makes the Luxor 360 for 4 nights inc flights from Ireland. If you attempt to complain about that then you are just one of those people who have an obsession with putting a negative spin on everything you do.........You pay for what you get so STOP bad mouthing a relatively good value hotel when you expect a Royal Palace for less than $400???????Would i go back = YesIs it good value = YesIs it a royal palace = NoIs it comfortable and clean = YesAre they friendly = YesIs the food good = YesIs the gaming good = Moderate ( went from place to place)Marks out of 5 = 4What improvements could be made = dont spray as much freshner on the carpets in the casino as they do, it can be strong and irretating at times.	
Oct 28 2009 	Ok if you are on a budget	Didn't like at all. Won't mind paying more for a better hotel. Got a great rate from AAA but not worth paying more that $50 a night anyway.	
Oct 28 2009	Las Vegas wedding good fun - Luxor a disappointment.	Most of the wedding party (literally) stayed at the Luxor, and within 24 hours were partying elsewhere. The novelty of the pyramid rooms soon wore off. The elevators ('Inclinometers')were confusing, as was the floor &amp; room layout. $6 for a domestic beer, 8 bucks for a drink.$13 for a so-so breakfast in the restaurant; many guests quickly found the food court, and visited McDonalds, Quiznos, etc. there several times a day. The three Starbucks in the hotel were also a lifesaver. Our son's suite (he was the groom) was kinda cool, and unlike the standard room had a little fridge. But no coffee maker.Service was spotty at best, with carts and trays of dirty dishes left for hours in the hallways.Our room wasn't cleaned for 2 days, and then it took several phone calls. Ultimately we were comped a night for the strange lack of service...but our bill was so confusing we can't see if the comp was ever really applied.The Las Vegas Strip is a rip-off; it's for newbies, and we new that. But the kids wanted the Strip, and of course it was their party. We are Downtown Vegas people, ( Golden Nugget rules) and stayed on the Strip to be close to the family. I don't care who's getting married, we wouldn't stay at the Luxor, or on the Strip again.	
Oct 27 2009 	Worst hotel experience ever	Ok where to start...we arrived at the Luxor late on a Sunday night after a long flight. After queuing for a while to check in we found ourselves in shock at how rude the girl that served us was. Not even a welcome or hello just photo id and credit card. We were &quot;pointed&quot; in the direction of our room which we eventually found. The room was a disgrace was on a low floor and the front door was damaged and stained. Inside the room the carpets were stained, the bed sheets stained, the wardrobe broken with a foot print on it tiles in the bathroom broken, someone's used soap in the bathroom, water stains on the curtains lights not working, and some kind of stains on the chairs. We were disgusted with the filth. we went back down to reception and only after speaking to four different (rude) people we eventually got a different room. No improvement so we ended up in the Hard Rock which was heaven compared to this joke of a hotel. We express checked out just so we didn't have to deal with these people again!!!The atrium is the only half decent thing about it but even at that you can't walk around it without being offered rubbish every 2 minutes. The buffet was about the only decent thing about this hotel. It was quite reasonable with a very varied selection. Apart from that we will never ever set foot in this hotel again. Spend an extra few dollars on a better hotel on the strip	
Oct 27 2009 	Awful- Do not stay at Luxor	This was our first trip to Vegas. We checked out fares for every hotel and it seemed like Luxor was the best value. However, when we arrived at the hotel, we immediately found out why it was so cheap. This hotel was basically like a Motel 6 on the strip. When we arrived there, we were asked to come to a table to sign up for a morning session where they would try to sell us a timeshare. We were actually going to sign up to attend because of the incentives they were offering. However, we wanted to drop our bags off to our room first and then come back. We hadn't even checked in yet! We told them we would come back, just let us go check in. When we went to go check in, they gave us the room key. As we were walking to our room, we overheard the lady say to the other person working with her that we were the couple that didn't sign up. We were actually going to drop our bags off and come back to sign up for it but we didn't after she made that comment. 1. I had purchased a King bed room with a spa inside.  -luxor gave us a room with two double beds!!2. When I called, they said that I wasn't guaranteed a king bed and that no hotel offers a guaranteed King bed suite. We were celebrating our anniversary and I definitely wanted a King bed suite. They said they couldn't get us one until the next day. 3. When we got into the room and turned on the lights, There were bugs in the room. I requested us to move to another room or let us go to another hotel because we would not stay there. The manager at Luxor told us that we would get charged for one night anyway even though we had just arrived!! If we would've known that this place was so grose, we wouldn't have come here in the first place. We had to stay because we didn't want to get double charged. So we thought we would just check out immediately in the morning it was so late anyways.4. The next morning, I had 5 bug bites on me when I woke up. It was ridiculous. During the night, the walls are so thin between each room that my wife woke up hearing the people in the room next door fighting next door. She literally did not get good sleep. 5. The people at the Luxor told us that nobody would give us a guaranteed King bed and I immediately called the Venetian and they guaranteed a King Bed luxory suite for me for 4 nights stay for pretty much the exact same price Luxor was trying to charge us.6. Luxor put a hold of about $600 on my credit card for the 4 nights stay and would'nt release it even after I had left. I had to call their account receivable department 4 times over a period of an hour to get them to take that authorization hold off my card. I finally had to call the manager to get it resolved. All they had to do was make a phone call and get it done but it took me calling them 5 times before it was taken off.7. We asked around about why Luxor was like this and we were told that the hotels were losing money and the cleaning staff is overworked. They are not cleaning the rooms properly and not even the comforters on the beds. This hotel is one of several owned so it's not well taken care of. 8. We ended up going to Venetian for the remainder of our stay and had the time of our lives. It was immaculate inside and the rooms were very well cleaned. If you do anything, do not stay at Luxor because you'll be disappointed. The staff is rude, the rooms are filthy and badly kept and the walls are as thin as you could imagine. The rooms do not have free Wi Fi nor do they have flat screen TV's.	
Oct 27 2009 	Pretty amazing	We stayed in the Luxor for 2 weeks and found it lovely. The hotel is amazing, the room was lovely and a great size. We paid just over £600 for 2 weeks and that was the total not per person so you can see the money value was amazing. We stayed in the pyramid which I would say has to be done esp if it's your first time in the Luxor, so much is going on in the hotel but amazingly you can't hear anything in your room which I was very surprised at.Everything about the hotel is pretty amazing the only things I didn't think was 100% great was the maid and the extra charge you get when cheking in. Obv you have to leave tips so we left $2 everyday but all the maid did was make the bed and ocassionally changed the towels, obv that might me being petty but she left the bin overflow, didn't Hoover, didn't tidy up etc we didn't destroy the hotel room or anything but giving $2 a day for the bed being made just seems alot to me.And when we checked in we were charged $70 for getting 2 tiny bottles of water a day and a newspaper everyday, not everyday we were given waters or newspapers but couldn't be bothered to moan about.It's obv right at the beginning of the strip so getting the deuce (bus) us a must and a 24hrs ticket is only $7. But overall the hotel is amazing.	
Oct 26 2009 	Eh... Disappointing	I expected more from this hotel, but the only thing it really has going for it is the cool architecture. The rooms are falling apart (although they are big). Service was nothing great. The layout of the hotel is hard to get used to. I didn't find out there was a food court until the day I left. Location isn't that great eigther. The pool was pathetic and mostly closed off. Basically it's right at the end of the strip. Stay at new York new York. It's more fun and nicer. Or circus circus if you have a family. That place was cool.	
Oct 26 2009 	Vegas Baby!!	I loved the Luxor hotel, we stayed in the pyramid as opposed to the tower. Our rooms were on about the 4th floor and we were warned when checking in that it could be noisy! We had complimentary upgrades to suites which meant that as the suites were in the pyramid corners and we had 2 rooms that we were in one corner and our friends in another, which did prove a bit akward at times, but overall was fine. Our room was relatively quiet, but our friends overlooked the pool...and they had an all night pool party outside, which they couldn't sleep through-not good! The rooms were huge and had everything you needed, even a hot tub, but the hotel really does need a revamp as its getting a bit tired now.The staff were really helpful and friendly, but the travellators in the hotel sometimes took forever, which got really annoying.The location is ok, but its a bit of a walk to the monorail which starts at the MGM Grand across the street. We tried walking from the Luxor to the other end of the strip and didn't manage it in one day as after so many detours into shops and hotels we were knackered!I would recommend Vegas though, it's big and brash and totally fake. Just the kind of place to escape the real world to!P.S. Would highly recommend the helicopter ride over the Grand Canyon with a champagne picnic-it's a must!!	
Oct 26 2009	Loved it	I stayed in the Luxor with family for 5 days in the east tower and i beleive that the hotel was perfect for our trip. It was situated in the right place, with a deuce bus stop over the road and located near the best hotels on the strip in my opinion. our room was lovely with a great view , granted there were probably better views available but we didn't have a problem with it. All the amenities worked well and we did't have one problem with the room. i was concerned about the $10.95 charge to the room for each day for two bottles of water in the bathroom and the paper that was delivered each day, however when i got to check out there was no charge.the one key thing i believe you should do when checking in at the hotel (and yes there was a short wait at the desk but that was because there were 35 other groups/families checking in also with 8 clerks on the desks - the wait was justified)is don't leave a creadit card. this is where they add all the extra charges when you check out. checking out wasn't a problem either, even at 4.30 in the morning. overall i would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to stay in Las Vegas.	
Oct 26 2009 	Living like a Pharao	Only stayed there for one night, but it was one of the best hotel rooms I've ever been to and not even that expensive (seeing the famousness of the hotel itself).Big room, great interiour, astonishing view, and very good location on the strip.	
Oct 26 2009 	Great hotel....amazing city	We upgraded to one of the rooms in the west tower, after being given a twin room by mistake (on honeymoon??!!) so we seen both types of rooms. It was only $20 dollars extra a night to upgrade to this larger, much more modern, cleaner and overall better room. I am soooo glad we did!The hotel itself is fantastic i would go back! The casino, bars, food is amazing.We tried the cafe late one night i had chicken pie was yummy, the buffet had amazing choice!Only thing i was not pleased with...the waitress service was not as good in the casino area as all the other hotels we visited for the casino.We went and seen penn and teller while there at the rio..great! Did the sunset champagne grand canyon tour....definite must!	
Oct 25 2009 	Not bad but not really good either	So the Luxor presents a conundrum for me - it's not a bad place, but it's not where I want to stay again. It has good prices for an MGM property on the Strip- I paid $120/night for Fri. and Sat. It offers more than a budget hotel, but it's not posh, and there is nothing very special about it (save the inclinators). The casino seems to be in the middle of an identity crisis - are they ditching the Egyptian theme? It's rather odd.I stayed in a Tower room. This is not in the main pyramid, but an addition on the west side.Pros: Good strip location, easy access to Mandalay Bay and Excalibur. Full service casino, good force -out poker tournaments. Rooms were reasonable size, bathroom was large, with a lot of counter-top real estate, separate tub, and shower with a good adjustable shower head. Towels were fine, bathroom looked clean. Lots of drawer and closet space. Staff was really friendly and helpful. Three Starbucks locations in the middle of the casino for all you coffee drinkers. Cons: Long walk from the casino floor to the tower rooms. Rooms have no fridge, minibar, or in-room safe. Rooms are very dark - not a lot of natural or room lighting. The beds are horrible - they are what I expect to find in an old motel - and in need of a serious upgrade. Bed linens were not soft, pillows are old and lumpy. Carpet needs to be replaced. They ding you with a $10.95 &quot;resort fee&quot; that with tax comes to almost $15 - for a newspaper. Parking garage is poorly designed and you can only access it via the Strip.Other: Did not go to LAX, but you can get in with no cover using your room key. Cathouse is ridiculous - little tiny portions at high prices. Skip the food and stick with cocktails. Did not use any of the other restaurants. There is a food court with a lot of fast food options. The 24-hour convenience store has very limited stock. Pool is nothing special, and has barely any shade areas. In summary, it's a Strip hotel with a good location and cheap rates. Just be sure to calculate the extra $15 fee when making your decision.	
Oct 25 2009 	Brilliant!!!	We loved our trip to Las Vegas, its like no other place on earth, absolutely amazing! We found the Luxor to be a great hotel and base to explore Vegas. Although the location means a fair walk up the strip this did not really bother us as there is plenty to see and do along the way Our room, a tower deluxe was a good size with huge bed, clean and had a nice pool view. A safety deposit box in our room and tea and coffee making facilities would have been appreciated though. We ate at the food court, pyramid café and buffet. We could not fault the pyramid café or buffet, good service and excellent food. We did, however find the food court at the Excalibur next door to have a better variety. The 24hr star bucks came in handy as did the ice machine and cold drink vendor on our floor. All the staff were polite, friendly and helpful, in fact we found everyone in Vegas to be very welcoming. The pool area was clean with towels provided and there is a good choice of shopping. We would definitely go back to the Luxor in the future but will probably consider a more central hotel for our next trip to Vegas. Overall we really enjoyed our stay at the Luxor and cant wait to back to Vegas!!!	
Oct 25 2009 	Good but unnecessary "resort fee"	The hotel/casino itself was fine, nice big rooms, clean, quiet, etc. But I was miffed to be charged an additional $12 per day ($36 for the 3 days we were there) &quot;resort fee&quot; on top of the roomrate (with no indication we'd be charged this when we booked online.This got us 2 bottles of water per day, unlimited local and long distance phone calls, use of the fitness center and a $25 food/drink voucher. Bu we didn't need/want any of these services, and there was no option to decline. We used the food vouchers, just to get something back, but we probably would have eaten elsewhere if we didn't have the vouchers. And this fee didn't even get you Internet access... I would much rather have that than phonecalls.But in their favor, I think all the vegas hotels are charging a similar fee.	
Oct 25 2009 	Great time in Vegas	My husband and I had never been to Vegas before. We stayed at the Luxor and also got married while we were there at the Shalimar Wedding Chapel. I just wish our time in Vegas had been longer. We had a great time. The Luxor is a great hotel with wonderful service. We ate at the Aureole at Mandalay Bay after our wedding and I believe it was the best food I have ever had in my life. We can't wait to go back!	
Oct 24 2009 	almost perfect	stayed in the luxor from oct 19th to the 23rdim not sure why all the bad reviews, as i read more and more dad ones i was somewhat concerned.well if you are thinking of booking or have already , do not concern yourselfthe hotel was cleanthe staff friendly the food was goodmy washroom had a reworked shower stall with teracotta ceramic tile.did i have a plasma tv , no , but who cares i didnt go there to watch tvthe pool was greati tried to find the problems others looked forthey do not exsist, i was in the pyramin , and would gladly stay again	
Oct 24 2009 	Every thing is here	Came here for a conference. Its connected to Mandalay by a mini mall. Lots of good choices for restarants, clubs, shopping, bars. The check in staff at 2 pm sucked. Rude, treated you like cattle. Check out staff at 5 am was great. Is it the hours maybe ?Every one else that worked here was great. Stayed in the east tower which was nicer than the pyramid rooms. My co worker stayed in the pyramid room and I was not too impressed. My room was great in the east tower but a long walk longer to the cassino. Place is huge so be ready to walk. Also, it is at the very south end of the strip. So if you want to walk out and be were the action is, it is about a 1/4 mile walk.	
Oct 23 2009 	Dark and shabby	Hotel is very dark- no natural light. That is how the casinos are, sure, but it is a bummer that the rooms hardly get any light and the windows don't open. No Wifi, only wired internet access, so don't expect your iPhone to use Wifi.Carpets and walls are dingy and run down. room was clean. No tub, only a shower. Takes forever to walk down the halls. Smells like cigarette smoke everywhere. Just a depressing place to stay. The casino seems pretty low end compared with some others.The only thing that redeemed this hotel was the swimming pool, which is large and hardly used. You can definitely get some good laps in.	
Oct 23 2009 	Dated	Dated, check-in line was massive so we went to the more up-market side of the hotel to check-in which made the woman on the counter grumpy. They run a system where you give your bags to the porter and theyre supposed to arrive at your room 20 minutes after walking through the door, I waited over an hour. If you travel light, carry your own bags up stairs, its not worth the hassle. Pyramid rooms are dated but I suppose you pay for what you get. Its a very family friendly hotel; I opted to move to THEhotel at Mandalay bay.	
Oct 23 2009 	Never Ever Again...........	I just returned home from five days / four nights at the Luxor in Vegas. Stayed in the East Tower on the 18th floor - room 338. It's on an inside corner and had a great view, but that's about it. I was extremely disappointed in the hotel as a whole. It took 20 minutes to check in, my network cord was missing the tab so wouldn't stay in my computer, the toilet lid would not stay up - as a man that's incredibly frustrating having to hold the ring up - makes me want to just...........but I didn't!!! The room was clean, but it was just a basic hotel room with Egyptian pictures. Definitely not impressed. I had to use the business center - what a joke. You have to buy an internet card to (for example) print a boarding. The minimum purchase is $5. I had two minutes left on my card and only needed to print one page - which is $1 and should have worked - it said I did not have enough credit on the card to continue. When I asked the person at the counter she said it's not their issue - they only sell the cards - I'd have to call customer service to get it straightened out. Definitely not my idea of a luxury hotel.It only takes a few things to give a sour note - I will not stay there again.Oh, and I almost forgot - there's a furnace type thing in the room I stayed in - which provided a great opportunity for me to hear everything that was going on in the next room - at 1:00 in the morning. I do not need to hear teenagers arguing and screaming with their parents when I'm trying to sleep - I actually thought they were somehow in my room - that's how clear I could hear them.	
Oct 22 2009 	WE LOVE VEGAS	Loved the Luxor! Great staff, great food... and even won a little money!	
Oct 22 2009 	Luxor unclear what they are trying to be but too many sloppy loose ends I wont return	This was a last minute business trip for from my home in Newport Beach, California. to Las Vegas, a 46 minute plane rige or a 3 1/2 ---4 hour car ride..Upon entering the triangular monolithic pyramid I first overheard an employee telling a guest that all photography was prohibited. First beef: The layout is very very confusing, to say the least/ To get to my elevators in the east tower, I would go throiugh a series of tiny, low doors, and tranverse winding halls that seemed to randomly wind around.My coworkers made the same remarks when asked what they thought about the hotel.Second beef: the rooms were just OK, some granite counter tops, nice and clean. They give you 2 little bottles of water and throw a USA Today in the morning. For that you are charged $13 resort fee. Third beef : The beef itself. We first considered the Buffet, but it looked very institutional, did not smell inviting. Plus although the hotel was pretty busy, the Bufffet was completely empty of diners so we decided not to risk it, since we were not starving anyway. That being the case, we went to the fancy schmsncy steak place in the casino called Tender Steak house.Everything was described as the ultimate gastrnomic gourmet stuff. We ordered the l gourmet cheese tasting plate and from a list of a dozen or so &quot;artisan&quot; cheese, chose three.AMERICAN ARTISANAL AND FARMHOUSE CHEESES 3 for 16 | 5 for 24fresh baguettes, honeycomb, fresh dates, quince paste and cherry fig chutneyThe dish arrived on a slate shingle featuring 3 tiny pieces of cheese, some thin sliced pieces of bread, 3 dates, a glorp of orange marmalade, and few walnut, for about $20. By the way, I aske the lovely young waitperson how to say the word &quot;artisanal&quot; and she kind of twisted and sputtered. She finally admitted that she didnt know how to say it and I told her neither I nor my son could say it either, We all got a good laugh out of that ,, but our lauhing was soon stooped by the $40 8oz angus grass feed steak that we were going to split (remember, we werent that hungry) It arrived 1/2 hour later and the ourside of the steak was cold...not room temperature, but cold. The inside of the steak was warm,, but overall tasteless and poorly done. We each had one bite and that was enough. When she asked about it we told her those comlaints. When she asked itf we wanted another, we declined (i never send back a steak...to many times the chef will give out a &quot;special steak&quot; that has fallen on the floor or that has wiped his nether regions....you get my point.]]Well the manager cameover and would take the steak off the bill, but comped me 2 glassses of overpriv=ced $12pinot noir. The coke refills on my sone were $3.50 each.So ourr $110 consisted each of 1/1/2 scraps of AMERICAN ARTISANAL AND FARMHOUSE CHEESES , a bit of cold tastelss steak, and some overy sweet baby carrots.. It is a mediocre restaurant trying to be gourmet and high end and missing by a mile. Wont be going back thee.The casino didnt have a very good vibe, but it could have been because it was TUesday. One crap table, but 5 out of 6 players were smoking.I normally stay and enjoy Bellagio 5 or 6 times a year, or the Wynn, 2-3 times per year. Neither of them are perfect, but you know what to expect and you get consistency, Many of the emplyees there have beent here foreever..Dorothy at the front bar, Brian at te spots book bar,....Makes it feel more like a privateclub than a hotelIn summary, the Luxor kind of sucked with the wrong fung shui.	
Oct 21 2009 	One of the worst hotels I have ever stayed in....	Luxor Hotel - classed as a 4 star hotel on the Las Vegas strip! Dont beleive it! If you are not bothered about room comforts and enjoy nothing more than a dirty hotel full of drunken hen and stag parties this is the place for you. If like me you expect much more from a 4 star hotel avoid it like the plague! We arrived for a 3 night stay at the Luxor on 3rd October and following an extremely long and delayed flight from the UK we could have done without all the poor service and hassle we received upon check in. We had to queue 20 minutes at check in, receptionist was not terribly welcoming or friendly and only to be advised there was no-one to assist with the bags and just pointed in the direction of the room. The room was on the 19th floor furthest away from the lift and felt like it had not been used for years. The floor was dirty and covered in someone's pill medication, thick dust on the furniture and sofa! We immediately called reception to ask to be moved, we were advised the hotel was full and they only had one other &quot;suite&quot; available on the ground floor. Back to reception to join the queue again to get the new room keys. Still no bell boy... and again pointed in the direction of the room. However we spent 40 minutes trying to find it.. we asked 4 members of staff the location of the room and all gave us different directions to find it, in a packed drunken casino on a Saturday night it all got too much and resulted in tears. Eventually after returning to the reception desk and queueing AGAIN someone finally located our room. Clean but the size of a shoe box and no view! We checked out the very next morning and the receptionist seemed surprised as to our early departure.. staying there would have totally ruined my holiday. This at best is a 3 star hotel... I would never stay here again, nor would I recommend this to my friends. We relocated to the Bellagio..... pure heaven!	
Oct 21 2009 	Luxor Needs a Facelift.....	The location of the hotel is great and so are the personnel and staff. The rooms and the hotel, however, are really in dire need of some renovations. The most annoying thing is the one elevator for each floor--basically, you must walk around the entire pyramid to find the one elevator. If you have a special needs person, you may want to rethink your stay. The ambiance is dark and therefore feels somewhat old and musty. Plus, it was disappointing that no coffee maker, no refrig., toilet was hard to flush and the sink got stopped up.	
Oct 21 2009 	luxor las vegas	the luxor is a massive hotel as they all are in vegas rooms a little bit tired but you dont spend much time in them they were a good size but no coffee making facilities in the pyramid rooms the luxor is sittiated at one end of the strip so if you want a more central location go for another hotel our stay there was a very pleasent one	
Oct 20 2009 	Okay but there's much better...	... IF you care about the room. We ended up spending time alone in our room -- more than we expected. So next time, we'll stay at a prettier hotel. We picked Luxor because we thought it would be cool and while the lobby and the area near the East Tower were kind of neat, the rooms were more tacky 80's decor intermingled with marble, you know, for that Egypian feel... The rooms were clean. They were just dingy and a bit all-around icky. We were &quot;upgraded&quot; to the East Tower, and again, while it was not awful, I am concerned about the other rooms in the hotel as this in no way felt like an upgrade ;) The walls are very thin, too. We learned they do not have good TV channels because we had to sleep with the TV on only so we didn't have to hear other couples around us doing their &quot;couple&quot; duties, if you catch my drift ;)We stayed in the cheap rooms so I can't speak for the fancy ones if they exist, but there are no mini-fridges/bars, no snackies to be had, no coffee maker. We were fine with all of that as we are not only coffee snobs but booze snobs and expected to spend way too much on our drinking luxuries there. Some may find this intolerable. The staff was generally nice and polite. We only had one negative (and miserable!) experience, but I am not using it to grade the hotel as a whole like too many people do on their reviews. With this said, be sure to eyeball your bill when you check out. We traveled with another couple and a staff member had given them a coupon booklet with 4 free coupons to the buffet, More. This apparently was a catastrophic mistake on their part. We ended up using the coupons for one lunch and didn't think anything of it until we saw we were charged for the meal ($71 for 2 people!!) We believe the booklet our friends were given was for some all-inclusive package. I didn't even know they had one, and this is all speculation as the staff is so secretive about these coupons that none of us know what to think even still! Anyway, 40 minutes of arguing ethics with people who just do not care, they comped us. Problem solved. We just felt their management was grossly inappropriate for not owning up to a mistake THEY made. Aside from that one experience, the hotel was okay. Decent, I dare say, but I'd prefer to spend the money and stay somewhere nicer ONLY because we ended up spending more time in the room than we expected.One last thing, and I think this applies to all hotels out there, but they charge a daily resort fee of $13 (after tax) to give you 2 teeny bottles of water and a bad newspaper every day. So after the airline nickle and dimes you, expect your hotel to do the same :)	
Oct 20 2009 	Comfortable stay in pyramid	I was a little concerned after reading reviews but the truth is our stay was very enjoyable even though the rooms do need some updating. We stayed in the pyramid (again) which was very clean and the bed was really comfortable. Probably would stay mid-strip if we return to Vegas but wanted to be near the Mandalay Bay Hotel for the Barrett-Jackson car auction which was held next door. Seven days is more than needed in Vegas as we would have found out if 4 days hadn't been taken up by the car auction. The casino is terribly smokey as there are no restrictions. Could be the air isn't filtered as much as some of the other high end casinos, ie. The Wynn and Caesars. Food is expensive in Vegas and found even the snacks at Walgreens and CVS outrageous in price. Not the same prices as in their other stores, but convenient - right on the strip. Lack of coffee machines in hotels force you to go to Starbucks which are abundant in the hotels and pay double the price. All in all, a good time was had. Take the new double decker open roofed sightseeing bus which is hop on and off for 2 days - about $34 each - well worth the evening tour which lasts about 2 hours if you take the full run at once.	
Oct 20 2009 	Pretty good for the money!	I did have some reservations about booking this hotel after reading other reviews on here, but the price was right so I went ahead with it. I was definitely pleasantly surprised. Check-in was smooth - no waiting at all. They did ask if we wanted to upgrade to a Tower room for $20 more a night. No thanks. I don't really understand why they ask you this. If I wanted a Tower room, I would've booked it when I booked my Pyramid room months ago. Oh well. We ended up with a Pyramid room on the 14th floor with a really good view of the Palms hotel area. The hotel is really cool - I loved the pyramid theme and the huge atrium. It does take awhile to get oriented though and it can be very difficult to find the correct elevator. The room was spacious and standard. No frills but if I wanted frills, I'd choose somewhere more expensive to stay. The downside is definitely that the Luxor is on the end of the strip so lots of walking is involved. But I knew that going into it. On the other hand, it was nice to be away from the madness. The cab line at Bellagio was probably an hour long but at Luxor you get one right away. I guess it just depends on what's important to you. One odd thing was when we got to our room after check-in, there was a bottle of lotion on the bathroom floor and toilet paper in the toilet which made me wonder about housekeeping? But we were too tired to complain so we stayed. The maid service was outstanding the rest of the trip, so maybe that was just a fluke. I'd read on here that the beds were uncomfortable but did not find that to be the case. I slept great! I also read the air conditioning is lacking but once again, not so! Our room was always kept frigidly cold, thanks to my hot-natured boyfriend. And I read that the hotel is smokey and once again, did not find this to be the case. Our non-smoking room had no smell whatsoever, and even the casino seemed fairly non-smokey. Once slight complaint: Even if you book a certain room ahead of time, the Luxor can't guarantee to accommodate your request which I don't quite understand since every other hotel can. Our non-smoking request was honored but we were given 2 queen beds instead of one king. Once again, we were too tired to argue and it really didn't matter. We just used the second bed to pile clothes on. It's nice that Luxor is connected to Excalibur and Mandalay Bay, because it gives you more gambling, eating, and shopping options. Loved the Burger Bar in Mandalay Place -best burger I've ever eaten, hands down. Mix on top of Mandalay is also great for a drink and music - you can't beat the view. People complain about the timeshare sellers, and they ARE annoying, but just ignore them and they'll leave you alone. But they have them at most hotels, so it's not a Luxor annoyance, just a Vegas annoyance in general. Would I recommend the Luxor to someone on a budget? Absolutely. I have no real complaints with the place. I probably wouldn't stay here again just because I'd want to try somewhere new and it would be nice to be closer to the center of the strip. But all in all, it's a good hotel. If you're not looking for fancy-schmancy, you'll like the Luxor.	
Oct 20 2009 	Fantastic hotel	We got a room here for am absolute bargain rate - about $60 a night. Parking was easy, check in a breeze. The room was a little faded in parts, but was large, clean and had a great view. The pyramid was a destination itself and heaps of fun to stay in (although people prone to vertigo should probably chose the tower instead). The pools are incredible, and access to the very satisfactory fitness center is included in the price. We walked to the other hotels and strip locations without any problems. Great hotel, great value. Highly recommended.	
Oct 19 2009 	Perfect for what we wanted!	Had a 4 night stay here at the beginning of October. Check in was very quick and the staff were polite. We were on the 20th floor and had a great view of the excalibur and surrounding hills. Rooms are very clean and spacious and the maid does a great job, particuly like the power shower in the bathroom. Hotel is not in the centre of the strip it is at the airport end, however this was only about a 20/30 minute walk to the centre of the strip. The longest part of the walk is getting out of the hotel as it is so huge, but having looked at the other hotels i would imagine this is the same for most properties. Can't comment on the shows i'm afraid. Pool area was clean and had a great chilled out vibe, was never very busy.Great atmospshere in the bars and restaurants. Would recommend for a stay in Vegas, but to be honest you spend hardly any time in your room....so don't read to much into peoples rants on the hotels.	
Oct 19 2009 	Okay but not great	We chose this hotel as we fancied staying in a pyramid as a novelty - on that basis I guess we should have expected it to be dark and quite oppressive inside and it was. The rooms are spacious but pretty basic and in need of attention - likewise the common areas - no fridge or drinks facilities in the room - which I found really odd in a hotel of that standard. No safe in the room either; safe deposit is available at reception but given the size of the hotel and the fact it took 20 minutes to get to your room; not terribly practical. (They do need more direction signs too - the place is vast!)The buffet restaurant was excellent and the staff very good.Also went to the Titanic exhibition which was excellent, if a little pricey.I liked the location as it encouraged us to see the whole 'Strip' but you do spend a reasonable amount of time and money either walking or in cabs; so if you're only in Veags for a short while a more central location might be a better option.	
Oct 19 2009 	Had a great stay	I have just got back from a week's stay at the Luxor. Like many people I was a little apprehensive about the place after reading some of the negative reviews on here. But I had a wonderful stay. We had a room on the 20th floor in the West Tower. The room was big, spotlessly clean and had a large bathroom with both a separate bath and shower. And the beds were extremely comfortable. We used the Tower check-in (thanks to previous posters for this tip!); there wasn't a single person in the queue when we arrived. We ate at the buffet a couple of times - it was ok. Location wise, yeah it is at the southern end of the Strip but we really didn't find this to be much of a problem. It only took about 5 minutes to walk through the Excalibur and you were out at New York, New York. There is also a Deuce bus stop outside the hotel. However, we found the bus to be painfully slow and for shorter trips up the Strip we found it quicker to walk. The drinks service in the casino was excellent. Any time I was there the cocktail waitresses swung by at least every 15 minutes. I would definitely recommend The Luxor without hesitation.	
Oct 18 2009 	Almost perfect	To me, this is the perfect combination of hotel and casino - - with the immense vaulted atrium of Luxor, one never feels closed in by people, games, or noise. Its located at the end of The Strip nearest the airport, making getting to and from the hotel on arrival and departure a breeze. Also, being between Mandalay and Excalibur one has the full range of food options to choose from - Krispy Kreme to rm seafood.The only reason I am not giving a perfect score of 5 is that upon our arrival we were swooped upon by a casino rep who proceeded to suck us into a spiel about taking a tour of a timeshare in order to earn $125 in vouchers.I never want to start a vacation in confrontation, but this really put a stink on my arrival. Aside from this, and forewarned is forearmed, I cannot recommend Luxor highly enough	
Oct 18 2009 	very nice	I stay in a pryrimid room and was worried as i had read some bad reveiws. Firstly the maid service was great my brother left $1500 in the room accidently we thought it was going to have been taking by the time we got back far from it the maid had laid it on the side cabinet and it was all accounted for. the rooms were cleaned every day about one they were cleaned to a exelant standed as my brother and i have left it in a terrible state. the casino at the luxor has table games starting at $10 and slots at 1cent a line as we were table game fans we went to excalber which had games from $5, as a word of advice if you are going to bet join there players club and always use your card we accured $150 comp dollors which paid for a colple of meals. the buffet at the luxer was priced at $30 all day $13.99 breakfast $14.99 lunch $15.99 dinner breakfeat and dinner were there best meal. the only bad thing about this hotel is its location compared to the rest of the strip it was taking us 48 mins to walk to the falmingo at a fastish pace however there was a bbus stop right near by with buses running every 15 mins the bus cost $7 for 24 hours worth of transit which was goood value	
Oct 17 2009 	The Luxor is so Amazing	The Luxor is so hugh that for first timers, we spent almost a hour just looking for the right elevator to our room. They sure could use more in house signs for directions. Everyone was willing to help but I think more signs would help. The More Buffet was the best place we ate during our four night stay and very affordable. That was a great deal for $30.00 you can ate all day and the selections were very tasty.	
Oct 17 2009 	IT'S A SHAME	This WAS a great hotel and casino until MGM Corp. bought it. ........................ Now the rooms are run-down, check-in is a big hassles(wait in line in a maze), and the casino is so chopped up, it's no fun. I will not be going back to the Luxor.	
Oct 17 2009 	wonderful trip	Hotel needs to be updated but all in all it was clean, comfortable, and the service was great. We had a great time and the comps were over the top. I think if the rooms get some new linens and rugs and the common places get some new carpeting, this hotel would be right up there with the best. We would most certainly go back.	
Oct 15 2009 	Good... Maybe could be better...	We stayed at this hotel to visit Las Vegas and see some shows. The room was ok for the price we paid, elevators need an update!!! They feel as if they were gonna drop you! Buffet was excellent! Front Office staff said we had an upgrade but uh-uh they were bluffing!! They were out of rooms for when we got there and they downgraded us!!! But I spoke and by the next day we had our room! It was perfect!Hotels shouldn't overbooked because people like meeeee, then talk about it!The hotel was excellent! Nearby areas good, fast food close... variaty of attractions close... Enjoy your vacation!	
Oct 15 2009 	You really do get what you pay for	There's a reason the Luxor gives away it's rooms for as low as $38 per night. The hotel rooms are in serious need of a make over. The Luxor is not four star, probably three. I arrived late Sunday night and tipped the clerk at the front $20 for a nice room. I wound up in the west tower (by the spa and pool). The bathroom shower was moldy and the lovely brass fixtures were crusty, cracked tiles, the outlet in the bathroom did not work, the bed spread was stained, someone's dirty socks and brochures were in the drawer in the armoir, etc. When I complained the next morning the clerk put me in a tower suite which was still showing its age. Also, like other reviews here have pointed out, the beds are thin and not luxurous and plush, bedding needs to be updated, and some the furniture is worn. Staff was overall friendly. The morning I was upgraded I was also solicited in the lobby walking back to the elevators from someone who wanted to give me a &quot;massage.&quot; But I'm sure this happens in a lot of Vegas hotels.All-in-all when you pay $38 for a hotel room, don't expect anything more than a $38 room. My advise is to pay a little extra and stay at one of the new properties on the strip.	
Oct 14 2009 	in need of an update	We stayed 2 nights at the Luxor on a comp promotion. There is a reason why they paid us to stay! MGM should be embarassed how they have let this hotel go. There is NO luxury here. I have stayed at pretty much all the MGM hotels and this is by far the most run down and need in complete refurbishment. The carpets are worn, the bed springs poke through and almost everything is in need of new paint and decor. I would not recommend this hotel until they refurbish.	
Oct 14 2009 	An OK stay on the Strip with a few reservations......	I am not a Vegas type traveler, and came to town for a friend's wedding out in the desert, which was a good time. The design of the hotel intrigued me, so that is why i decided to stay on the Strip the first time. Overall, I was fairly pleased, but not overwhelmed by my three nights there, and would probably opt for somewhere else next time. I have read some of the other's negative remarks, but I will be more positive. Certainly the employees were generally a good and helpful bunch. My room. in the Pyramid, up on the `15th floor, was certainly not a dump and I liked its spaciousness. There were no stains and it was quite clean. I would expect to find coffee in a hotel like this. The $14.99 per day for Internet is a ripoff. The hallways looked a little shabby with peeling wallpaper and the elevators were temperamental and showed signs of heavy use. The pool area is large and attractive, but looks rather old - for 15 years? Being a person who likes classical music and good jazz, I find offensive the crappy raucous rock music played all over Vegas. Apparently, this is what the clientele likes. I did have a very nice chair massage at the pool and the young man who worked on me agreed that the stupid music is not conducive to a massage or relaxing. I did enjoy the &quot; Bodies &quot; and &quot; Titanic &quot; exhibitions, which were like visiting a museum, except that the combined price for the two of them with audio tours came to $52!	
Oct 14 2009 	Get married at the Luxor but don't honeymoon there.	We were recently married at the Luxor. The chapel was fabulous, the ladies were so helpful to me and the jacuzzi suite we stayed in on our wedding night was stunning. The photos were also beautiful. However, if we had it to do over again we would book the rest of our stay somewhere else. Our regular room was certainly not worth what we paid for it. Basic ammenities that you would find in any Motel 6 were not in the room and would have cost extra. For example a pot of coffee was $13, when most rooms give you your own coffee maker. It would have cost $15 a day to have a fridge in our room and we acutally had to call the front desk to get a phone book. I would recommend to anyone who wants a wonderful Vegas wedding that you will never forget, do so at the Luxor. But I would also tell them to make sure they stay somewhere else the rest of the honeymoon.	
Oct 13 2009 	Vegas with my 3 year old	I didn't know if it would be a good idea to take my 3 year old son to sin city for our family vacation but i was wrong, we had so much fun and Vegas is ok for kids.We stayed at the Luxor and enjoyed it very much, we spent most of the days at the pool and walked the strip at night. We ate at the buffet restaurant at the hotel and the food was good ,no complaints there. On our last day we took a ride to Red Rock Mountain and it was a great experience away from the neon lights.	
Oct 13 2009 	Well worth the price	Quite a nice option if you are 'on a budget' in Las Vegas, well worth the money. Check their web-site before booking as there's an array of 'special offers'.	
Oct 12 2009 	Best Time Of Our Lives	Our trip was for our 5 year anniversary and we went all out. UFC 100 was the reason we chose to go in July. Floor tickets to UFC 100, Fan Expo VIP and We got a great deal at the Luxor for 6days. Our Suite was great...so much room and the spa was a wonderful way to relax before we hit the town at night. The View...I can't begin to describe what a wonderful view we had during the day as well as night. Thanks again	
Oct 12 2009 	First and last time	First time staying at the hotel and will never stay again. The rooms were dirty looking and not updated at all. My bathroom door had pen marks all over the front and back. The bathroom only had a shower and visible mold was noted on the tile. We told at check in that we have a daily $10 fee for two bottles of water (4 oz each) and the daily paper--whether we wanted them or not! Internet access woud have been $15/dayThe only good thing about the hotel was the vallet guys as they were very curteous and fast.	
Oct 12 2009 	4 star hotel but 2 star feel	This hotel is awful. We had pen markings all over the door. Gum stuck on the side of the bed frame, the remote taped together. The hotel has not been renovated in 16 years (per Luxor employee). There was mildew in the showers and the grout was peeling. It was disgusting. They also charge an extra 11 dollars a day for 2 very small bottles of water and a news paper. This is a MANDATORY charge whether you want it or not. I've stayed in a nicer rooms at Howard Johnson. The buffet was overpriced and not good. They mandated the charge for mimosa's whether you drink them or not. When I complained to management they completely disregarded me. They are very lucky that I had booked with priceline and no refunds were allowed. It seem forever to get to other casinos its really not even on the main strip. I was there with 3 other friends and their rooms was just as disgusting as ours. This is awful! Don't waste your money or your time. The casino smelled like smoke. I always say that you know if its a classy or good casino if you can't walk away from the smoke. Meaning they spent very little on the ventiliation system. AWFUL~AWFUL~AWFUL!!! I took pictures of the nastiness. SO if are management at the LUXOR--take note.. I will post them up soon!.. I just got back last night. If the hotel was nicer and the staff more courtous, I would've stayed the extra night for 50 bucks. But I think 50 bucks is too much for the room type.	
Oct 12 2009 	Can't go wrong for the price!-clean and spacious	We stayed at the Luxor for our 2nd time from September 23rd for 5 days. Our last stay was excellent value for money but looking at the latest reviews I was beginning to get worried as Luxor doesnt get a good name! However the bad reviews were nothing that we encountered! We booked a standard pyramid room for around $320 for 5 days including a weekend so it was really cheap. The check in line was non-existent when we arrived on a Wednesday afternoon at 2pm, we got checked in and after a few discussions and a $20 bill, got upgraded to a West Tower room which is what we wanted. It was a lot more modern and updated than the pyramid rooms and easy to locate at the back of the casino by the pool. We got a King Size non-smoking. Our view was pretty dismal but we werent worried by that as we were moving hotels after day 5. The bed was really comfy as I slept really well! Our friends on the same floor had a good view over the pool. Our floor was very quiet and because were not over the atrium in the tower you cant hear any casino noise at all. Just like last time, the hotel room was very clean, bed was made every day and the bathroom and towels were cleaned and changed. We got the resort fee waived as we checked out but we got 2 mini bottles of water every day &amp; a paper which were very welcome. The pool area was very good, large and always beds free. Lots of palm trees for shade and music wasnt too loud. Towels were freely available as you showed your room key. You cant beat Luxor for value, the tram between Excalibur and Mandalay Bay is very useful. It is far down the strip but we didnt mind walking or getting taxis as it was hot when we went. Its convenient for MGM and NYNY.I find the casino friendly, not too large and easy to navigate, we didnt eat there but did drink in Aurora and Liquid. The Aurora Bar near check in is a great place to have a few quiet drinks.We would definitely stay again!	
Oct 12 2009 	Needs Refurbishing	Stayed in Pyramid. Rooms are old, tired and dirty. They need refurbishing. Buffet salad bar was under construction, but, we weren't told until after we had payed full price. Pool had green algae and the music was loud making it difficult to relax. Rooms were inexpensive and now we know why. We won't be returning to that hotel.	
Oct 12 2009 	Excellent value	Stayed for 2 nights in September in a Pyramid room. It was large, comfortable and clean and didn't feel outdated to us. It was the cheapest hotel room of our month-long trip and probably the largest and one of the nicest. The buffet downstairs is very good value with an amazing selection of food. Pyramid cafe wasn't good - bad service, average food and so cold we shivered through our meal. We used the free tram service and the shuttle bus to get around and walked through to the Manderlay next door. Saw an amazing production of the Lion King in the theatre there.	
Oct 11 2009 	dirty smelly rooms and rude staff	we booked to stay here 5 months before we arrived. we are international travellers.Upon arrival, we waited over 1 hr to check in because bloody britany spears was playing at the mandalay, they gave us smoking rooms we didnt want or pay for because they were booked out. the rooms stunk of cigarette and cigars. found a dirty ashtray under the quilt beside the bed and a half smoked cigar behind the smelly curtains. then they took an extra $1000 out of my credit card for &quot;incidentals&quot; for the 5 days and made me pay $12.50 per day for the las vegas paper that i dont read. upon check out they couldnt haver cared less about our complaints. just said &quot;oh well&quot;....never again.	
Oct 11 2009 	Really good stay	This hotel had great service, everyone was very nice which made it enjoyable. The room was big, comfortable and clean, no minifridge and the sink goodies were only shampoo/conditioner/hand lotion. Bathroom is huge and clean with large mirror. The casino there was big and affordable, and three pools were perfect - just what you'd expect from a good Vegas trip.	
Oct 11 2009 	Rooms need updating not a great location	We were disappointed while staying at the Luxor. Expected more upscale rooms, they were &quot;tired.&quot; Pool nice, could use more &quot;shade&quot; for those of us who are not sun worshippers.	
Oct 10 2009 	16th Bday trip for son	My son and I found the Luxor a great place to stay. The dark decor and Egyptian theme was fun for my teenage son and brought a bit of mystery and class to the experience, compared to the Disney feel of the Excalibur. We got great buys on the room in the pyramid and they proved to be quiet when we wanted them to be. We walked to the Mandalay Bay seafood buffet and took the tram to the Excalibur then walked to the MGM for the David Copperfield show and the NY NY roller coaster. Neither of us understood the negative comments about the condition of the rooms. The only thing I saw was a inch of peeling paint at the floor next to the shower. We spent hours at the Titanic exhibit, very well done and a nice change of pace.	
Oct 10 2009 	We were horrified by the condition of the Pyramid Room.	We booked a &quot;pyramid deluxe room&quot; and I was absolutely horrified at the condition of this room. The carpet has stain upon stain, there were large,dark stains on the bedspread and the shower stall was disgusting. I would have taken pictures but the room was unbelievable dark. We returned to the lobby and saw the manager on duty and she pretty much said &quot;too bad&quot; until my husband asked to see her manager and then all of the sudden she found an available Tower Room which was very nice and we weren't charged the difference. Only one or two pools were open daily and it was hard to find a chair. One day they closed the pool for a photo shoot and although everyone complained all the way up to the Pool Manager we were told we would just have to wait. We found the restaurants to be just okay and we found ourselves eating more at the Excalibur and Mandalay Bay, which were a short walk away. I will say the hotel, casino, restaurants, restrooms etc. were very clean and the hotel workers were friendly I am very sorry I did not take the advise of previous reviewers and not book the pyramid room	
Oct 10 2009 	great stay	just returned from a great stay at the luxor, was very wary as the reviews have generally not been good, all i can say is the other posters were certainly not staying at the same luxor that we were, very quick check in, a few mins only, upgraded to a tower room, no resort fee charged, no credit card needed at check in, very nice large room, clean, quiet, a little dated, but so what, polite staff, great house keeping, one of the bulbs in the room blew, was replaced in 10 mins, the hotel was very well updated inside, alive, buzzing, plenty of regular transport from this end of the strip, did'nt need to use the car, easy self parking, found a spot right buy the lifts, straight into hotel, buffet was good, mainstreet station buffet was much better and cost less, would recommend luxor and would stay again	
Oct 10 2009	What an amazing place	Went to Vegas in September for my husbands 50th. Stayed at the Luxor. Did'nt arrive at hotel till late at night, no queues at check in and given upgrade from a pyramid room to a tower room. Huge king size bed, air con, tv and partial view of the strip. Did open top bus tour which was $35 each for a ticket that lasted 48 hours. You get a map and it stops at about 12 major sites so hop on and off whenever you want. Had pics took at the 'Welcome to Vegas' sign and there's history and commentary on the bus and can get some good photos if sat upstairs. Cheaper option is to get the deuce bus instead for $9 a day. Be prepared for long time to get anywhere though as they get packed! Must visits are Treasure Island for the outside Pirate show at night, Lion Habitat at MGM, Fountains at Bellagio and trip up Eiffel Tower in Paris. Don't do the gondolier trip at Venetian. Only last bout 10 mins and not worth the $36. We booked helicopter flight over grand canyon which included sunset flight over the strip. Wow what an experience. When you first go out on the strip you just gaze in wonder how big the hotels are. Think we got lost in nearly every one we went in the're that big. It's like no place you've ever been but absolutely loved it.	
Oct 10 2009 	The hugeness was awesome but the amenities mostly cost too much extra.	WOW! I felt like I had walked into Egypt looking around the Luxor. It was very effective and accomplished exactly what the architects and designers set out to do: transport the visitor to a place long ago and far away, and make one feel like wandering around for days inside the hotel, just to see it all. I loved the views, the special touches in the decor, and the layout. I just didn't like having to pay $15 per day per laptop to use internet in the room, or paying $1 a minute to use their computers at the business center. The fact that there was no coffeemaker in the room was a real drag. At the rates we paid, I would've thought there would be a mini-frig and a microwave, but no. The only appliance was an iron. And there was certainly no continental breakfast!!! Still... had a great time. Loved it.	
Oct 10 2009 	Great Hotel what an experience!	Having read many reviews about Luxor being run down etc, I was a little worried about staying. We stayed as part of our honeymoon and I have to say we didn't have any problems whatsoever! We had a room in the East Tower which over looked the pyramid. The room was spacious and clean and the hotel had everything we needed.Luxor is at the start of the strip (or the end?!) so it is quite a long walk to other hotels, but we still enjoyed exploring and used the monorail for getting over to the other end.I would deffinately recommend Luxor, and we wouldn't hesitate to stay again.	
Oct 9 2009 	great casino on premises	Large rooms, restaurants on premises, good food, a little too much smoke in the casino.	
Oct 9 2009 	Had a great experience	We stayed at the Spa suite at the Luxor for our wedding. The room was huge and the hot tub in room was great. Hotel staff was friendly and they had our room ready for us early which was a big plus. I cant say it was too hard to get around, we didnt have any problems. We're not really picky people and have since stayed at Bellagio and Wynn and had just as good a time at the Luxor. Its not 5 star but its great for the price.	
Oct 9 2009 	Luxor.....nice but worth it?	My friends and I went on a very brief trip to Vegas to get some excessive partying out of our system. We stayed at the Luxor. I will say that the Luxor is super nice on the outside. I was always a big fan of ancient Egypt so the novelty of it was amazing. Our room was in the towers so I hear the ceilings are higher there. It was a nice room but sort of hard to find and while the room was pretty nice on the inside. There was a Mexican tape on mustache (the kind you buy at Party City for Cinco de Mayo parties) hanging on the artwork. Maybe the cleaning crew should have caught that. Other than that the room was clean, smelled good etc. We took several pictures standing in front of different statues etc and all in all its a nice hotel. The downside is that its sort of at the end of the strip. So it was a very long drunken walk from the other prettier and flashier casinos that we didnt want to miss. The money we probably saved per night at the Luxor we spent on cabs to take us back to the Luxor. To be totally honest we spent most of the night barhopping and casion hopping to really spend much time in the room. So if you're there to party - let's be honest thats what Vegas is for- then maybe you should get a hotel a few blocks down so you're right smack in the middle of the strip. If Chris Angel and pyramids is your thing then it will be worth it. If not.... I suggest the Bellagio or Ceasar's Palace.	
Oct 9 2009 	Hotel low average for location not outstanding	I was disappointed that we were not told that our room did not have a full bath (no tub). There were no warnings that the elevator would shift and wobble, causing us great concern. The LCD display panels in the lobby greatly distracted from the decor, so that the beauty and sense of being in an &quot;Egyptian atmosphere&quot; was diminished and spoiled on first sight. The sandwiches were overpriced. The buffet at $29.00 for the whole day had excellent food, at a reasonable price. The waiters and custodians throughout the hotel were friendly, except for the check-in clerk, who was professional, but not warm. The attractions were excellent, ie. Human Body, Titanic and the &quot;Menopause&quot; show. We did not see others due to lack of time. There are too many other hotels to again stay in a room without a bath tub, shaky elevators and ruined theme decor.	
Oct 9 2009 	Great location but the hotel is a bit old and run down	We received great and friendly service from check in to check out. The hotel is in a great location and most of the staff is pretty friendly.The hotel itself and the rooms look a bit run down and old. It could do with a repaint and redecoration - not exactly what one would expect at that price. Also I found that the prices on food and drinks where a bit outrageous compared to the surrounding hotels which are nicer. They could also do with more entertainment for guests in house.Still, overall a good stay and a lovely location right on the strip.	
Oct 9 2009 	Nice Hotel...Pyramid rooms need refit	Stayed at the luxor last week. Started off in a suite which we were told overlooked the strip. It didnt we were looking at mandalay bay. Was told we would be moved the next day but downgraded in the end as couldnt jusitfy the $50 extra a night for a suite.The pyramid rooms are very basic and serve the purpose for sleeping.. be prepared to see wallpaper taped to the wall...needs a complete refit. The tower rooms have all had a refit but why go to the luxor and not stop in the pyramid?? The amenities are great....tequila and tacos serve fabulous food. big meals and great margaritas. the MORE buffet is great value $30 for the whole day. worth everypenny. and a champagne brunch on saturday and sunday for $20..The hotel is at the end of the strip and is linked to excalibur and mandalay bay if you can ever find your way... very easy to get lost in this place.. Visited the bodies exhibition.. amazing... would highly recommend.dont forget to tip the drink ladies when gambling.. they come back :-)Overall a good place to stay..Not the quietest, with the clubs opening at 1am and the man screaming wooaaaa down a microphone..be prepared to do a lot of walking the strip and hotels are huge. The Duece bus runs up and down the strip I think it was $3 for 1 trip or $3.50 for a day pass. well worth it and very frequent during the day. dont bother at night due to the new complex being built the traffic comes to a standstill its quicker to walk.Went to the canyon west rim where the sky walk is.. TIP: Dont book your car at the hotel book it before you go. the hotel wanted $130 a day for a car. we booked our online with virgin atlantic for £44 with all insurances, extra driver, satnav and a tank of fuel.Also Dont book a Limo. We went to the stratosphere for a meal at the top of the world and booked a limo to take us. we had it booked for 1 hour. the driver took us the back way to the stratopshere going past the seedy vegas shops and we were there within 10 mins of getting in the limo. wast of money.. the hotel wouldnt do anythingeven though it was booked through them as it was a seperate company.I would reccommend the restaurant at the stratosphere though... (revolving restaurant). quite expensive..$250 for a 2 course meal and a bottle of wine.. but well worth it.(PS: If you want access to the internet you'll need a laptop and it cost $14.99 a DAY for access)Oh yeah and dont forget the price thats shown is not the price you pay.. tax is added at the till...strange...	
Oct 9 2009 	I thought I was in Egypt	Had a great time. The pool was fun. The food court was great since we had 10 year boys with us. Just wish it were more centrally located on the strip	
Oct 8 2009	Las Vegas	Stayed at the Luxor Was nice but probably better hotels. Stay away from Mickey Gilly's mud wrestling.	
Oct 8 2009 	The Luxor is over rated	The Luxor is listed as a 4 star hotel on many hotel booking sites. I think it is more in line with a 3 star hotel. The rooms are completely outdated. I &quot;upgraded&quot; to a tower room and it had popcorn ceilings and old thin mattresses. Cheap bedding. I would hate to see what the standard rooms look like. We were in the line to drop off our car with the valet but decided to get out of line because it was taking too long (over 15 mins). Bad idea. It's a really long trek from self parking all the way to the towers.	
Oct 8 2009 	good and affordable	This place was ok, the rooms were ok also. It was a pain to be clear at the end of the strip, I prefer to stay at TI where you are in the middle. The price was right.	
Oct 8 2009 	Short the bed	The Luxor served the purpose well - a place to sleep, but not much more. The mattress was hard and uncomfortable and the sheets were too short for the bed. Disappointing considering many hotel chains, from low-end to luxury, have very nice and comfy mattressess and bedding. But I would still recommend the hotel - good restaurants, excellent nightclub (LAX), nice pool, good customer service.	
Oct 8 2009 	Luxor Offers The Craps - tables that is...	My 1 night stay at the Luxor in Las Vegas was great. The property is clean, the pool environment nice, the restaurants varied and tasty...... and...Craps. I have always wanted to learn how to play, and there was a free 'Craps Lesson' available. I signed up for the Players Club to earn some bonus chips to play, and ended up winning on my first experience at the Craps table. What happened the NEXT night is a different story, but gambling is gambling!I'll be back to the pyramid next year.	
Oct 8 2009 	Good Value	We were very happy with the room, the only down fall is the bed were not that comfortable. The bathroom was a nice size. The hotel registration and check out went fast. The buffet at the hotel had very good food. The price of the hotel was good. It iwas nice that they had a monorail between three hotels.	
Oct 8 2009 	Had a great time even though I don't gamble.	The staff was friendly and helpful. The room was really nice with a beautiful view. There was plenty to do...we went to the Bodies Exhibition (they also had the Titanic Exhibition) and we also saw Cris Angel's Believe. The buffet was really good and there was plenty of room by all of the pools to relax. I will definitely book this hotel again.	
Oct 8 2009 	Average..Not great	My partner and I stayed at the Luxor as part of a 3 day trip to Las Vegas(our first time there) in early July 2009. We arrived at the hotel at 1130p and had to wait in line for 40 minutes to check in. We ended up getting a upgrade to a Tower Deluxe room because the Pyramid Deluxe room we booked were all filled up. Thank god for that because before we took off to Vegas I checked this website out to check out the reviews on this hotel and seen the 'horror' stories about the standard pyramid rooms and we were'nt looking forward to staying in these rooms....lol. The room we got had a good partial view of the strip looking northeast, but the room was outdated and the beds hard as a rock; but clean. The hotel is at the southern end of the strip, so it was a long walk going north on The Strip. The next time my partner and I go to Las Vegas(in Mid 2011), we'll be staying at a hotel that is more mid strip(The Mirage or TI) and has a room that is more up to date)	
Oct 8 2009	Vegas is always a blast!	I stayed at the Luxor and had a great time. Was able to make the Criss Angel Premiere Party and see all the great sites. I took advantage of the $30 all day long buffet at the Luxor. Great deal for all that food!	
Oct 8 2009 	Just Awful	The Luxor rooms are dark and mine smelled bad. The service at the hotel is bad. They are disorganized. The first floor is a maze that you can't find your way out of with a GPS system. The elevator was shaky. Need I say more?	
Oct 8 2009	Great Week	Great hotel, food was great and cheap!The hotel was clean and staff friendly.Would stay again!	
Oct 8 2009 	Don't Here If You Are Looking For Comfort	My husband and I stayed at the Luxor on our honeymoon when he returned from Iraq. We chose the Luxor because of the low price compared to the other Hotels, but wish now we would have spent the extra few dollars. The hotel location is on the end of the strip and it is a major hike to get to the other end. So next time we will try to choose a more centrally located hotel. The main reason that we will not be staying in the Luxor again is because of the lack of comfort. The bed in our room was like sleeping on the floor. The mattress was hard and the springs poked up in the back. I woke up with a soar back every morning. We called to see if we could get a room upgrade or just a different room, and they wanted to charge us extra a night. The helpfulness of the service at the Luxor was just not very good. This is an older hotel and even though there have been some recent renovations...I would definitely stay somewhere else.	
Oct 7 2009 	out dated needs full refit	Stayed at the Luxor for 5 nights With family and friends the hotel rooms need a whole refit the carpets had stains beds not to good ,staff rude , dont forget your id my 30 year old son and friend who were with use had to show id to drink coke and water in the bars. .Could do with more sun parosols at pool . But apart from the hotel which was not to my standed every one should go to fremont street such a good night for all the family.	
Oct 7 2009 	Luxor LasVegas	Started out with a jacuzzi room and lousy view from the window, ended up in the most fabulous, unbelievable Pent house suite on the top floor Great staff,friendly,and helpful. view the whole strip and the mountains from our room	
Oct 6 2009 	Cheap Deal -- you get what you pay for.	What a disappointment. We chose the Luxor on a &quot;deal&quot; and got just that -- a cheap room. Water stains on the ceiling, damaged furniture, a dirty washcloth on the bathroom floor and a bed that was too hard for sleep. A mattress topper from housekeeping helped the bed but we still wouldn't stay there again.	
Oct 6 2009 	A Little Disappointed	Arrived at hotel-suite not ready and i had booked room 2 months in advanced! Put us in the Pyramid-OLD rooms needing work! NOT worth the price i had paid for a Tower suite! Desk told us to check back at noon next day-same thing-room not ready.I became irate at which point i was asked if a 1st floor suite in the Towers would be suitable.Of course i agreed at this point seeing as to how i came to VACATION not bicker.Suite was advertised as coming with bathrobes &amp; bath slippers.No bathrobe,no slippers.After ANOTHER day,got bathrobes,told out of slippers.After ALL of this,i told desk attendant that this was EXACTLY the same problems i had read on the hotel reviews.Apparently nothing has changed..I at the very least was hoping to be compensated in some small way.Guess Las Vegas has changed and not for the better.	
Oct 6 2009 	Don´t believe the photos of the advertising	I chosed Luxor Hotel because me and my boyfriend really liked different style of the Hotel and the photos of the bedroom as they advertised were wonderful. I payed the average of 110 dolares a night in Sept 09 (they charge more 10.90 a day when you get there) and it really was disappointing. Although I requested a non smoking room, they gave us a smoking room and the smell was so strong that we had headaches and was really hard to sleep at night, but they said that didn´t have any other rooms available at the moment, that it would be possible only in the next day. Besides that, the room overall is so old, the furniture, the decoration, the bathroom..Nothing like the modern, clean and atractive room as the show when you buy in the Internet...There are lots of options if you want to eat there, but if you go to Mandalay Bay, they offer a variety of good and nice restaurants.But if you are interested in the nightclubs of Luxor, I think it´s worth staying there, because you don´t need to get in the same line that everybody else and it´s for free.	
Oct 3 2009 	Dont believe the bad stuff...	My wife and I had the pleasure of staying at the Luxor. We had the best time of our lives. They upgraded us to a tower room for free. The rooms are wonderful and clean. It is nice and quiet at night and only a short walk to the &quot;real party zone&quot;. Tacos + Tequila is a good place to eat. You need to see Blue Man Group, KA by cirque de soleil, and bodies the exibit if you go. Great job Luxor were coming back for sure	
Oct 3 2009 	dont listen to the bad reviews	arrived at luxor 13th september around dinnertime, waited for 10 to 15 mins tops, was worried abouth recent reviews, however we stayed here for 14 nights and didnt see any queues as far back as the casino.the rooms were fine we were in 9140 no probs with room, it was clean and two large beds, did get offered an upgrade to suites on 15th floor however 20 dollars a night so declined, I believe these have a fridge in them. we stayed in the pyramid itself, the towers are newer however after frorking out the money we paid for two weeks didnt want any additional cost to upgrade.there are plenty of fast food outlets ie macdonalds and nathans the pyramid cafe done nice steaks, not cheap for cooked breakfast. the pool is large but bar is very expensive 4 dollars for small water, 10 dollars for 16 oz cocktail and 7 dollars for bottle of beer, in the two weeks we were there only 2 of the 3 pools were opened, plenty of beds and you can find some shade if you go down early, if you take a small cool bag with you use the ice machines on any of the landings and buy your drinks from the vending machines as they are only 2 dollars a lot cheaper than the shops, you get an ice bucke tin you room as well If you want to got over to the strip instead of walking to the exclibur go on the free tram directly outside the main entrance and cross the road where the cars are parked, or get the deuce bus which stops outside the hotel accross the road it is 3 dollars one way , or 7 dollars for 24 hours you can also get one for 3 days for 15 dollars and you can get on and off as much as you like it can take a while to get from one end of the strip to the other depending on the traffic.If you like chinese then on the strip the same side as the mgm just before the m&amp;m shop go upstairs to the food court and you will see panda express you can get either fried rice or chow mein and then choose two main meals for 6.99 dollars its nothing fancy but nice food.places to visit, mgm grand to see the lion enclosure, feemont st , mirage volcano treasure island pirate show , ballagio fountains all free, for the paid events sharks reef was 17 dollars entrance fee its not huge but worth goin to see, secret garden in the mirage to see dolhins and lions and tigers was 15 dollars, went to see the lion king and jersey boys however is cheaper to book from uk than in resort also all the above take photos , the mandalay bay chrgd 44 dollars but all the rest only between 10 and 20 we only booked the cheap seats but views were still good, also went to see the fab 4 in v theatre planet hollywood they only do 5.30 in evening dont book at there box office go to tix4tonite, and you will get discounted tickets they are all over the strip, went to see grand canyon by heicopter and got picked up by limousine, again after getting there found it can work out cheaper booking before you go and dont book with your rep as it is more expensive.If you dont like gambling but want cheap drinks got to the casino royale opposite treasure island 1 dollar for margarita cocktails and bottles of beer, also slots for fun next to circus circus, and the duece bus stops right outside its nothing fancy but if you fancy a cheap night try here. also freemont street does margaritas for 99 cence I found the restaurants are very expensive its cheaper to eat in the fast food outlets, a must see is definitley the grand canyon, as an example dont pay anymore than 180 pounds if you are only going to fly over and back, we went with sundance but they didnt fly deeep enough into the canyon, I beleive heli usa go much deeper in .obviously the luxor is not the best hotel on the strip if you want top class then youll need to go to the ballagio or venetian, pallazzo or even the hilton or wynn and encore, then you are talking money, but at the end of the day it is only a bed, I have found the top hotels are very expensiv if you are staying in to eat and drink, we went to watch the jersey boys at the pallazzo and for 2 cokes and a water is was 11 dollars.We used the casino in the luxor and often played on the rapid roulette, we befriended ernest who was very chatty with us always made time for us, some of the stafff are very straightlaced and from thursday to sunday the place is full of youg americans , and they can be quite noisy, but after that it is quite relaxing, all your drinks are free regardless of what you are playing including the 1 cent machines but at the weekends the people on the tables will get served quicker, we used to tip 2 dollars a dollar a drink , that was for bottle of bud and cocktails ie margarita, pina colada or strawberry daquari, but you had a choice of any drink you likedto anyone who has already booked this hotel dont let anybody put you off, do watch out for the timeshare touts who look like hotel staff when you walk through the main entrance , they will ask you if you are interested in free shows, remeber nothing is free but you will have a ball as las vegas is a truly amazing place. left las vegas on the 27 september and was sad to go home	
Oct 3 2009 	Overcrowded hotel areas but Comfortable Rooms	Check in and check out was a bit of a nightmare with massive queues. The pool areas had insufficient shade / parasols and loungers. On a positive note the room was large and comfortable. The staff were friendly and helpful.	
Oct 3 2009 	never again	We have stayed at the luxor before and after the last stay we vowed never again. However the offer of 4 nights comped won us over in the end so for a week we arranged 4 nights here and 3 nights at Caesars.I wish we hadnt bothered and would never pay to stay here ... there's so so many better options for the price. The issues are :The rooms are now very datedLocation is not greatconstant harasement from Time share peopleUnfriendly service$3 min bet for a comped beer at the bar (could get the same for .75=$1.25 elsewhere)$13 a day resort feeDo yourself a favour and choose Paris, Planet Hollywood Flamingo or Treasure Island ... all similar priced but better.	
Oct 2 2009 	Average hotel not the best value for the price	We stayed in the first night of our honeymoon. The hotel is definitely attractive if you are looking for something different in LV. However, we were assigned a room (1701) which was extremely noisy (ice machine wall-to-wall). We would not recommend rooms at the beginning or the end of the corridor if you want quiet. The second room (1307) was better. Compared t the next experience in a much cheaper hotel in the Strip (Circus Circus) we found Luxor to be a bit overpriced. Also, there was a bit of mold i the door to the bathroom. Other than that, everything was clean and nice.	
Oct 2 2009 	What a Deal!	My fiance and I booked a Pyramid Spa Suite and were satisfied with the room. The room was quite large and included the jacuzzi tub, 2 AC units, and a small refridgerator in the sitting room area. It was clean, but it did show some signs of normal wear and tear (ie carpet worn, nicks on furniture etc) I've stayed at a few hotels in Las Vegas, and I would say the Luxor room was about the same as a room in New York New York. If you are paying $59 a night and expecting the Bellagio, well what can I say, you need to come back to reality. Cons we experienced, the king sized mattress was pretty hard and the bedding was very mediocre however I slept just fine. Also the check-in line was ridiculously long.I would highly recommend trying the Burger Bar restaurant in the walkway to Mandalay Bay, it was so delicious!	
Oct 2 2009 	Standard Vegas hotel with all the bells and whistles	Booked a 1 night stay in a spa suite. Our 15:00 Check-in was a nightmare with a line that stretched on to the casion floor. After the 1,5h checking line we had a very good time at this hotel the room was spacious and the jacuzzi was great.	
Oct 1 2009 	Great novelty hotel at a great price!	We checked in with no issues at 13.00. Reception was friendly and quick. We were warned about staying in one of the &quot;low ceiling pyramid rooms&quot; but actually that's what we wanted - the novelty factor of being in the pyramid. The room was very large and only the window wall is sloped so there are no issues. We were facing Mandalay Bay and the airport - no issues from noise.We stayed here for two nights - the rooms are great and the casino / restaurants / bars are good.	
Oct 1 2009 	does what it says on the tin	we stayed in the luxor hotel in june 2009 with our two teenage children. although the hotel is at the very end of the strip it was ideal as it was lovely and quiet at night time. (further down the strip is very busy and noisy.) we were apprehensive about staying here as some of the reviews were so bad, but they could not have been further from the truth. Although the hotel is a little dated and needs some refurbishment it was very clean. we had two interconnecting double rooms with two queen sized beds in each room. it was a huge amount of space for us and gave everyone the bit of privacy they wanted. The staff were very nice and helpfull, from the receptionist on check-in to the security gaurd in the casino (who gave us a tour of the hotel). The pool was ok but it was very hard to get beds at it unless you were there first thing in the morning. all in all we had a lovely stay in the luxor and would not hesitate to go back and Vegas is the most amazing place to see! Even with two teenagers (who cant wait to go back either).	
Oct 1 2009 	Pleasantly surprised	After reading some of the reviews I was a bit dubious about staying here. Needn't have worried though, yes parts of the hotel are in need of updating (we noticed they are actually doing some work in various places around the hotel), but overall we loved it. Our room was lovely and clean, we were a bit worried about noise in our room (on 19th floor) as the area outside the rooms looks out directly over the centre of the pyramid and down to the ground floor, but once inside the room you cannot hear a sound. Also it was close to the airport, but again not a sound from outside. Beds were very comfortable and had a lovely big walk in shower. Only downside (just a small one!) there is no tea or coffee making facilities - quite unusual in a 3/4 star hotel. If we had been there for longer than 3 nights we would have bought a kettle from Walgreens as advised by our rep as the coffee in the Hotel was expensive. Would probably stay somewhere else if we went to Vegas again but only because we'd like to sample other hotels on the strip, they all seemed amazing!! Overall we enjoyed our stay at the Luxor.	
Sep 30 2009 	deluxe pyramid rooms below par	if you go it would be worth your while to upgrade to the tower rooms. the pyramid rooms are in need of a facelift ,they are starting to show their age.Casino was very good and restaurants good especially liked T$T (mexican food)	
Sep 30 2009 	The Luxor Las Vegas	I have recently returned from Las Vegas - staying at the Luxor! The hotel itself was ok. We had requested a room in a pyramid suite however on arrival we were given a tower suite in the west tower (i think the check-in woman thought she was doin us a huge favour by giving us this - she said its quieter there ideal for couples .......it certainly wasn't). There was a long walk to our room which after a period of time started to become annoying! The suite (if you could call it a suite) was fine, clean enough and spacious! No coffee/tea maker though (as you are required to make purchases from one of the many starbucks down in the lobby), also the walls in the suites are paper thin. We heard every loud toilet flush/showers running/hairdryers/conversations and arguments the other residents were having (not pleasant at 4.00am) Overall all the hotel was ok. However be prepared to pay for a taxi on more than one occassion, if you fancy shopping go to the premium outlets (fab place) or even just getting to the other end of the strip is costly as the Luxor is pretty much at the south end of the strip. In 7 days we spent almost $400 on taxi's as the road on strip had been cut down to one side of traffic due to the amount of construction work which is undergoing on the new city centre developement. The buffet in the hotel is pricey for what you get, but good, however at the weekends go early or be prepared to stand in line for a long while. I probably would suggest the hotel to a friend but i wouldn't stay there again as it was too far out for me, i'll be staying central next time!!	
Sep 30 2009 	nice hotel	The hotel was very clean, all the staff were very helpful. we got upgraded to a tower room instead of a pyramid room that we paid for- i think this was jst as we had arrived at the tower check in without realising. i think the tower rooms are nicer that the pyramid- as they are more expensive. they add a $10.90 charge per room per night with is for resort fee, newspaper and bottled water. - this was never mentioned at the time of booking and even though the website said it included all charges and fee's we still had to pay. as we were there for 6 nights it was $65.76+ tax basically for bottles of water! apart from that the room was clean and tidy and the maid came on most days. we had a view of the main strip but as the hotel was right at the bottom end there was nothing opposite to look at except the airport! the hotel was abit out the way for me, i would have preferd to stay at new york new york, or planet hollywood. in the centre of the stip. apart from that the hotel was very nice, pool area was really impressive, i would stay here again, jst a shame its not in the middle of the strip!	
Sep 30 2009 	Luxor has gone downhill	We stayed at the Luxor hotel from 9/14-9/17. We booked a standard pyramid room. Upon check-in we upgraded to a Jacuzzi suite. The room size was great, however it was not well maintained. The bathroom tiles were falling off the walls. The wall paper was pealing off in the bathroom and also near the jacuzzi. You could hear the other rooms plumbing when they ran the jacuzzi or flushed the toilet. We stayed at the Luxor eight years ago and it has gone downhill. Also be prepared for a $10/night resort fee, which gives you a newspaper and two 8oz bottles of water. The casino was ok, it seemed to be very smokey compared to other casinos. They didn't have very many tables open. No in room safe or free wi-fi. We saw Carrot Top and he was very entertaining. Overall would not recommend.	
Sep 29 2009 	Not bad for the price	We recently stayed at the Luxor for a girls' weekend. I did not have high expectations for this hotel as it was not my choice. The hotel was better than I expected. The rooms (in the pyramid) were large and clean. The elevators made a few in our group a little seasick. Hhaving to walk all the way to one particular corner of the hotel to be able to access your room even if it is in opposite corner of the pyramid is a bit frustrating, but tolerable. We ate at T&amp;T for lunch. The food was good, but overpriced and they don't have any small items on the menu. The pools were okay, not too crowded which was nice and the food at the pool was somewhat reasonable in price, quality and choice. The gym is free to guests staying at the hotel and has a pretty good selection of equipment. It isn't the nicest place to stay in Vegas, but if you don't mind being on the south end of the strip and want to save a little, the Luxor is a good choice.	
Sep 29 2009 	Bit far down the Strip	After reading some of the less favourable reviews, we were slightly dubious about staying at the Luxor, but when we arrived we were pleasantly surprised. There was no queue for the check in and when we did so we were upgraded to a tower room even though we had booked a pyramid room. The rooms in the towers were clean, quiet and did not smell of smoke. The bed was huge as well. The location of the Luxor is not as good as hotels such as the Venetian and Caesar's, but it was well linked to Mandalay Bay (the Burger Bar in the Mandalay Place shopping centre was immense) and Excalibur, as well as not being too far from the Monorail. We rented out a cabana at the pool for one day which was a great relaxing day away from the madness of Vegas, the view from our room was beautiful, once you looked past the giant freeway all you could see was the desert. It was beautiful to watch the sun set (and rise- jet lag!) For first time travellers to Vegas, the Luxor towers were great and gave us the perfect chance to do all the exploring we needed. If we went back we might consider the Luxor but might want to stay somewhere a bit more centrally located, such as MGM Grand due to the heat! Overall we really enjoyed our stay and especially the cocktails at the Aurora bar.	
Sep 28 2009 	NOT what we expected	My husband and I went to Las Vegas for our honeymoon and booked the Luxor online. The pictures of the rooms looked nice, but were so deceiving. We got there in the evening and had to wait over 30 minutes to check-in. The line was so long and they only had a few people working. We then got on the squeaky and old elevator up to our room. Our room was as far from the elevator as you could get and once we got inside, we were SO disappointed. The rooms are so outdated and looked nothing like they did online. I don't think they've done any renovating to the rooms- just the lobby. Our sheets were stained and ripped and all the linens wreaked of cigarette smoke, even though it was a non-smoking room. Not the kind of bed you want for a romantic week. The TV was small and old and our remote died halfway through our stay. The bathroom was the nicest part of the room. Next time we're definitely going to stay somewhere else and at a hotel closer to the center of things. The only view we had was of the airport. Overall, this was not a good experience.	
Sep 28 2009 	Pleasantly Surprised	I recently (Sept. '09) stayed at the Luxor Hotel and had a wonderful time. I travel to Vegas every year in September (to celebrate my birthday with family) and must say this was one of the most enjoyable trips I have ever had. I had read reviews on the Luxor (after my tickets were already booked) and found some of the reviews to be anything but complimentary. Therefore, I was already starting to dread my stay at the Luxor. After arriving at the Luxor I was pleasantly surprised! We had to switch rooms to the East Tower (because our first room only had a walk-in shower ~ my mom insists on a bath tub) and the woman at the front desk was very nice and helpful. Our new room was on the first floor so we didn't have to mess with elevators and was clean and comfortable. We had a good view and no casino noise so it was very quiet. There was NO smoke smell unless someone sat down by me when I was gambling and they were smoking. We spent a lot of time at the Luxor and then discovered the escalators to Mandalay Bay. There was so much to do (shopping, eating, gambling, shows etc.) that we were busy all the time.If you want a clean, comfortable room at a good price then the Luxor is for you. I have stayed at many of the hotels on the strip (Excalibur, Monte Carlo, Sahara, Tropicana and New York New York) and will say the Luxor is by far my favorite hotel! I would recommend the Luxor to everyone and will stay there again next year. :)	
Sep 28 2009 	Good hotel - bit far down strip!	The Luxor is a really noce hotel, but it a bit far down the South end of the strip. Rther difficult to get out of the hotel and negotiate the walkways and overpass. We found by going through the Excalibur and over to the New York easier. The rooms are very clean. Maid service is daily. The lifts are awful. They are called inclinators and move and rock a bit as you are in the Pyramid. If you stay here check out the Titanic Exhibit - it's great! The all day buffet at $30 is also really good value.	
Sep 28 2009 	Very Disappointed	We stayed at the Luxor for 4 nights, the second leg of a 3 centre holiday (LA, Vegas and San Francisco - Virgin). We were very expectant of a wonderful and exciting stay at the Luxor; we were very dissapointed. We arrived in Vegas after a 4 hour drive from LA (Anaheim) on Labor Day (Public Holiday) - nightmare traffic! Parking is the first hurdle. Valet parking is available (tips, tips, tips) or self park is available at the rear of the pyramid, in a purpose built free multi-story. Tip: unload the car at the front first as it is quite a hike from the multi-story through the casino floor back to reception - as I found out! Check-in took an absolute age (40 minutes) as the queues were horrendous. We were offered an upgrade to the tower for $20pp per day when we finally got to the desk. I declined as we had booked Superior with Virgin and I was expecting the same standard of accomodation that we had enjoyed at the Sheraton Anaheim - wrong!! Our room was 17143 on the seventeenth floor. Getting there is a trek as only certain lifts serve certain floors, as they go up at an angle in each corner - pyramid and all that. Our lift (3b), an interesting ride, was the furtherest from reception. On entering the room we were immediatly dissapointed by the shabby, tatty, tired and dated appearance of the decor, which would not have looked out of place in some tacky US 70/80's TV soap. Poor/inadequte lighting compounded the feel of oppresion. I likened the lighting throughout the Luxor to the London Tube; for those UK readers and others who have experienced the tube - you will know what I mean.Our view was not unpleasant, the strip with the airport in the background, and would have been even better had the windows been clean externally and more so internally. The room had a very musty smell and had obviously had smokers (it was a non smoking), which was confirmed by the discovery of an old half full ashtray hidden on top of the wardrobe after we had unpacked; so much for room cleaning! The carpet was an undesirable grey (although it may have been beige once) and during our stay wasn't hoovered once; confirmed by the plastice clothes label tag that remained in the same postion for the duration of our stay. No coffee making facilities and no fridge was explained to me by reception as a precautionary measure against fire as the hotel was so large. I interperated this as a way of making money as the two inhouse Starbucks fare quite well judging by the massive queues in the morning, whilst the little in-house shops charge $2.00+tax for a 500ml bottle of milk or orange juice! The hotel is at the top end of the strip and sits between the Excalibur and the Mandalay, All three are joined by a free monorail service. It is quite a walk to the centre of the strip, whilst the Stratosphere is at the other (original) end of the strip and a good 3-4 mile trek. Tip: If you have a car, use the free multi-story car parks at the rear of each hotel. Strategic parking has endless benefits and air-con (it is hot, hot, hot), just remember where you parked it. The hotels are on a massive scale and you can easily become disorientated. The Luxor is massive and does hold within the pyramid, aside from poor standard rooms, a considerable array of other attractions to be sought out. We did an in-house show 'Menopause - The Musical' and laughed all the way through - very funny. Cris Angel was sold out the nights we were there. Tip: Book shows in advance for good tickets. As non smokers my wife and I found the liberal smoking permitted on all casino floors to be unpleasant, so for protracted stays on the casino floor for non smokers, expect to come out smelling like an old ashtray! You either love it or hate it; with Vegas there is no in between. I favoured the later and by day two had had enough and wanted to leave. We did the Grand Canyon with Grand Canyon Tours Voyager 5-1, pre-booked in UK. Flew out to the west rim, did Skywalk and helicopter down to the Colorado River, boat trip along before helicopter up and flight back to Vegas. The peace and tranquility whilst floating down the Colorado River was a welcome break from Vegas. The Grand Canyon IS a must and is awesome in its scale. Tip: research and book Grand Canyon trips ideally in advance as in Vegas there are so many tour operaters offering deals that are not what they seem. I spoke to a disgruntled American from Seattle on the Skywalk who had travelled 4 hours on a ramshackle double decker bus, only to be rushed around before the return trip in the same bus, a total of 11-12 hours. He paid more than me as he had purchased from the strip. I hadn't the heart to tell him what I paid as it was far less. Would I recommend the Luxor - no. However, if you are not that fussy and just use the room to 'crash' then it is OK I suppose. Get the tower rooms, they are far better. We are glad we have been to Vegas and seen the sights. Every hotel/casino is worth a visit as they all have sometyhing special. My favourites were the Bellagio, Ceasars Palace and the Venetian - but not the Luxor. Would we go back. No!	
Sep 27 2009 	Brilliant Hotel Amazing Vegas	Stayed at the Luxor for 2 weeks, rooms very big, 2 double beds, and a sitting area. In need of slight updating but clean and comfortable. As it is vegas you can go out into the hotel at anytime night or day and feel safe wandering around. MORE the buffet ws really good and looke dlike a restraunt, my hisband preffered the Excalibur buffet next door but restraunt was more like a dining hall, If loking to book a grand canyon trip go to the Game works along from MGM, they will book a vip trip which picks you up at a choise of 5 hotels and takes you to the Boulder Dam Hotel at Boulder City (supposed to be haunted) for breakfast then hoover dam, the joshua tree forrest, drops you at the skywalk where you can wander and see real Indians, before getting on the bus to take you to next part of canyon, then the next bus takes you to a ranch where you have lunch before heading back to hoover dam to take your pictures. all for $144.00 per person. great value. The only thins is it is tips, tips tips all the way. drinks can be expensive in hotels but if you play the slots you can order a drink from waitress and all you have to pay is $1.00 tip per drink whiether is is a soft drink a beer or spirits and cocktails.	
Sep 27 2009 	Loved It!	Stayed in the Luxor for 5 nights in mid Sept 09 as the first part of a 2 stage Honeymoon.Loved this hotel  just make sure youre in the pyramid as by being in one of the towers I think youd lose a bit of the magic.The only downsides were:1) The Luxor is at one end of the strip (its about 4 miles to the Stratosphere at the other end). There is only one hotel (Mandalay Bay) in the other direction. However, the bus along the strip is pretty straightforward and decent value.2) The casino was good, but there are better ones in other hotels3) There are better restaurants and entertainment in other hotels4) Our hot tub didnt workHowever, that said, we just used the hotel as a base and visited every other hotel on the strip anyway, so it was fine as a base.Its also internally connected to the Mandalay Bay and Excalibur, so you can eat/gamble/entertain yourselves in those without even going outside.Thought the Egyptian theme and atmosphere was really good, as was the price we paid.Thought the room (PYRAMID SPA SUITE) was excellent other than the hot tub not working.If youre going to stay anywhere on the strip, if you get a good deal, this is the one for you.	
Sep 26 2009 	JUST GOT BACK HAD A GREAT TIME WEST TOWER ROOM WAS LOVELY	we just got back from five day trip to vegas with our 10month old son, and stayed at luxor it was absolutely fine we stayed in west tower, lovely room air con ice cold if you want it, and quiet, fresh towels, pleasant staff, we checked in straight away this was at around 1130pm though. pyramid cafe was lovely food as was the buffet, close to mandalay place with loads of shops and shark reef, and next to excalibur which was nice, walk to mgm was across 2 bridges to nearest monorail which was no trouble. we were a bit weary taking our little one but he had a smile on his face the whole time and slept like a log! expect to do a fair bit of walking but you can do most inside if need be. The pool was lovely rather shallow thou3-4ft, overall top hotel	
Sep 26 2009 	Hot in the Pyramid	On arrival the Luxor by sheer size is most impressive, however our room was uncomfortably warm despite the airconditioning - more than likely caused by the hot sun on the glass of the pyramid. There is a worn and old feeling on the walls and carpets leading to the rooms. There is no room safe and no small fridge - which was desperately needed given temperature of the room.	
Sep 26 2009 	You get what you pay for 100% luxury	You can find good deals even on the hotel's official website, out of high season 150 USD are possible; I would defenitely rate this a 5 Star hotel, therefore a great value.We had a room that was not in the pyramide but in the recommendable tower that is located next to the pyramide. Great amazing view on the surrounding hotels, great beds, internet is not free, but that was to be expected.There seem to be some new deals in town that I also want to try, but if you wanna do it Vegas style for a reasonable price, this is where to go.	
Sep 25 2009 	Wow factor... good hotel for the money!!	After reading many reviews I was very nervous about the Luxor, however I found many of the negative comments to be unfounded. I am not sure what people expect at this hotel - if your after 5 star then stay at Bellagio or Ventian!!!We stayed at the Luxor for 3 nights and booked an online special for 2 queen beds (Pyramid Deluxe Room). The room cost us $195 USD for the stay. The room was very clean (most important for us!) and reasonably comfortable.The check in and check out were reasonable (a short wait of no more than 10 min) and the staff were extremely helpful and friendly.The location is just ok (at the northern end of the strip), however I would recommend splitting your stay in 2 hotels if you are in Vegas for more than 4 nights as it is a very long way to the other end of the strip! We were in Vegas for 5 days in total and spent 2 days in luxury at the Venetian!!!The pool was great with the pyramid providing a fantastic back drop. The pool, however was only waist deep but was perfect for me andf my kids to stay cool!!!!!Overall, the Luxor provides a unique experience in Vegas. It is clean and reasonable comfortable for the price you pay!!!!	
Sep 25 2009 	Not Impressed	I stayed in Vegas for four days earlier this month and I must say, I will not be rushing to go back. Although the hotels really are 'something else' I really did not like how loud, expensive and busy the hotel was - it did not feel like a vacation. I agree with the previous reviewer, who stated that there are a lot of 'depressed gambelers' - SO true!Good points of the hotel included the room size and decor - totally fine, nice bathroom other than the fact that our first day had NO hot water, receptionist was not apologetic at all. We got woken up during every night of our stay (on 4th floor) - I suggest you request a room that is not in the pyramid, the blocks may be quieter.Receptionist at check in was really not helpful at all. We were not made aware of where anything was and because the hotel was SO big it was so easy to get lost.Pool area isn't very good - pool is only 3 ft deep all the way around so you can't exactly swim. I found that the pool area was completely packed full of posers too.Entertainment in this hotel seems to be the worst on the strip - I advise anyone who goes to Vegas to go to the Palazzo to see the Jersey Boys. I hear the Mandalay Bay next door has a good production of the Lion King on too. Food in hotel is ridiculously overpriced - especially room service.There is a lot of facilities in the hotel although they are really expensive - for example internet in the business centre and the spas cost a fortune.Overall I would not recommend this hotel - if 'big' hotels don't bother you I would go for the Venetian, Bellagio or Caesars Palace. I personally would not recommend Vegas either - if you're wanting to go on your first US city break New York or San Francisco are MUCH better!	
Sep 25 2009 	Very Nice and a Great Deal	We really liked it here and felt it was a great value for the money. Asked for and received a no-smoking room on the 14th floor - very quiet and no smell of smoke at all. Carpet a bit dingy and worn but room was clean. We enjoyed the Egyptian theme. Check-in line was very very long so we went to the West Tower check-in and had no wait at all. That probably saved us an hour or more. We enjoyed the buffet and used the all-day dining for $29 promotion twice. Didn't go to pool but it looked very nice.	
Sep 24 2009 	Luxor Suxor	I just attended a conference in Las Vegas and stayed at the Luxor to save the company a little money. I arrived on a Sunday. The room several doors down from me had a used room service tray outside their door with half-eaten soup, a ketchup-laden plate and some beverage glasses. The tray remained outside the door for TWO DAYS. In addition, I stayed in a room with two queen beds. One of the beds had old, rancid gum stuck to the comforter. When I went to check out with the convenient express check-out, the keyboard supplied to enter an email address didn't work, so I had to wait in a line of roughly 30 people. The smoke stench permeates throughout the rooms. I will never step foot in Luxor again!	
Sep 24 2009 	great time in vegas baby!!!!	stoped in the luxor for 5nights and had an amazing time!!we had a room on the 7th floor in the prymid, we loved it. people say it needs to be re-decorated but if this was to happen it would take away the OLD egyptian theme! the rooms are a bit dark but the light in the bathroom means you can get ready in &quot;normal light&quot; so there is no problem. made service every day with clean towls etc... some have said check in was a long wait, but we were in our room within 10mins of gettin to hotel cant be bad. the hotel was amazing (been our 1st time) we were very pleased with our pick of hotel.there is a walk way to the Excaliba hotel and also you can walk into Madalaybay hotel. there is a food court in the hotel with plenty of other restarunts to eat at.The LAX night cub inside the Luxor is brill!!! and if you ar stopping at hotel you do not pay the $20 entrance fee.the only thing i will say is do NOT have the service charge, this is where you pay $10.95 per day to have 2x bottles of small water and a news paper every day. (paper is left outside your door every morning but just leave them there) and you will not be charged.the pool is beautiful! there are 3 pools, when it gets busy they open more up.this has got to be one of the best places i have ever been too!if you want a hotel that treats you like you are the Queen or a king then pay to stop at the Wynn or Bellagio. to me its simple but you can not please every one?!enjoy your time as im sure you will... Looking to book for next year now	
Sep 23 2009 	Waste of money for rather run down room a lot of seriously depressed gamblers	We took this hotel thinking it would be &quot;different&quot; and the only reason to be in LV was to see the Cirque du Soliel perform &quot;O&quot;. The staff were very friendly but the first room was in the pyramid on the third floor with no view out of the back except to look onto the back of a neon sign and faced the very noise reception and casino. On insisting to be moved we had to upgrade to the Tower and having asked for a no smoking room we were given a room that reeked of stale smoke. When we called reception we were informed that indeed it had been a smoking room and now was not! They did offer to spray it but being very tired we settled for our own remedy, a candle. They did offer to move us but the next night only. The rooms was large but drab and of course with over 3,000 rooms there are no tea/coffee facilities. The welcome evening was a bit like Butlins holiday camp in the UK. On the bright side the staff are friendly and the food was excellent and for those who like the &quot;all you can eat package&quot; this is good quality. I would not go back to this hotel.	
Sep 23 2009 	Sell Sell Sell	Check in wasn't the hassle that some suggested, so far-so good. The room was big, with a nice bathroom and though the decor wasn't what you'd call modern there was nothing to object to either. TV channels were poor by US standards though. Food options were good - we tried the Pyramid cafe, the buffet and Tender and while they're not the Venetian, this is a lower end hotel. What really marked the hotel down was four things:1. The guys who were presumably trying to get you to go to a timeshare presentation were everywhere, constantly hassling you. One day, on the trip to breakfast I had 7 offers, &quot;you wan voucher, you wan voucher&quot;. For god's sake, I'm staying a hotel, this shouldn't be happening...2. Getting a drink out of the casino is well nigh impossible - I wasn't spending a fortune or anything, but enough - I'd estimate that the drink rate was about 1/3 of the likes of the Tropicana.3. A couple of staff were simply obnoxious. I tried the poker school and the guy running it made it clear that we needed to be playing a decent sized money game after half an hour or we needed to ship out. All 10 people at the table - unsurprisingly - walked. One of the roulette guys was dismissive too. Vegas used to be a place where beginners could try out - and other casinos still do well by realising this - but the Luxor staff didn't have that mentality.4. In a five night stay I got 6 recorded messages on my phone asking me if I wanted to buy limited edition Luxor T Shirts or to extend my stay. Funnily enough, I didn'tSo, sleep/eat here if it's cheap, but spend your evenings elsewhere	
Sep 22 2009 	STAY AWAY!!!!	I booked a 2 night stay for our first wedding aniversary. We wanted to stay on the south end of the strip, since we had tickets for Lion King. I regret my decision to stay here.The first room we were in was on the 4th floor of the pyramid... overlooking a parking lot! The first thing my wife and I both noticed was a strong odor of smoke (we were in a non smoking room, and it was posted as such). Well, we opened a bed side drawer, and it had an ashtray and matches! I called the front desk.. I was PISSED. The manager tried to tell me that under fire code, they had to provide an ashtray, even in non smoking rooms. THIS IS COMPLETE BS. I work for a hotel in town, and non smoking rooms are just that.. non smoking. Nothing in the fire code dictates placement of ashtrays. She agreed to move our room, and we waited 30 minutes for a bell man to come up.. even after I asked them to expedite, since we had 530 dinner reservations.The new room was no better. Small hole in the wall next to the bedside lamp. Valances (both top and bottom) were water stained. The room SUCKED.We went to breakfast on Monday morning, to their coffee shop. Hostess never even acknowledged us.. a server finally came up and took us to our seats. THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR *HITTY SERVICE.Don't know how they manage to get repeat customers.	
Sep 22 2009 	Non-Smokers Beware!	My husband and I just returned from a 3 day trip to Vegas. We decided to stay at the Luxor because my sister-in-law was already staying there as part of a business trip.Walking into the lobby was like walking into a wall of smoke! There was no place to go in the hotel to escape the smell, Even our non-smoking room on the 9th floor of the east tower smelled smoky. We walked through and visited several other casinos on the strip - NYNY, Paris, MGM Grand, Mandalay Bay and Ceasars's. None of the other casino floors and eating places were as smoky.If it hadn't been for limited room availabilty at other places due to the fight in town that weekend we would have switched hotel after the first night.If the room had been really nice it might have made up for it but the rooms in the East Tower are looking tired and dated. The mattresses are not comfortable.The only good part to staying at the Luxor was deciding to try eating at T&amp;T's. The Carne Asada plate was awesome! I also reccommend the Guac.	
Sep 21 2009 	Overrated 	I tried not to let my 26 hour transit from the UK to colour my opinion, but off the 12 hotels &amp; inns I have used during this holiday, this was &quot;comfortably&quot; the worst. The room was particularly disappointing - tired, cheap, worn &amp; basic in amenities. To charge extra for internet connection was particularly mean.	
Sep 21 2009 	perfect for us	There is a lot of rubbish written in previous reviews for the Luxor.....Check in was quick and easy, we had to wait behind about 5 other parties but this took no more than five mins. Didn't see a line much longer than this all week.We were offered a choice of rooms and chose one on the ground floor for ease of access. This obviosly meant we had a view of a carpark - so what? all we did was sleep in there! You dont often want the curtains open anyway as the windows are so large and its so bright outside. The room was spotlessly clean and daily maid servive was excelent. Couple of small maintainance issues (like door knob missing off cupboard), I supose a bit of tarting up wouldn't hurt but you could never call it rundown and the themeing is great. Hot shower and clean fluffy towls - happy with that!We loved the casino at Luxor, it's smart with a great atmosphere but without being stupidly busy (like the MGM), so quite relaxed. Players club is a must - we are no high rollers but using our card still got us three good meals and two exhibitions free. Often a slow moving queue at the players club desk, but its open 24hrs so go when its quiet. Free drinks while you play but there seem to be a few spots where waitresses never turn up.The hotel is not the most central but with walkways between neighbouring hotels and about 10 mins walk to the monorail at the MGM (we found this the best way to get around, the bus is soooooo slow) you can be anywhere on the strip in about 20 mins. The building itself is amazing, just huge. Decent selection of bars and restaurants, but lack of good places to eat in the early hours (only the pyramid cafe is 24hrs). 'Bodies' is amazing and must be seen. Good pool, but too hot for us out there most of the time! Friendly staff everywhere. No free wi-fi or safe in rooms, which I think is a bit poor.Overall, the Luxor is not the Wynn, Bellagio etc, but it doesn't cost anything like those places either. Manage your expectations accordingly and you really won't be disapointed.	
Sep 20 2009 	GREAT VALUE AS ALWAYS!	My husband and I decided to back to Vegas after finding a cheap flight. We had been offered 2 nights free at New York, New York, Monte Carlo and Mandalay Bay, so called each one to find out how much our other 2 nights would be and it ranged from $55 to $140 each additional night. Called the Luxor, and was offered $45 off per night leaving a cost to us of $5.00 per night! plus free slot play, upgrade to tower room, $30 resort credit towards meals, etc. so we decided, we might as well stay there again for the time that you spend in your room. We love this end of the strip as we enjoy Mandalay Bay, New York New York, MGM, and if you want to go farther, walk, take the deuce bus or a cab! We always charge our meals to the room when eating at any of the MGM resorts which are connected with the Luxor's player's card so that we also get comped when checking out. Do this at the players club BEFORE you check out to see what they will offer you - usually a few free nights, cash off your meals, etc. The food at the Luxor is great as always - huge portions. The casino is easy to get around and we have always found the staff to be very friendly and helpful. The Luxor is connected to Mandalay Bay and Excalibur so it is nice and easy to get to the other casinos. Mandalay Bay has a very upbeat casino with alot of free bands playing in the House of Blues, bars, etc. so we really enjoy going there at night.Shopping at the Premium Outlets is great - a $17 to $20 cab ride there but be prepared to do some major walking. There are alot of different stores!	
Sep 20 2009 	King Tut's house was fun could use a bit of a facelift...	Check in was a breeze. The pyramid rooms were tough to manipulate at first, but you got the hang of it. Make sure you insist on a high up room. Ours was on the second floor, which was great to get in and out quickly, but we had a view of the side of the next building over...the wallpaper and bedding looked weathered. None the less, make sure you spring for the corner/spa suite. Only a minimal upgrade and the room is huge and the spa well needed after long days of sightseeing!!!! It's truly a two person size so it's intimate! Drink service at the casino was okay, make sure you pick a table/slot by the bar (make a lap and you'll see which ones that the servers use!) and you'll get much faster service!The Luxor is on the bottom of the strip, but located close to some great hotels/casino's. We didn't really go much past all the surrounding hotels, for we had all we needed there!	
Sep 20 2009 	Pyramid Dream	Well my wife and I along with 2 friends of ours have just returned our holidays to the USA and stayed at the Luxor. We stayed for 5 nights and had a nice time there. We had a wee flutter in the casino and won a small amount of money so it was fun.The hotel itself is not too large by Vegas standards but it is still awesome to look at both inside and out. The rooms in the pyramid are not what I had hoped for. They were quite dark and not very well lit and the décor was very much like you would expect in an Egyptian pyramid a grainy dark coloured wallpaper which made the room look old. The wardrobe was also not very new it had quite a few marks on it and has seen better days. But put it this way its a room to sleep in and nothing much else. The other facilities in the room were just what we needed a walk in shower, TV, hairdryer etc. All in all the room was good but not quite what we have stayed at other hotels in Vegas.The room service by the maids was good and was done every day as expected.The hotel has obviously the casino part and has a few bars in it which we went to several times. The bar service and waitresses were very helpful and always available to get a drink from. There are a few restaurants also but we just went to More restaurant for the buffet. Its a eat what you like whatever you like for a set price. The quality of the food was very good and variety was the same. You can get an all day ticket for the restaurant which enables you to visit the restaurant anytime you wish and eat whatever you like. At the weekends they have a champagne brunch which is exactly what it says you get a buffet lunch along with as much champagne as you like. The waiters/waitresses come along and top up your glass whenever you like. The food here was good and we would recommend it.The pools at the hotel were good, lifeguards were on hand at each of them and if you have plenty of cash to splash out you can hire a gazebo for $200 a day. The gazebo has a fridge a flat screen TV and a chest of drawers to store your clothes in it. You can have up to about 4 people inside keeping away from the hot rays of the sun. However if your like us, we just do what most folk do and lie out in the sun and go into the shade every now and again.All in all the hotel served its purpose as a base for visiting Vegas but there are better hotels for a similar price to stay at. We would recommend this hotel if you are wanting to see what it is like to travel in a lift that goes sideways rather than vertically and stay in this different shaped hotel.	
Sep 19 2009 	Great hotel!!!!!!!	My wife and I stayed at the Luxor for our 5th anniversary in Sept 09. Checkin was a breeze since they let us checkin beginning at about 10:30am. When we approaced the desk (about a 5 min wait) I gave the Hotel clerk a $20 dollar bill in between my license and Credit card and asked him if they had any comp upgrades available to help us celebrate our 5th anniversary. He could not find any in the computer so he told us to hold on and went and asked to manager on duty. When he returned he upgraded us from a basic room in the pyramid to a Spa Suite in the pyramid (which is the room we wanted to begin with). He was very friendly and helpful. He told us it was only on the third floor but that is all they had. He also told us that we had almost $100 in credits that we were not aware of when we booked, which was a nice surprise. We took it!!!! with his helpful directions we found the elevator and our room with no problems. The room was great. Big bed, big living room, big shower, 2 tvs and a spa tub right in front of the window. We had 2 big windows but did not have a great view since we were only on the 3rd floor but we didn't complain one bit. The casino was a very lively and fun place. We both got players cards when we got there to begin earning comps. The players card can be used in alot of the different casinos so if you go to other casinos you are still earning comps at the luxor. We toured the Titanic exhibit and it was great. If u go to the luxor u have to do this. a little pricey but find a coupon on the internet because it is worth it. Alot of people complain about the people trying to sell u timeshares. if u tell them no they will leave u alone and not harrass u. Great customer service and GREAT hotel.	
Sep 19 2009 	Loved the Luxor	After reading countless reviews we was afraid to stay at the Luxor but it was to late for us to change hotels so I went with an open mind and plenty of Lysol. Suprisingly, we had a wonderful stay. Upon arrival we arrived at 8:00 am checkin was not until 4 pm. But they offered to take our bags so that we could go on with our day and offered to check us in at 10:00 am. When we went back aorund 11 am to check in I admit lines were long but they moved fast. We checked in quickly and given keys. Without knowing they had uppgraded us from a pyramid room to a one bedroom suite in one of the new towers for free. We were shocked and excited we had only paid about 30 bucks a night and got all that for free. The room was beautiful with a fridge, wet bar and floor to ceiling windows. Great view of the Strip and the mountains. The beds were a little hard but hey we hardly got any sleep with all the excitement. With our package we also recieved free show tickets to see Cris Angel which I absolutely loved I don't see why people give it bad reviewsOverall we had an excellent stay, we didn't gamble much at Luxor mainly at Excalibur but we did see a number of people get lucky at slots that week. Would I stay again, Absolutely but next time I plan to stay at another casino, for a different experience. Hopefully were as lucky as we were at Luxor.	
Sep 19 2009 	Nice hotel	After reading some reviews i was a litle bit scared , but i had no problems at all at the luxor,room was clean,everything worked well,no strange smells,very nice pool,very nice location ,it was a good deal.	
Sep 18 2009 	Brilliant	I loved staying here. So spacious inside, the rooms are amazing, the staff are friendly. The casino is great. You are at one end of the strip but there are easy monorails connecting the main hotels. Really good value for money especially if you book early enough in advance. Look out for handy tour voucher books, you can get some great last minute deals on grand canyon tours and helicopter trips.you can cross into the king aurthur hotel through some travellators which has some lovely restaurants and shops and the pools are beautiful.	
Sep 18 2009 	Perfect!	Really good, cool hotel with great bars and casinos and clubs! Good restaurants and close to other hotel / casinos and shops!	
Sep 17 2009 	BRILIIANT HOTEL	cant believe all the rubbish being written about this hotel we found it excellent with great facilities no problems checking in we went to the east tower were taken right away buffet was brill all the other resrtaurants good value for money pool was very good with loads of beds staff very helpful and freindly some bpeople just love to moan get real for the money what did you expect the venetian or the ballagio	
Sep 17 2009 	Always a good place to stay	We come to Vegas 3-4 times a year and have stayed several places. Luxor is a nice place to stay if you book a tower room. We stayed in a pyramid room once to get the Spa Suite and while it was nice to have the jacuzzi tub, the pyramid rooms are pretty run down. We don't sweat the small stuff and always enjoy our stay. The casnio is spacious without being so big as MGM where you get lost. The walkways to both Mandalay and Excalibur are convenient and lead to great places to eat. I have read reviews about the time share people pressuring hotel guests but we nicely tell them we get free rooms and keep walking - they leave us alone. Its not a five star hotel but we get comped free rooms by using our players club card in the machines and there is nothing wrong with the rooms. Spacious and well furnished. T&amp;T is a fun place for a bite to eat. We have had many meals at the cafe and always enjoy. And the Food Court is great for a quick breakfast or a late night snack. We even got married here at the Chapel two years ago and it was beautiful and fun! Friendly staff. We are not pool people so I can't comment on that.	
Sep 16 2009 	Good Value for the Money	Definately clean during our stay in 2006! Lots to see in Vegas as alwys, shows are fun, do a couple day trips recommend seeing Hoover Dam, and take a charter plane to the Grand Canyon! Casino, pools are all good at the Luxor during our stay, go to the rain forest for lunch with the kids and the M&amp;M store if they're still around !	
Sep 16 2009 	Old Casino with smelly water.	We reviewed the Luxor online and found that for the price it seemed like a good place to stay. The only bad review we could find was long check-in lines. The line was long but moved very quickly, no problem there. I had reserved a non-smoking room far from the elevators to avoid extra noise during our stay. The room we got was right next to the elevator and while not a smoking room the furniture was stained and the sink had a smell like sulfur which seemed to be coming from the sink. We contacted the front desk and they said they would look into it, but due to plumbing and sewer issues this sometimes happens. Really? Try washing your face or brushing your teeth with water that smells and tastes terrible!The pool had music blaring on saturday afternoon and they ran out of towels. Also, the pool area closes at sunset.. what?? I guess they really want you to stay in the casinos as long as possible so give them money and inhale smoke. During our time on the strip we went to the Mandalay bay and Caesar's palace. They showed us what a really nice casino was! I guess the Luxor is ok for the price and location, but I will not be staying here again.Oh, if you do go be sure to get specific directions if this is your first time here. We had difficulty navigating the casino and locating our room due to the vague directions given at check in.	
Sep 16 2009 	Top Notch	My daugther and now son-in-law decided to get married in Las Vegas. It was fairly late notice (6 weeks) and they decided on staying at the Luxor. I (her Dad) and her Mom and the groom's Dad all booked rooms at the Luxor. We were all on different flights from different locations across the country, and we all arrived at the Luxor at different times. After reading the reviews about check in and check out here, I cringed. I braced myself, but check in (and out) was a breeze. I couldn't believe it. It was actually easier than at most hotels. Everyone else in our party said the same. Maybe it was the days and time I used this service (9:00pm Tuesday and 10:00am Thursday) but the lines were short and moved quickly with friendly knowledgeable people on the other end. There is an express check out which you can do in your room if you leave a card on file at check in. Maybe I just got lucky, but the whole time I was there, I never witnessed a problem as I looked at the check in area every time I passed it.Upon arrival the room I requested was not available and they offered me an upgrade immediately without having to ask.I very much like an air conditioned, cooler than average room, and saw where many on here said their a/c's were not functioning. I stayed in the tower...the newer section and mine worked great. The room was basic, but big enough and clean and cool. Pleasantly surprised...and for $50/night you can't beat it.The location is great. First stop to be dropped off by airport shuttles and last to be picked up. Definitely use the shuttles right outside of baggage pick up. Roundtrip is only $11.50. Cabs are a gamble with one costing one of our party $32 while some got the same ride from the airport for only $14 one way.After going up and down the strip and looking at other hotels, there are some nicer and some not as nice, but the value for me was very good. I'd stay there again and recommend it to anyone. Again, maybe I got lucky and got there at the right times, but I never saw any long lines...at least ones that didn't move extremely fast.Thanks Luxor!	
Sep 16 2009 	Good Hotel For a Short Stay	My wife and I stayed in the Luxor on the first leg of our honeymoon in August 2009. The hotel is very close to the airport and getting a cab there was straight forward and not too costly. The Luxor is huge and is more like a resort than a hotel with a high number of shops, eateries and of course a large casino. We had an 11th floor room in the Pyramid although we were offered a tower upgrade (at a price of $20 extra per night) but we declined as we were only staying for two nights. The room itself was very big with two double beds. The amenities were pretty basic but clean. The room itself was quite gloomy as the pyramid windows are tinted and the room lights were quite weak. The bathroom was ok with a large decent walk in shower. One annoyance is there are no room safe therefore you have to use the safety box deposit room by reception which was a bit of a pain! Overall we had a really fun and comfortable stay at the Luxor and we would recommend it to anyone staying for a short break.	
Sep 15 2009 	Make sure you ask for High Floor - rooms smelled - hard beds!	We requested a room for a disabled person since my friend has difficulties in walking. They gave us a room in the East Tower (for handicapped persons/non smoking). The first room on the 4th floor, smelled horrible, the beds were hard and linens were nasty. They moved us to another room on the 15th floor (which smelled even worst) according to the cleaning made a guest had smoked a cigar in this room. I ask if you already know that this room has a problem, how can you move someone there that is complaning about the smoke smell? and the beds were still very hard. After a lot of complaning, they finally moved us to the 17th floor (which had a brand new mattress) and did not smell. I then ask are all the rooms for the handicapped like these?	
Sep 15 2009	Very bad!!!	We were very upset there was no coffee in the room for morning, with as much money that these casino make they could at least provide free internet access and coffee pots in the room. The front line staff that we talked to was very rude, my mother made the comment that we could have stayed at the motel six for cheaper and got better service and ammenities and the person at the front desk said &quot;well maybe you should have&quot;. What ever happened to customer service? The price goes up on the buffett on the weekends whether you want the champagne or not. The other restaurant in the hotel wae went to for breakfast our first morning and waited a half hour before anybody even came to the table. I will never go there again and have already started telling people how bad it was. Also I happened to need a plug in that was by the television stand and there was a ton of trash in back of it as well as an inch of dust. The rooms are worn out and need updating. Again I would not recommend this hotel to anybody. If it were not for the fun we had at the other places in Vegas my grandaughters 21st birthday would have been a total bust.	
Sep 14 2009 	Lovely rooms surprisingly quiet	Stayed here for 4 nights in a Pyramid room. Spacious rooms with 2 double beds, lovely walk in shower. South of the strip so expect a good walk to the main strip hotels etc though excellently built inside. Plenty of restaurants, shops, shows etc. Beware of the extra $12 or so a day they charge you for staying though on top of your bill, as a &quot;required&quot; fee for additional items we never used! Not sure if all main Vegas hotels do this but can be an unexpected bill at the end of you stay, Otherwise great base for Vegas!	
Sep 13 2009 	Great Stay	This was my third stay at the Luxor. We had a great time. It was my father's first trip to Vegas and he thought the hotel was great. It has changed since my last trip. Imax theater is gone and less concentration on the Eqyptian theme. Briefly:Hotel room was fine. We stayed on the fourth floor and did not have to use the Inclinators. Floors 4 and 5 in the pyramid are fun, people watching is great. Having said that, I do not spend much time in the room. If you do, you may want to consider one of the newer hotels at a much higher price.This was the smokiest casino I was in. We pretty much hit them all. It is not going to change; every sad sack I saw camped out on the machines all day had a cigarette in their mouth. If you are sensitive to this, you may prefer another hotel. I think the open design makes it harder to ventilate properly.Overall we enjoyed our stay there very much. Didn't have any of the problems others mentioned. My sense was that the staff there would do anything for you.	
Sep 13 2009 	Fantastic	We stayed at the Luxor for 4nights and thought it was fantastic. All the staff were very helpful, rooms were huge and very clean. Good location not far from the middle of the strip. I would recommend this hotel to everyone.	
Sep 13 2009 	freindly staffgood atmosphere but needs updating	I stayed at the luxor with my partner for a week in september.After reading some poor reviews i went with an open mind.Upon arriving at checkin after 16hours travelling from the UK the service was fast and friendly,i had booked a spa suite but was told by the nice lady at check in that it was on the ground floor with no view.She told us if we were not happy she would arrange a better room the following day,we took our chance and it was fine,hey you dont go to vegas to sit in your room all day looking at the view.The room was clean but did need updating.Dont listen to half the bad reviews you hear,i think some people are born to complain!!!Pool area was great but i would advise paying a few extra dollars to get a cabana or vip loungers as we did ,as you do need some shade during the day when its in the 100s.Steak house was really nice food so to were all the restaraunts in the luxor(did not try the buffet though).Bodys exhibition was really interesting but a bit pricey at $60 for the two of us.The slots in the casino werent very loose but free drinks a plenty with a dollar tip.All in all we enjoyed the luxor,you can find negatives with every hotel and casino in las vegas,just pick out the positives and have a blast and enjoy the gauranteed weather.	
Sep 13 2009 	Loved It	Arrived on a Sunday afternoon had a $25 f&amp;b credit with our internet booking and asked to use it to upgrade our room - said no but offered us an upgrade complimentary to a tower room. The tower room was brilliant, on the 15th floor, with ceiling to floor glass looking over the pool. This was great for us as we would not have liked to walk through the casino to the pool. The room was very clean, spacious and comfortable. The casino is great - most of the staff were very good, the occasional cranky barman. Reception were quick and helpful. We ate at &quot;Tender&quot; and loved the atmosphere and food. Have stayed at Excalibur and MGM and much preferred Luxor. Would love to go back but would ask for the tower room	
Sep 12 2009 	Very Nice	I stayed at Luxor in September 2009. This was my fourth time at the Luxor. As usual, I was impressed. Luxor is a beautiful and unique hotel. The staff were very friendly and cheerful. My room was huge and comfortable. Everything was in working order. The Pyramid Cafe is attractive and the food was superb. I never experience any problems when I stay here. Luxor has some really nice lounges where you can relax and pass the time if you don't feel like gambling. I would recommend this hotel to anyone.	
Sep 11 2009	Great customer service but in need of a make over.	Ok first let me say that the customer service there was amazing at this hotel. All MGM hotels have a great reputation for this to me. My sister and I were able to check in early, but when we got to the hotel room( The Pyramid, not the towers) we were very disappointed. Very old and antiquated- some what dirty too. But the major issue was the actual elavator. Maybe they were trying to make an amusement park ride out of it because it goes up and down real fast and on an weird slant. The really need to do an upgrade for the rooms and the casino too. But again great customer service. I would recommend it to a friend if they like hotel rooms that are not updated.	
Sep 11 2009 	Birthday Fun at Luxor	The Luxor offers a nice casino and decent rooms. The exhibits are always good. We saw the Bodyworks and Titanic. The casino is okay and the atmosphere is always nice. You can't go wrong staying at this one. Good location.The cafe offers decent food which I consider a bonus.	
Sep 9 2009 	Smelly spot for a bachelor party.	The wall mounted (read old) A/C unit in our room leaked. It had been leaking for some time and had started to mildew the carpet in the room. We were eventually upgraded to a suite which was nicer, but still dated. Also, the valet had their 'lot full' signs out when we arrived, luckily we new a back way to allow parking at the 'mall' next door.	
Sep 9 2009 	will never return	First off if anyone know an email address to Luxor Customer Relations I would gladly appreciate you sharing that with me.This was my very first trip to Vegas my husband his cousin and his wife were with us it was the first time for all four. We were extremely excited. On arrival we were hassled by time share people who actully pulled us from the check in line I thought they were check in agents. The agent at the desk who checked us in never made eye contact, was abrupt, and not accomodating to any questions we had keep in mind it's our first trip ever to vegas. I enquired about comp upgrade it's sept everyones back in school the place is not as busy. Her response was you'd have to pay the difference since you already have a low rate...OK not happening...The room was in the pyramid on the fifth floor. My view was off the airport.. Guess what I work for an airline I see airplanes everday all day. This was my view of Vegas. Extremely dissapointed. The room felt like an old hotel room did not compare to what this hotel lookd like from the outside. The television was ancient with limited channels. Beds were ok but no fitted sheets my husband was on the mattress the next morning.We decided to go out on the strip that afternoon this hotel is at the very end of the strip a very far walk to were the action is. But the bus runs to the front and for $7 you can hop on and off 24 hours. Worth it. The next day we planned our day to spend some time at the pool, order some pizza and come back to the room to watch Hangover the movie which the were advertising on the tv. Fisrt the pool very large very beautiful but the worst experience, the temp outside was 105 degrees and for people of my skin color who do not need a tan there were NO umbrella and NO shade unless you can afford a private Cabana. Like I said I JUST work for the airlines. Extremely dissapointed that I had no place to laydown and read my book. After burning in the heat for a bit I went into the pool which was ice cool don't know how that manages but yes..... no comfort zones.Anyway we got our pizza went up to the room and searched for over half hour could not locate the movie. Called down to the front dest my cousin spoke someone who couldn't be bother about such a petty complain as not having a movie availbale that was being advertised. She was rude and part of the conversation she all but called my cousin a liar.We were in total shock over the lack of care and concern for customer.After 3 night which we prepaid for we check out took the bus down the strip and checked into Treasure Island WHAT AN AMAZING DIFFERENCE.Oh one more thing that really upset me was one morning I went to Nathan's for breakfast(it's in the back of the lobby) There was a breakfast platter that contain eggs toast and harsh brown with meat. I asked the girls If I ordered the platter would she subsitute the meat with extra toast I was shocked when she said no. I told her I don't eat pork and I would really preffer to just have some extra toast she then got rude and aging replied NO you can have a bit more harsh brown. What the hell... I was hungry sick of Mcdonalds I got the platter and it only cost a ridiclous 9 dollars.. no extra toast.	
Sep 8 2009 	Typical Vegas	We brought our 3 children to Vegas for a 3 day adventure on our way to Disneyland. To our surprise there were more families then you would have thought. The Luxor was a very large hotel and provided for a lot of walking to get to our parked car. The staff were helpful but did not explain much of the hotels amenities. The room was clean and of a good size. Bathroom could use some renovations. We were able to take in the Titanic Display which was on the upper level and a super thing to see. Worth the money and the time. The monorail was nice to take for free to Excalibur to cut down a little walking. Biggest disappointment would have been the swimming pool. We were in the only shallow pool and asked to move so the life guards could go. Not very nice since it was the only pool our 3 year old could touch bottom in. For a grand style hotel the pool was less then flashy. For a family I would take in hoover Dam as well the M&amp;M store and coca cola store. The kids loved it as well us. If walking at night, be prepared to be offered the many naked woman cards selling sex. How ever when the people saw us as a family they would look away and not offer the cards to my husband. No matter how you slice it, it's Vegas so be prepared if you have kids.	
Sep 8 2009 	Stay Far Away...not worth the price disgusting rooms!	My husband and I traveled to Vegas for a relaxing weekend. We had been at the Luxor before and thought it would be fun to stay in one of the pyramid rooms. Plus, it rating itself as a 4 star hotel, we thought we would be safe. Think again!Check In-Uneventful except for the rude lady who checked us in. Very unfriendly...did not crack a smile or seem even somewhat welcoming.Room-We stayed in a double bed pyramid room. DISGUSTING. That is the best word for this room. We were on floor 15. The elevators going up to the room were run down and smelled like B.O. We walked into the room and that smelled moldy and like B.O. as well. The carpets were disgustingly dirty. The bed was the sickest of all. They don't use fitted sheets, so you end up sleeping on the nasty mattress. The mattress was yellow, bedsheets were thin and mattress was like a board. The lights were very dim, think dark room. The bathroom; however, was decent with great shower pressure. Room service did a very poor job of cleaning up. They left empty shampoo bottles laying around, etc.Casino-not even close to comparable to others. Smelled moldy and smokey. Interesting because we walked into at least 10 other casinos on our trip and they weren't like this. Maybe it's the ventillation? I don't know, but it's not great and not worth the price.Pool-nice. They have a private pool that had some very raunchy parties while we were there. Don't bring your kids here.Sorry, but we are not that picky of a couple and this place was horrible. I would never recommend it--spend an extra $20 a night for a much better hotel.	
Sep 8 2009 	Tower rooms the best option	The first night we arrived we were put in to a room in the Pyramid with 2 beds rather than the king size one we requested (we were on our honeymoon so didn't want separate beds). The room wasn't impressive at all, not very clean, very dark inside and the noise from the casino was very loud. I thought I was going to hate our trip there. We said this to the staff who upgraded us the next day to a junior suite in the Tower part of the hotel (this is the new addition to the hotel). It was so impressive, bright and clean and I loved it. Made the experience totally different! Eating in the hotel was fine, buffet was great value and staff were friendly. The casino in general is dated but a lot of the casinos are like this - old fashioned and a bit grubby. However, I loved it and had a brilliant time and will go back as soon as I can!!	
Sep 8 2009 	Tear It Down	Everything about the Luxor sucks royally. From Valet to state of the rooms, it's a real mess.	
Sep 6 2009 	Think twice about budget room	The hotel itself is very nice. The rooms leave a lot to be desired. The standard room is very, very small. Don't expect much. We had problems from the beginning. Only one of the two room keys worked. After asking to have this corrected twice, we learned to work with one key. This was a real inconvenience because you need a room key to access the elevator. The television was old and a few stations had a scratchy sound. We misplaced the remote for the television and pulled the bed away from the wall to find it. There were cheese curls behind the bed. The bathroom had mold on the ceiling and tub/shower area. the bathroom door was also spotted (about 1/4 of the lower right hand corner). Also, before you can check in, staff tries to sign you up for tours in exchange for show tickets. This wasn't too bad. However, being approached at least three times every time you walk through the lobby/casino is just downright annoying. This is not a good place to stay if you want to spend time together with a spouse/significant other. the bathroom fan was extraordinarily loud. Midnight trips definately wake the roommate. The room service was good. If I had it to do over again, I would have stayed somewhere else. Upon arrival, I asked how much it would cost to upgrade. The front desk informed me theat it would be $240, almost twice what i paid for a few days. The all-day buffet was a good bargain. There is plenty of variety and subtle changes that keep it interesting. Gratuities are not included. Pick a more expensive room and cross your fingers or stay somewhere else.	
Sep 5 2009 	Great Hotel rip off RESORT FEE $11 per night	My 4th time at the hotel and my last. I love the hotel and the pool, the location is slightly out from where its happening but its not far. But for me what really annoyed me was the resort fee. I had paid my rate for the night and then was stung upon check in for - 2 bottles of water, a newspaper and usage of the fitness suite. Now, surely this should be included in the rate? Essentially i paid $11 for 2 miniture bottles of water and a newspaper which wasn't delivered. The resort fee is nothing other than the hotel getting greedy - They reported billion dollar profits, yet have to blatantly rip off guests with this compulsory fee. For that reason i will never stay at the Luxor again. Profit really has come before guest at what was my favourite hotel on the strip. Sad.	
Sep 3 2009 	Rooms shabby and run down... least impressive of all the casinos	I came to vegas expeciting to be wowed... when i first stepped into the hotel I was not! lobby was big and wide but nothing like the glamor id expected from vegas. qued for 40 minutes to be checked in and nearly half an hour to check out (at 11am) the staff werent the least bit friendly as they demanded a credit card. got to the room -pyramid &quot;deluex double&quot;. there was nothing deluex about it. shabby and run down room... worn bed throw... chair in the corner with barely any fabric on it... paint all chipped off the door. can give the room one plus and that was the massive shower. we also got charge $10 a day for two tiny bottels of water and paper which was never even opened and delievered to the room without even asking do you want it!I need to use the internet port to do some internet banking. this takes about 1 min. i had to pay $1 a minute at the hotel computer with a min of 5 mins to be bought before it connects you. further to the above there wasnt the same buzz in the casino as there seemed to be in all the other hotels. apparenlty we had free admission into the club LAX as we were residents of the hotel.... the night the club opened the que was about 500 deep and apparently our names had to be on the list by 8pm before admission. one of the bars offered a night to &quot;hang with chris angel (the magician)&quot; never specified that you had to pay $30 per head for this privilage. decided instead to see his show at the theatre in the luxor and what was to be his believe magic show made me believe nothing of the sort. he performed about 4 tricks. I cant believe i passed on penn and teller to see that crapAll in all had a fantastic time in las vegas! shopping was great to top off the fun to be had everywhere! will go back back but will not be to the luxor.	
Sep 3 2009	Bad Bad Stay Away!	I stayed at the Luxor for my wedding on Aug 21-24, We had our family members meet us there and we got a fairly good rate of $79 for a Fri-Sat nites. When I made the reservations I booked 9 rooms for ourselves and our family members, I asked the reservationist if we could be booked as a group since I was having my wedding there and also dinner reception would follow and Tender Steakhouse. The girl said I needed 10 rooms to quallify as a group but said that she would put it down that we be close and that once we got in to mention it to the front desk and to ask for an upgrade since we were getting married they might upgrade us.Upon arrival we waited in line for 1 hour and when we finally got to the front desk the lady behind the counter asked my future husband to give her his photo id and credit card and said nothing else for 5 minutes. Then I told her that if she had in her notes that we wanted rooms fairly close and we wanted 1 King bed for our room since we were getting married. She quickly gave me a dirtly look and said all the had were 2 Queen rooms in the Pyramid on different floors. I told her what the reservations agent had told me and she said &quot;well they lied&quot;When my husband told her we had a total of 7 rooms booked for our wedding and that we had requested to be close she rolled her eyes and said &quot;I just had a King open up but its on the 3rd floor away from everyone else&quot; My husband said fine we will take it . We are not high maintance people but it was our wedding weekend and we had planned to have a King bed any other time in Vegas we wouldn't care but we were spending over $10,000 on this weekend in their hotel the least they could do is give us a King bed without the attitude.Finally as this front desk agent gave us the keys to our room she looked at me and said &quot;I been married for 32 years and I had 2 queen beds my wedding night&quot; I couldn't belive that she said this My husband got very upset but we were tired from traveling all day and putting up with this bitter womans attitude we just took the keys and went on our way.We were in the 3rd floor close right above the front desk and looking at the casino, the room was run down, not well lit, and the bathroom gave us trouble all weekend long since it kept backing up the sink and the shower as well, call down for maintance to fix and it took 2 hours and 3 more phone calls to finally get someone to take a look. Housekeeping doesn't use fitted sheets on the beds they just use one regular sheet and tuck it in about 1 foot off the bottom of the bed so it always moves and my husband and I ended up sleeping on their nasty mattress. When we told this to the manager on duty he said that is what they use there since they don't use fitted sheets at most hotels.That is not true, both my husband and I have worked at 4-5 star hotels in AZ in the past and not of them used regular sheets instead of fitted sheets. When we told the MOD this he said &quot;Oh we only used this method, I don't know about everybody else&quot; Everything you read on here is true they charge you $12.95 a day for newspaper, water that is not bottled it is municipal water in a bottle, local calls ( I don't know anyone in las Vegas and have a cellphone) they also charge you $14.95 for internet service, $25 for a refrigerator to be placed in the room, and we ordered room service for a couple of snacks 6 chicken wings and 1 chicken quesadilla it was a total of $41.97 unbelievable...Our guests complaint to us about how they were placed over the pool on the 4th floor and the music started at 9 am and went on until 7pm. The only good thing about our wedding was the dinner at Tender it was very good and well priced, other than that everything else was bad, bad, $64 for bodies for 2 ppl, Tacos and Tequila was very expensive $15 for 3 carne asada tacos and bad service and very loud dinning room they have music blaring its very hard to hear anyone, and our waiter was busy with the table next to us that had 4 girls flirting with him and he never even came to take our plates after we were done eating he just handed us our check didn't even refill our drinks or ask us if we wanted anything else stay away from T&amp;T.Pyramid cafe was ok, nothing special and the casino was ok I did win some money at blackjack but nothing out of the ordinary. Overall if I had to do it again I probably pick another hotel this place has gone down hill and it looks like they are just either understaffed or don't care about the guests. This is no 4 star place try more like 2 stay away and save yourself a bunch of headaches.	
Sep 3 2009 	A Break from the hectic!	Luxor was a great hotel, if that's all your expecting. We got a free upgrade to the East tower and, though the novelty of staying in the pyramid was part of choosing Luxor in the first place, the room was great. The location of the hotel was perhaps the only slight problem. It was a fair travel from the Luxor to the main areas you'll want to be on the Strip which on one hand can be a bit of a pain. On the other hand we found it a nice quiet hotel, away from the buzz and in some places sleaze of the Strip. Great for young couples and one of the better choices for families.	
Sep 2 2009 	Great town shame about the hotel	Luxor LasVegas has made efforts to move away from the Egyptian theme, especiallay on the main floor of the hotel, pitty they forgot about the very tired and drab rooms. Our spa room had a huge spill stain in the carpet, other furniture was badly marked and chiped. USA today may be a good paper but traveling from the UK it ment nothing along with the free US calls and 2 bottles of water for $10 every day  ROOMS NEED AN UPDATENew exibitions where very good but on the expensive side.	
Sep 1 2009 	Sisters 60th bday	10 of us rented 5 rooms at the Luxor for a birthday bash. Took a limo from the airport. Fun ride got us out of their fast. (It was 115 degrees.) Check in was quick and correct. Had a room in the East tower. Nice clean quiet room. Easy to get to! Had a great time gambling the slots. My wife and my mother were top winners. The staff was fairly pleasant. The were very busy. But were always helpful. The only thing we did not like was the T&amp;T Lounge. We went in two different times. It was a cold feelings place. No eye contact with the staff, they would only take care of you if they were ready. oops. The pool was great, not deep. Rent a cabana if it is hot, they are great.  We all had a great time. Thank You Luxor and VegasLuxor allows you to walk bew	
Sep 1 2009 	More Buffet excellant.	Just a word of praise for the More Buffet, at Luxor in Las Vegas. We celebrated our 40th. Wedding Anniversary in August 2009. We had a vow renewal at Graceland Chapel, and we held our small reception, at the More buffet, at the Luxor. Just wanted to add a great big &quot;Thank You&quot;, to all involved. They made our day, extra special,and we were treated like royalty. We ordered a cake, and celebration cookies, all online, and everything was just perfect. All the guests, complemented the prime rib, and said it was the best prime rib, that they had tasted in buffets, at Las Vegas. So anyone wanting a celebration in Vegas, I would recommend the Luxor. Pat and Ron Pargeter. West Midlands, England.	
Sep 1 2009 	Wonderful stay	My husband and I recently came back from Vegas staying at the Luxor, this is the first time we have stayed here and I loved it. I have stayed at the Imperial Palace, Excalibur and New York New York but the Luxor was very impressive, especially the lobby and registration area. The machines and tables are placed well apart from each other, not crammed together like the other hotels. Even though the Luxor is at the southern end of the strip it is no problem to walk the connecting bridges to the other casinos or catch The Duece down the strip to the others. I found that there is quite a variety of eateries to suit all pockets, we especially liked the Pyramid Cafe for breakfast. I found the staff helpfull and the machines were kind to us. I would recommend this hotel to others, we will be coming back next year. I can't wait..	
Aug 31 2009 	Great Stay - perfect for young couples!	I was very worried when I read the bad reviews for this hotel before we left - but our stay was fantastic. We booked a pyramid room but asked for an upgrade, and got a tower king room for no extra cost - the helpful staff wouldn't accept a tip for the change.The room was very spacious, clean and comfortable with a huge tub and shower. The lobby, bars and casino were 5*. The bars and nightclub were funky and the hotel had a great selection of cool places to eat. This is a great value hotel and well worth a visit.The only bad thing about the hotel was it's location on the strip, at the far end of one side. Having said that, we were still able to walk to the main strip area in 15-20mins, and there are bus links and taxis available from outside the hotel. Getting to and from the airport is much cheaper to this hotel than to the main strip area, so it all balances out.	
Aug 30 2009 	Don't Bother	We stayed here (in the Tower) in 2000 and thought it was great. So this time we thought that we would stay in the Pyramid. Big mistake!! We booked a king bed room and got a dismal 6th floor room with 2 queen beds. The room was dimly lit and badly in need of a make-over. It's the first time we've stayed in a hotel where the room carpet was patched!The house keeping was inadequate as there was a sticker from someone's camera lens packaging on the floor. The bathroom had some packaging from a previous guest's medication on the floor. The 6th floor corridor carpets were ruffled and seemed to need cleaning or replacing.The hotel markets itself as an upscale resort. The only thing that we could see that was upscale was the price of food and drinks.We definitely wouldn't stay here again or recommend the place to anyone.	
Aug 30 2009 	Good Value Mid Range Hotel for Staying in Vegas	We stayed here for a week in November last year. It was fairly cheap considering it's a four star hotel on the strip. It was our first time in Vegas and so it took some getting used to being in such a massive hotel with all the shops, restaurants, shops, casino, clubs etc. It's quite strange staying a couple of floors above all of that stuff! The service was quite impersonal but with the vast amount people checking in and staying there hardly surprising. the room was very nice as was the bathroom. We didn't have a good view as we had a cheap room, but we didn't really care. We never got to the pool so can't comment on that! We had a fabulous meal in the steakhouse there (v. expensive but v. lovely!) There was some rennovation going on when we stayed there which was a bit of a shame but if these things need doing not much they can do about it. It was what we expected nothing spectacular but perfectly adequate.	
Aug 30 2009 	Don't listen to any negative reviews about this hotel	My wife and I returned back from a 7-night stay at the Luxor for our Honeymoon and the only thing that would really sum up our stay was &quot;Perfect&quot;. This is the second time we have stayed at the Luxor in this year, We stayed in a Pyramid Spa Suite, which is slightly more expensive than the budget deluxe suites, but not massively expensive. The check in queue was about 20-mins at 5pm so more than bareable, and the person dealikng with us was both very polite and helpful. She never mentioned anything about a &quot;resort fee&quot;, maybe because we booked through an external web site (Lastminute.com).The room itself was really nice. Clean, no sign of aging, very nicely decorated and not to dark at all as others had mentioned. We had towels all folded nicely for both the shower room and the hot tub. These were changed daily. Didn't see any sign of wear or tear on any hallways either as has been suggested.We did have one small problem with the battery failing on our door meaning we couldn't gain access, but with a quick visit to reception, someone came to our room within 5 minutes. Great service with such a huge hotel.The hotel itself is a marvel! It's such a HUGE foyer. The atrium level has a good range of fast food outlets, and the Titanic exhibition is definately worth a visit. Do expect to pay a lot during your stay though! A beer will cost you around £5 but if you are gambling they are free, although DO tip so they keep coming back!The time share people are easily avoided by just saying &quot;no thanks&quot; and they back off straight away. They are just trying to earn a living like everyone else. Pool is huge and plenty of room for everyone although it gets more full and lively on Friday through Sunday with all the college kids arriving!Nice selection of restaurants through Mandalay Place which links the luxor and Mandalay Bay, and you have to try the Minus 5 bar where everything is made of ice, chairs, walls, tables, statues and glasses etc. Very cool - excuse the pun.Overall, I couldn't fault the trip, it was exactly what we had hoped for and more. Will hopefully go back in the very near future. Please don't listen to any bad reviews. Go and experience how great the place is.	
Aug 30 2009 	Pay a little more and go to Caesar's Palace	We were travelling as a family with 2 teenagers. On arrival at the Luxor we opted to pay a premium of 20$ a room in order to get two interconnecting rooms. These rooms were in the tower. We were told these rooms were superior and newer than the pyramid rooms. I am glad we paid the extra as rooms in the pyramid open directly to a corridor open to the interior void of the pyramid above the very noisy (24 hour noise!) casino  and are not recommended for anyone who is a light sleeper or does not like heights. Our tower rooms were quiet - but very gloomy, with insufficient lights. There were also insufficient pillows, insufficient towels, and the toiletries were none too generous. The shower was in dire need of a renovation and looked more 1 star than 5 star. I dread to think what the older bathrooms in the pyramid were like! The resort fee (not optional) mentioned by other reviewers is totally unjustifiable. We could not walk through the resort without being approached repeatedly by people trying to sell us something. The Titanic and Body exhibitions in the resort looked interesting but on enquiring the cost we discovered it would have been 200$ for 4 of us. We declined! At check out there were errors on the bill  we had not been credited the correct value for our food and beverage credit. This was grudgingly changed.If you can afford a little extra  stay at Caesars Palace. The rooms are better, the ambience is better, the location is better, the facilities are better, the staff are better  everything is better!	
Aug 29 2009 	Not what it's all cracked up to be	Booked to stay at the Luxor for 4 nights. We booked with Travelocity and were promised a $25 food and beverage credit within the hotel. We were really excited to stay here and when we checked in we were charged the $12/night resort fee and were told that if we wanted to use the food and beverage credit, the hotel would have to charge my credit card $400.00 ($100/night) which would be refunded later if it wasn't used. We didn't do this because we weren't comfortable with just giving up a bunch of money that we could potentially use at the hotel. Why they couldn't just give us gift cards for the credit is beyond me. There were 4 of us travelling and had booked 2 rooms, we were told that there were no King beds left so we would have to have 2 beds per room. Travelocity claims that it is either 1 KIng or 2 Queens. . . this is not true, it is actually 2 Double beds. Not Cool! OUr hotel room was also on the 3rd floor and when you opened the door all you could hear was the loud noise of the Casino. Sleep was a little hard to come by because of the noise of the casino. My wife also found stains on our sheets. We could have stayed at a hotel with a better location for about the same price but were lured in by the cheesy pyramid theme. We will definitely stay somewhere else the next time we're in Vegas. . . Luxor is pretty far from a lot of stuff so we would rather stay more in the central strip. . . Bottom line. . . don't stay here, the resort fee pays for nothing (you get the paper every morning and 2 mini bottles of water. . . not worth $10), the rooms aren't very nice, the buffet is nothing to write home about, the pool is a glorified wading pool that is only 3 feet deep, and its at the south end of the strip away from the good stuff. . . spend $10 more / night and stay someplace nicer!	
Aug 29 2009 	A nice experience	Me &amp; my family of 4 (2 kids), stayed at the Luxor for 3 nights at the beginning of August. First of all I selected this hotel over others because, as one of the adverts about the hotel states, &quot;its hip to be triangular&quot;. It was a really nice experience living in a pyramid! We arrived on a Saturday afternoon (about 3.30pm) and there was no queing at all for check-in. The rooms were spacious, confortable and the dim lighting effect is superb. What do you need all that light for? You're only going to sleep in the room! As regards the amenities in the hotel, they are fantastic. There are shows, food court, exhibitions. You name it. And the pool is also amazing! What can I say? It was a nice experience.	
Aug 27 2009 	Run-down dirty horrible service.	We thought the Luxor would be a great place to spend 4 days in Vegas.. wrong. When we got there we waited in a long line to check in, then when we got to our room there was a hair in the bed and the sheets were stained. One of the days housekeeping didn't close our door all the way so our room was open &amp; unlocked for the whole day, when we went to management about it all they did was comp us $40 in their cafe. Our sink took a while to drain so they had maintenance come fix it, which was nice, but they didn't clean anything up &amp; there were chunks of nasty stuff all over the bathroom counter. Lastly, we ate in their cafe &amp; it had horrible service, the waiting staff was slow &amp; we waited 45 minutes for the waitress to come get our check so we could get a receipt. We made our reservations over the phone &amp; they quoted us a price, which was very reasonable.. but when we got to the hotel the price was much more with hidden fees &amp; they wouldn't adjust it at all. Overall we were not happy with our experience at the Luxor, we would recommend a nicer hotel &amp; something more central on the strip.	
Aug 27 2009 	Do not believe the '5 star' luxury ratings this place is hell!	We stayed in the Pyramid, which was suppose to be the more luxurious part. The rooms were awful. Very dark, no proper light. The 'over-size' shower was just a massive shower cubicle with a tiny rusty showerhead at 1 end.There were clean and comfy but just horrible. The amenities in the Luxor compared to other hotels were awful. A few fast-food places and ridiculously expensive restaurants. DO NOT have the buffet, food is awful.Pool was ok but just huge, no shade, and very noisey at weekends. The only good thing about Luxor was the cheap price - you get what you pay for.	
Aug 27 2009 	OK	My family of 5 stayed here for 4 nights - 16 to 20 August 2009. The checking in was horrendous and it took us an hour +. Very disappointed with our two rooms in the Pyramid, firstly as they were not adjoining as requested but also they were dingy and grubby looking and had a strange smell. There was a lamp missing in one of the rooms which made it even darker and the air conditioning system didn't work efficiently in either rooms. One of the rooms had hardly any hangers, the iron and ironing board had seen better days and the pillows stank. I had a peek at the mattress and wished I hadn't! I went to see a manager about the smelly pillows and about getting a lamp and he offered us two rooms in the Tower for the next day which I accepted without hesitation. These were far superior, cleaner and overall had a better atmosphere. I found the staff very polite and helpful and not at all rude. The pool area was nice with plenty of fresh towels but was often very crowded with no beds available except for the $200 a day cabanas. We tried the all day buffet for $24.99 pp which was for us the cheapest way of eating and drinking with a good variety of food, including salads, fruit and vegetables. There were no tea/coffee making facilities in the rooms or a laundry room so the only way to get a cup of tea or get some washing done was to pay the expensive services within the hotel. I was desperate to get some laundry done as we had already been away for over a week in San Francisco and had quite a lot piling up with 5 of us so had to use their in-room laundry service which was extortionate although everything was done very well and wrapped in tissue paper! There wasn't anything for the teens to do in the hotel itself but lots of arcades and games for them in the adjoining Excalibur. Our kids enjoyed the experience but my husband and I felt lacklustre about the whole place and will not be returning. A word of warning though - beware the Grangeview representatives standing around the hotel who look like Luxor staff. They are not. They are in fact offering cheap entertainment tickets in exchange for your time (and money) at a timeshare presentation. We got sucked in and ended up at their timeshare headquarters for over 4 hours and unable to escape as they transported us (and other fools) in their own mini bus. If you are willing to give up half a day of absolute crap and pressure selling to buy a timeshare for cheap shows then go ahead but just thought I would warn others as we were pretty niave about it all. Overall the hotel was OK but very impersonal and my husband and I were glad to get away to our next destination.	
Aug 26 2009 	Fantastic Place. Amazing Pool!	I loved to stay in this Hotel! I recommend it to everyone going to Las Vegas.Good price for a very good quality! Marvellous location!	
Aug 26 2009 	You can do Vegas on the cheap 	It was our first time in Vegas, and the Luxor was the perfect choice. The Luxor has unique character, it's not a plain unmemorable hotel. I chose a Pyramid room because it was different, and ours on the 18th floor was just as expected, &amp; the view was of golden Mandalay Bay. The sideways moving elevators are a cool feature. I noticed the casino wasn't especially hopping any time of the day or evening we walked through it. The casino didn't matter to us though, as we don't gamble. You can also do Vegas on the cheap, lots of money isn't required. We listened to The Grandview at Las Vegas Resort timeshare &amp; received 2 show tickets and $125 to spend at the Luxor, MGM Grand or Excalibur. We booked our trip through Itravel2000 (flew with Air Canada), because many hotels include 2 show tickets with the package. We saw Criss Angel's Believe Cirque du Soleil show which I found to be a good mix of his freakishness with the dancing and illusions. Fantasy was alright, not top notch nor bottom of the barrel. It had it's good moments. We shopped at Fashion Show Mall and Las Vegas Outlet Center, and preferred the latter. It was more of the regular residential type mall I was looking for, not as touristy ($$expensive!). They have some decent quality, reasonably priced stores. Our best meal was at Tamba Indian Cuisine. It's located at the Hawaiian Marketplace, the covered outdoor plaza with cart vendors on the strip. Tasty food, very impressed. The MGM and Luxor buffets were fine. Forget about drinking at bars or casinos, we bought our alcohol (beer, coolers) at convenience stores at a much lower cost. One of the main things we went to Vegas for was the Grand Canyon, which of course didn't disappoint. We chose Sweettours South rim trip, and were extremely pleased with everything. The decent sized breakfast (mini muffins, oj, banana, granola bar) gets you going. The Hoover Dam stop is quick, which I feel is just right, as there's not that much to see. We stopped for lunch (sandwich &amp; little bag of chips &amp; cookies) at Brown Bag Sandwich Shoppe in Williams, AZ. We had a bit of time there to check out some of the neat shops. There's plenty of cold bottled water on the bus throughout the trip. Having 3 hours at the Canyon is ideal. The stops and movies that are played to &amp; from makes the time go quicker. When you go down each side of the strip once, you get the point. Walking through all the casinos to get anywhere is tedious. Take the monorail and give yourself a bit of a break from some walking and the heat. I'd say that 4 nights in Vegas is the right amount of time, not too long.	
Aug 26 2009 	Would not recommend to anyone	Took 2 hours to check in-literally! This is no exageration. Once we were checked in they did not have a King size bed, just 2 queens. We could have gone back the next day but absolutely not willing to wait in line for 2 hours again. Noticed on the second day that ants were all over the room, even in the bed. Lastly, the location stinks. It's far from the main part of the strip and takes a 30-45 minute walk just to get up there. We spent so much of our time exhausted from the walk then enjoying our stay. Much nicer hotels in better locations	
Aug 25 2009	I was SOOO disappointed!	I was really excited because we had a group of 14 people to bring to Vegas for my girlfriends birthday. It was the first time i ever stayed at the Luxor. Check in was a nightmare and they didnt have enough employees to handle all of the people in line. We waited 45 minutes to check in. The room smelled bad as soon as we walked in. The blankets were rough and itchy. The air conditioner only half worked. We stayed there for 3 nights and ran it full blast 24/7. The room was never what i would consider a &quot;comfortably cool&quot; temperature. The remote didnt work for the television and when i called someone to come up and fix it or check the batteries, he was very rude and acted extremely inconvenienced by the task he was sent for. Day 2 in the middle of a shower the water stopped running! I was left to stand in the room while shampoo dried to my head. I called and there was no reason given...just looking into the problem. 45 minutes later the water was turned back on as the dried crusted shampoo started to crack and flake off of my head. I will never return to this hotel nor would i recommend it to a friend.	
Aug 25 2009 	Amazing building but average rooms - just geared to the casino!	Everything here - like the rest of the resort is over thetop. Both posively and negatively. I agree with other reviewers - the check in queue is unacceptably long. Room was average - good view, but a bit dated and shabby. It was clear they just want you to spend most of your time on the casino floor. Lots of entertainment, but all pay per view and expensive. We ate at company which was very expensive and poor value for money. Another night we ate in the tacos and tequila outlet which was much better and reasonable prices. The pool area was impressive but overcrowded. I thought it was decidely average overall and would not go back for the price we paid!	
Aug 25 2009 	Good experience there are nicer hotels	I have stayed at the luxor twice now. It is a fine hotel, the staff are fine, the rooms have always been fine, and the casino and everything is fine. We booked the luxor for the price. It is a little far away from the other casinos like Belaggio and Caesers etc. But we spent a lot of time in the tropicana, New York New York, and MGM Grand. I think next time I will try to spring for a little classier hotel, as the Luxor seems less glamorous than some others.	
Aug 24 2009 	Too far from the action needs a renovation not a 4 star	Stayed at the Luxor for 5 nights for Memorial Day Weekend 2009. The pros of staying at the Luxor is that they have a food court (Quiznos,McDonald's, Starbucks, etc.). and the Pyramid Cafe (good for breakfast.) You can walk to Mandalay Bay (which houses House of Blues-good for lunch, RumJungle-ridiculous cover but awesome club) via an indoor walkway (that has some nice shops and restaurants.) You can also walk to Excalibur (and maybe catch The Tournament of the Kings show, or a frozen drink from Dick's Last Resort) without leaving the Luxor.Its very affordable, and the staff is really nice and responsive. However, the rooms are a little worn, the beds are uncomfortable and its kinda at the end of the strip. They charge you 14.99 per day for internet that isn't wireless (there is a strange patch cable apparatus on the side of the TV that connects you to the internet.) Our iron didn't work, we asked for another and that didn't work either...this pissed me off because I didn't get to wear my freak um dress as I was unable to iron it. We had an anti-walker in the group so we ended up peeling for cabs quite often just to get to the middle of the strip. I would stay there again if I got a great deal only because I didn't spend much time in the room anyhow, but The Luxor shouldnt be listed as a 4 star hotel....its more of a 3 star.	
Aug 24 2009 	Good place!! Not expansive	I reserved a room in february and I found a good price!!!! Clean, silent and large room for 65$!!!	
Aug 24 2009 	Stayed for a week that was enough!	My now husband and I travelled to Las Vegas earlier this month from Australia to, yep, get married in Vegas. As the Luxor was going to be incorporated into our Honeymoon, I wanted this to be a hotel to remember. Which it is, but not for all the reasons I wanted it to be.Firstly, it took over an hour to check in. Which is fine, whatever, we had already been used to lining up all day from the airport to the shuttle to arrive there. When we finally did get to the front of the line, we spoke to a Receptionist who quite frankly shouldn't be in her role dealing with Customers as she was very frank and not that friendly. I asked if there were any nicer rooms available as we were getting married, and she said promptly that the only upgrade available would be for an extra $20 US a night, and the only difference to that room was that there was a bath in the room also. Woo...hoo? We politely declined.Also, the service fee they charge of $10.95 US a day we thought was a little crazily priced, considering we had prebooked and prepaid everything back in OCTOBER, and there was no such fee ever discussed with our travel agent that we had to pay for this on top of what we paid for the hotel up until you're checking in. They don't really give you much choice when you're already there!On top of these fees, Luxor wanted to charge $15 US a day for having internet in your hotel room - pass! Also around $25 US for a Fitness Center pass. They gave nothing away for their guests!We were up on Level 15, facing the pool which was quiet enough of a nighttime to get sleep without having to worry about the sounds of the LAX nightclub that is downstairs. You can definitely tell when its a LAX night with the way the women are dressed trying to get into the club for free!Downstairs in the actual gambling areas, the service was great. The drinks ladies came around quite regularly and I definitely recommend signing up for a free MGM Players Club Card as you will be recouped for your gambling. My husband &amp; I ended up getting $130 in free casino credit, which we used to go out for dinner our last night there.Overall, the experience was mediocre. If I was to go back to Vegas, I wouldn't stay here again just because I didn't feel like I was special to the hotel - just another booking; and I wanted to feel more special than that when I was a Bride To Be.	
Aug 24 2009 	The good the bad and the...	i would give this place a B-. if you are expecting a very nice room, then i would suggest upgrading to a spa suite. the room we had had no fridge and the bathroom was a little outdated. the beds were really flat. our room was a far walk from the elevator and pool, i was expecting it to be more like the mgm rooms, but it was not. it's like the Tropicana in Luxor. location is great, shows, etc.. thoough, so if your not a big room person it's ok. i think this place is for people like college students, not professionals or couples, seeking the frills.pool was ok, but it looks nicer in the pics.	
Aug 23 2009 	Not all it's cracked up to be...	My wife and I stayed at the Luxor for 1 week in December from 26th to the 2nd of Jan.We heard good things from people who had stayed there before, and our travel agent also had good feed back from people he had stay there. Now we are not fussy people but as soon as we walked into the luxor it just looked filthy, and the stale smell of somke in the lobby was overpowering. After we checked in we headed on a trek to find our room, it took 20min to find the room and when we did its was very dirty looking, the ceiling was yellow from smoke (it was a non smoking room) and the carpets were mankey. I know its an egyptian themed hotel and is supposed to look &quot;old&quot; but unclean as well? The main problem we had with this hotel was its location, it is at the very end of the srtip and is really awarked to walk to any hotel from there except The Mandalay bay which is 100 times the hotel the Luxor is. fresh and clean smelling and bright!! We decided to go to the Gym the second day we were there only to find out that we had to pay $20 for an unairconditioned pokey Gym!! This hotel is not worth the money	
Aug 23 2009 	Motel 6 Quality in a Pyramid - AVOID	We got a deal on a room at the Luxor and were doing a quickie weekend Vegas trip, so we decided to go with it. We both had stayed at the Luxor years ago and had a good experience. In my opinion, the Luxor has gone down hill. I will start with its two good points - the location on the strip (being connected to Mandalay and Excalibur and near MGM) and its variety of food choices on site including fast food on its Atrium level - both good points. This is where the good ends for the Luxor however! It is a particularly dark hotel and I am guessing they keep it dark to hid the fact that it is worn down and poorly kept. We stayed in a Pyramid Deluxe room facing the pool (which even 12 floors up the music was insanely loud). We started out in a 2nd floor room 10 feet from the taxi stand (seriously) with no working AC. It blew warm air - it was 107 when we checked in outside and about that inside. They did not seem to care, but we did ask for another room and were moved to the 12th floor. The AC blew coolish air (not cold) and the room was just worn down. The beds sagged. The TV was about 15 years old. The chairs looked worn and dirty. When you took a shower the drain backed up. Not to mention the key cards worked only about 1/2 the time. I could go on, but why - it was BAD - even for a deal. Avoid it. There are better deals on the strip. The Luxor is not one of them.	
Aug 22 2009 	Just OK	The hotel itself and the rooms were pretty nice. We had a spa suite that was very spacious and had a decent view. The inclinators, instead of elevators are a real hoot!For once when staying in Vegas our room was not a mile away from the elevator and ice machine. What a nice surprise! Overall the hotel was expensive, and the drinks were ridiculous! $6 for a beer in the bar and $7 for a beer at the pool.My complaints about the room were: 1. No coffee pot 2. no shelf in the shower to put your shampoo on 3. sofa was only a loveseat, and did not pull out into a bed 4. maids never left enough towels 5. maids never left clean glasses in our roomThe bell staff was very quick, even though when we called down they always said it would be a long wait, it never was. The rest of the staff was lacking in most service areas!The check in line was ridiculously long! We waited for 1/2 an hour, but I suppose we're lucky as we saw it 4 times longer that what we waited in. The line to buy show tickets was also ridiculously long and slow! You had to wait in the same line to buy tickets for the Titanic exhibit as to buy tickets for the shows. This should not have been! The shows must not have had much business as the hotel was constantly leaving messages on our phone wanting us to buy tickets. It took the maids all day to service our room. We were literally the last room they did. I'm sorry, but if you're paying for an expensive suite you should have had a little better service. One day the valet was very quick, the next very slow. We did not understand why we were not permitted to take our luggage to our room on a cart by ourselves. It was against the hotel policy. That's one I've never encountered before. They try to milk you for all the tips they can. I think there was only 1 cashier in the whole casino, at least that's all we could find. Although the rooms still have an Egyptian theme it is very sad that the rest of the hotel does not anymore. It has completely lost its charm! I loved the Nile River ride and miss the Egyptian museum and IMAX. The Titanic exhibit is interesting, but it's a shame that they did away with their theme to accomodate theaters for shows that they apparently can't sell enough tickets for.	
Aug 22 2009 	Massive hotel pretty good service	August in Las Vegas is great if you like it about 40 degress c (105 F)! Everywhere is air conditioned though, including areas of the street where is water blown through fans. Luxor is pretty much at the end of the new strip. A really nice area - very tourist orientated - a typical Vegas hotel and casino though definitely one of the nicer ones. Luxor has everything you could need in the hotel pretty much - bars (same price as every other hotel), casino (not that you're expected to use it), average quality buffet, more fast food and quality restaurant food than you can get through in a week, spa, gym, starbucks x 3, convenience stores etc etc etc. This is a capitalist business as well as a hotel though - they do employ staff to persuade you into offers at their entertainment stands - they're very charming but will leave you alone if you are clear you're not interested. Travelled with my cousin who sometimes needs a wheelchair - bell services only too happy to arrange one with security on our arrival and offered to hire one for rest of the stay if needed. Hotel is MASSIVE however - we had three rooms and although two were close together, the third was about a 15 minute walk away...! They did offer to move this allocation to a closer room when one became available however. Rooms all huge - our standard room had 2x queen size beds, sofa, table and chairs... As the hotel is on the strip, it is on &quot;The Deuce&quot; bus route - very frequent 24 hour bus $3 single ticket or $7 for a 24 hour ticket which runs from dowtown, through the entire strip to the Las Vegas Outlet. Exact change only - buy tickets on bus or at RTC machines near some bus stops. Would definitely stay here again.	
Aug 22 2009 	Bed Bugs at Luxor Las Vegas	First of all, my family and I are very disappointed and disgusted at how Luxor chose to deal with the bed bug infestation. We were in room 12095. If you were staying within 9 rooms of this vicinity and suddenly got an upgrade to a different room and they didn't tell you why, you know why now. My cousin was sleeping in the bed for 5 hours due to illness but when I got her up I noticed a blood stain near her head. Then I saw a couple red bugs sitting on the bed and the pillows. When I killed them, blood came out so I suspected foul play. They locked all of our things in the room (minus purses and toiletries) for more than 3 hours. We were relocated to another room but we couldn't change our clothes or shower because we didn't have any of our things. They called us at 3am to come back to the room for our things. They put them in bags and told us that we could not take it back. We had to (get this) TAKE OUR LUGGAGE IN THE MORNING TO THE LAUNDROMAT 3 MILES AWAY. I asked them to at least give us something to change into and the night manager said, &quot;I wouldn't worry, if there were bugs, they should have fallen off by now&quot;. Later, at 5am they sent me a shirt and sweat pants. The next morning, after little sleep, we had to drive our things to the laundromat and it took us 3 hours to do 3 loads of wash. I had never been to the laundromat before, so this was super annoying. The night manager told her to come speak with her at 7pm when her shift started but at this point, we didn't want to wait around again for Luxor to do something about this. Keep in mind, 2 managers into this, they never apologized once for our discomfort and psychological damage. We couldn't really enjoy our Vegas stay for 17 hours at this point. We spoke with another manager for 2 hours. He tried to talk us into accepting comped buffet and a 1 night return voucher but we had to sign some liability crap which would mean that if we chose to go a legal route later on, this would not be possible. We refused and got on the phone with my lawyer. The manager talked with risk management and he said he could offer us comped buffet and a 2 night stay with payment for laundromat. And they would also pay for our hospital bill to get a check up for the bed bug bites. (We couldn't see any yet, but I found 2 later on). We agreed to the comped things now, and left the potential for legal action open.So, Luxor sucks in all ways. We wasted 2 days of our precious vacation time. We are still pissed off.	
Aug 21 2009 	Do NOT stay at the Luxor. Bad customer service and horrible beds!!!	Check in lines where always too long. Waited 45 minutes in line to have the front desk tell us that there was not a King bed available. He advised we could have either upgraded in the tower for $20/night or return back to the dreaded long line at 3pm-5pm to check back again to see if it was available. Since this was unacceptable to us we demanded a simple notification text to let us know when it was available WITHOUT staying in the check out line. I was angry that the front desk clerk didn't even offer to do this. Also the beds are EXTREMELY uncomfortable, the mattress feels like a pull out couch mattress. I've stayed downtown and have been in better beds.The last that will detour us from the Luxor is the pool RULES. We didn't like how we couldn't have our drinks in the pool. Getting harrassed by a lifeguard for doing something that every other Vegas pool I've been in allows is embarrassing. Apparently you don't want your guests to have a good time or buy drinks while they're at the pool.	
Aug 21 2009 	OK hotel	We actually stayed here when it was new in 1994. It was lovely then. I don't recall any restaurants that stood out.Since we have been back to LV 2-3 times per year each year, we have thought less of it. However, it was undergoing construction when we last saw it in 2008. It used to be a great hotel. The only downside is that the rooms all face inward toward the casino. I remember we heard a couple fighting about how they lost all their money. Construction may be complete now, but noise level from casino to room was high. They do have great deals, but it is not the best on the strip. I would rather stay here than an equal value hotel like Excalibur or the Sahara, etc.	
Aug 21 2009 	It was a wonderful Experience	I'm glad that I didn't read the last lot of negative reviews or I may not have stayed at the Luxor. We had a wonderful overnight stopover. I had read peoples complaints in regards to the length of time you had to wait to check in and the resort fee so I was prepared for both. There was a long que when I checked in but, there was an equally large number of staff handling it. The young man checking us in was great, he gave us an upgrade to the east tower and when I showed disappointment about not staying in the pyramid he gave me the option of a room in the pyramid or adjusting my ticket so I could ride the lift up to look down from the top of the pyramid I chose the latter. It's probably old dills like me first time out of Australia holding up friendly polite staff that makes people wait longer than they think they should. I told him a couple of times that I owed for the Resort fee and he told me that I was fully paid and owed nothing. Instead of winging about what the $10 odd is for why not add it onto the overall cost of the room and it's still great value for money. The whole Egyptian atmosphere of the place was incredible. I find it unbelievable how such a magnificent structure was built. Our room was excellent - non smoking - modern - clean and neat. My wife's only complaint was no fridge like we always get in Australia, but then we never get an ice machine in the hallway outside. After reading people's complaints and poor ratings of the Luxor, I'm wondering if I stayed in the same establishment. The one I stayed at was the one with the big Pyramid. I'm hoping for a longer stay before leaving the US in 5 weeks.	
Aug 20 2009 	Do not stay at the Luxor!!!	I want to start this review off with I DO NOT AND WILL NOT EVER RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL TO ANYONE!!!!! If it wasn't for the hotel room my vacation would have been completely amazing. When you walk into the Luxor it looks so amazing and nice that you get really excited and you feel like you have made a good choice on the hotel you chose to stay at and be happy with it. NOT! It started off with the check in. After waiting in line for about an hour the lady at the front desk gave us the run around and a confusing explination about why our room was not ready/ available anymore. So she told us to upgrade to the tower rooms for and extra $70! And we did figuring it was what needed to be done. The tower was super far off and away from everything else and you needed a map to find out where to go and to make sure that you picked the right elevator to get on. After seeing that room and not being happy with it we called to complain and wanted to go back to the pyramid where we ORIGINALLY made reservations to stay. They said they would move us and refund the money. Then went all the way back to the front desk and waited AGAIN to get a room. When we got to the front they gave us our ney key and informed us that the extra money that we paid would not be refunded to us until we checked out a few days later! So we went right up to our room after figuring out all those confusing elevators. The minute you walked in all you could do was notice the strong smell of wet towels! After getting past that, You notice that all the curtains are stained from where sometime in the past water must have been leaking. there were water spots everywhere. And let me point out that it wasnt a small spot. These were feet long!!! Throughout the room there were dirty marks all over the walls and paint that was scratched and chipping! In the bathroom there was mold in the corners of the shower and pieces of tile falling off around the bottom of the walls. The bed was super uncomfoftable and left me with back and neck pain throughout the whole trip. I don't know about most people but I am very private with my things. When we left our room we put the privacy sign on there so that no housekeeping would be in there around our things. And when we came back later that day, HOUSEKEEPING WAS IN THERE ANYWAY!!! They walked around when all our stuff was out which made me feel kind of violated to have my things out like that and have someone that I didnt know around and with them. We had a pile/section where we threw our dirty clothes in a corner and they pushed them together into a neater pile!!! And when they left they took our privacy sign with them! They made our bed but did not change the sheets which I knew because of a stain on one of them. The towels were super scratchy and almost see through! We contemplated taking the ones from the pool since they were a thousand times better then the ones they gave us in our room. Overall I give this hotel the lowest lowest possible score!!! DO NOT STAY HERE IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A GOOD VACATION!	
Aug 20 2009 	Luxor was AWESOME!	We loved our stay at the Luxor. We stayed only 2 nights at the excellent rate of $49/night. Booked in April so was only charged the $5 resort fee not the $10.95 they now charge. Had to speak to someone at front desk twice about this but was not charged in the end. We got upgraded for free to a tower room because they apparently had no king non-smoking in the pyramid by the time we checked in on Sunday night. WE had to take 2 queens instead of the king but that was not a problem and it was super nice. I LOVED the huge tub and bathroom. The bed was extremely comfy and everything was very clean. No problems whatsoever with the room. The pool was also very nice and a great place to cool down. The water was refreshingly cool. The walk-up bar was nice and the lounging areas were also very nice with plenty of chairs available. The atmosphere at the Luxor is very upbeat. The crowd was a bit younger than other hotels we visited. That side of the strip was much more lively then even the center strip area. It is just a fun place to be! The food court is nice and a good alternative to some of the pricier spots to eat in Vegas. McDs is is open 24 hrs a day! WE walked from The Luxor to the center strip several times without any difficulty. We also used the monorail from Mandalay to Excalibur that stops in The Luxor a few times. The Deuce is a great way to get around too especially if you want to head to Freemont or Circus Circus. I highly recommend this hotel and would definitely stay again!	
Aug 19 2009 	Centrally located with fantastic swimming pool and restaurants	only thing we didn't like was the pushy hotel staff who were trying to sell timeshare based permanent stalls around the hotel........inviting you in with the promise of reduced show tickets....and then hitting you with.....we will take you by bus.....it wont take long.....I thought this was terrible. Other than that the hotel was great, clean rooms etc.	
Aug 18 2009 	Different cheap but out classed by the others	We stayed at the Luxor for three nights in mid-August. We chose the hotel as it was cheap and seemed to be something different and first impressions were that it certainly was! From the diagonally travelling lifts to the dizzying view from the 18th floor landing - right-across the hotel to the other side - the whole pyramid is hollow with the rooms round the outside! Quite an engineering feat. The room we had was furnished with two queen-sized beds which were appallingly uncomfortable, my wife and I had to sleep with a leg out of the side of the bed or thrust into the middle to prevent ourselves sliding into the hole in the middle. For this reason only I would really mark the hotel down. Of course you could argue that you don't go to Vegas to go to bed, but sleep is needed after walking up and down the strip and through the hotels. The hotel itself did seem darker than a lot of the others - I know they don't like windows in the casinos, but this just seemed a bit oppressive. The pools were fine but only two out of the three were open - in August! Also they were only 3-3.5 feet deep, which made them boring. I wish I had the lifeguards job. Friday afternoon was Pool Party time, which seemed to constitute playing very loud music (not to my taste) and having tattoo competitions for drinks - this may put some people off. Next time it will have to be the Venetian or Bellagio and sod the expense.	
Aug 17 2009 	Chris Angel show is the WORST THING I have ever watched!!	My husband and I attended the Chris Angel show in Vegas this past week. We purchased our tickets a few months ago and I had actually read the many reviews on this show. I read how horrible the show was but could not believe that the show could be this bad. We decided to give it a chance and set our expectations very low. Well, it was WORSE than we could have ever believed that it could be. Chris starts this show with a FAKE Jerry Springer type speech where he picks somone out of the audience and claims that he new her name, state and a word in her head before she even got there. So fake! Then he &quot;dies&quot; and for the next hour we watched giant rabbits hop around a stage. There is a bit of interprative dance and it is over. I am praying that he is not getting paid any amount of money for this show. He is in it for 20 mintues tops. There is no magic, plot, acting, entertainment, etc. Please, don't waste your money on watching giant rabbits hop around a stage!! This is 2 hours that I will never get back. If you already have tickets, cut your losses and skip the show.	
Aug 17 2009 	1st Vegas Visit Great 1st Impression.	Now, Im writing this review three years after the fact, but since we just returned from another spectacular visit to Sin City (Staying at a different hotel this time), I felt I should. I've seen a bunch of negative reviews of the Luxor, so unless things have changed in the last three years, I tend to disagree with the negative reviews of this hotel. When we first arrived, we had no idea where to go as we were dropped off nowhere near the lobby, not the hotels fault, which was the taxi drivers error. When we entered the Luxor, there are help desks and people in uniform more than willing to give you directions, and maybe try to convince you to attend a time share presentation. (On a side note, the time share presentation we went too was entertaining to say the least. It took only four hours out of our day, and we left with a free three night stay in Vegas @ any of the MGM owned hotels and a $100.00 gambling credit. Basically, well worth the time we spent listening to the salesman, looking at the actual Condo, and eating our free buffet style lunch) Now back to the Hotel review. When we finally came to the check in area, it was busy, but we didn't have to wait long. The room we had booked online was a Pyramid Deluxe, but we ended up with a Deluxe Tower room, which was considered an upgrade as it's a bigger room, and allot more quit than the Pyramid itself. Our room was very clean, and the beds very comfortable, and if youre wondering about price, we paid only $49.00 per night during the week and only $99.00 for both Friday and Saturday.(Ive looked at the pricing this year, and theres deals like that all the time, so as far as price is concerned, the price was right!) The staff we interacted with were always pleasant and professional and that includes the housekeeping staff. The food court right in the centre of the Pyramid was perfect for a cheap quick meal, as they had McDonalds, Quiznos, Little Caesars, and a handful of others. On the Casino level youll find the Pyramid Café. Everything here tastes great and the staff are excellent. (We even stopped by this August again and enjoyed our meal and overall dining experience just as much as three years prior) The Pyramid Café has everything from soup and sandwiches, Pizza, Burgers, Steak etc. The Casino at the time, was just like every other casino on the strip except the only difference three years ago to today, is three years ago, there were $5.00 dollar Blackjack tables, where as this year, we couldnt find a single one. Something else thats nice about the Luxor, its connected directly to Mandalay Bay and Excalibur. From Excalibur you can go directly over the strip via the walking overpass and get to New York New York, and From there via another overpass, straight to the MGM, where youll find a Tram that will take you further north up the strip. We had a very positive experience overall, and have recommended this hotel to our friends and would do so again. The only reason we didnt stay at the Luxor this year, was to experience something different than what we already have, so in closing, we give the Luxor an A+, and for the price of the rooms, you cant lose.	
Aug 16 2009 	Avoid like plague	This place was a nightmare. The service was attrocious. I came for a university field trip and arrived the night before the professor did. We had confirmation numbers but were not admitted until he arrived. Whislt waiting in this very SMOKY hotel, I was harassed by a gang who tore my bag. Security did nothing. There internet costs 10 dollars for a short period of time and all of the staff were EXTREMELY RUDE and unaccomodating. They would not even allow me to use their phone to get matters sorted out. I took a nap in the chair waiting and the security came and clapped in my face to wake me up. When I was finally admitted into the room I was not impressed. Only stay here if money is a concern or if you have no other option.	
Aug 16 2009 	Bbrilliant	Amazing place to visit. Hotel huge. Rooms average but amenities great. Close to all the action and so much to see	
Aug 16 2009 	Not what we expected	Check in was almost one and half hours . We had to carry all of our own luggage no bell hop. sent us to the towers instead of prymid where our room was. finally we found our room after finding the right elevator. Room was spacious. carpet not cleaned crumbs on the floor toliet didn;t flush right. had bad experience getting tickets for Believe finally we got upgrqaded for the show. Hotel needs to be renovated. next time I will stay in the middle of strip . Tram wasn't working all week..	
Aug 16 2009 	Don't listen to the negative it's fine	Hello to all thinking about staying at the Luxor in Vegas. I want to mention right away that the resort fee is pretty dumb. But, I haven't stayed anywhere that didnt have some sort of fee. That said.....Our room was ready at noon when we checked in. The elevator was a little shaky, but it was NOTHING to be alarmed about. I've read some people mentioning that they were holding on &quot;for dear life&quot;. PLEASE!! Our floor, as i am sure all others, had only one lift, so you had to walk far.The room didn't smell, and the AC worked just fine. The water was replenished each day, and the news paper was there each morning.The Casino floor was nice. The new look is a little more modern and the games all looked brand new. The MORE buffet has an option to pay by meal, or one fee for &quot;all day&quot;. Many people are saying that you HAVE to purchase the &quot;all day&quot; package. That is a straight up lie. AND, the food was good. I would eat there again. Don't deal with parking, just use the valet people. ITS FREE TO EVERYONE!!! I don't know why people would rather complain about how&quot;Parking was so confusing&quot; when you can valet. Just tip the guy a few bucks when you leave.So, if you want to save some money and have a decent place to sleep, stay here. If you want modern design and a very bright room then stay at Venetian or Mandalay Bay.And, if you are one of those people who are use to staying at Bellagio or Venetian and get off on complaining, then yes, stay here.	
Aug 15 2009 	Exceeded all my expectations!	I have to say that the Luxor exceeded all my expectations in terms of service, room, and overall value. We tried the whole &quot;Name Your Own Price&quot; thing on Priceline and was somewhat disappointed when our low bid was accepted by Luxor, just because we were hoping for something on Center Strip. We got upgraded for free when we checked in and our room was a bit darker than we'd like, but clean and pretty cozy. Bathroom was pretty spacious and more well-lighted (thank goodness). The club, LAX, was actually surprisingly &quot;happening&quot; and hotel guests get in with no line and no charge.	
Aug 15 2009 	Cutting costs by cutting corners	We stayed at the Luxor a few years ago, so when we saw this year's price and we were looking for a break in Lost Wages, the Luxor seemed a good bet. It wasn't as good as I remembered, but it had its pros and cons. The hotel is very flexible about check-in, the queues can get long so they try and process early arrivals if they have rooms ready to save time later.Pros: The rooms (in the Pyramid at least) are big but basic. For the most part they are very quiet (see exception below) - the Luxor is built from solid concrete and the sound deadening is amazing. The Egyptian theme is amusing and well thought out. The staff are courteous and helpful, and the rooms are serviced efficiently. We paid $60 per night including the resort fee, so I rate the value as high. There's a good choice of food and coffee in the complex including 3 Starbucks. You are right next door to the Mandalay which has excellent restaurants (see my upcoming review of the House of Blues...)Cons: It's at the South end of the strip and with all the building work going on it's not so convenient. The pool area looks nice but when they say &quot;4 pools, open from 7.00am to10.00pm&quot; they mean &quot;2 pools, open from 9.00am to 6.00pm&quot; due, I guess, to cost cutting. The pool being open only during these hours, the lack of any shade made 104F rather uncomfortable for me, though there were plenty of people frying themselves and drinking alcohol to further induce dehydration. The only shade available required you to pay for access to the sunshade area. Personally, I think this is the height of corporate greed and irresponsibility. The rooms are basic, with no coffee facility or 'fridge. Our first room was directly above the LAX nightclub, which made it feel like we were inside a drum - but the desk manager moved us as soon as we asked and the new room was as quiet as we could wish.Overall: We enjoyed our stay but I think I'm more a Mandalay Bay or Bellagio person these days!	
Aug 15 2009 	Better than expected	Many reviews are negative here, however my stay was excellent. Check in had a long line but moved quickly. We were offered the type of room we requested on the 6th floor or one with 2 queen beds on the 18th floor, which we took. Room was clean and well stocked with towels and toiletries. The hotel is connected to the Mandalay Bay and Excalibur, which then has a walkway to New York New York, so getting around is easy.The only downside was the More Buffet, we went for dinner and the food was not of a very good quality. We ended up walking to either Mandalay Bay or Planet Hollywood for buffet meals after.Timeshare employees are all over, but if you ignore them they go away. Overall excellent stay for a reasonable price.	
Aug 14 2009 	Not Great like a basic hotel	We checked in pretty late as our flight was delayed. We were both taking a break, me from business &amp; my wife from both kids. We wanted to stay at a nice hotel &amp; kick back &amp; enjoy for 3 days. Long line at check in at 2.00 am !!! They upgraded me to a Tower room which was basic. NO Mini bar, No Coffee\Tea Machine. Basic Toileteries. Carpet wornout &amp; unclean to name a few. The Hotel charges RESORT fees of 10.00 USD per day above the room rate for Telephones which you normally don't use ! &amp; for 2 small bottles of water which were half filled when we checked in! When we requested a glass of HOT Water to take some medicines, we were informed by the room service it would cost us 10.00 USD !!!! This when it is a 5 star property &amp; they charge resort fees !!!! We thought we got a very good rate as it was midweek, but we realised that the rate was probably market driven &amp; a compensation for sloppy service &amp; add-ons . We had stayed at Circus Circus some years ago when we had come with the kids. It atleast did not have hidden charges &amp; the service was extremely good.	
Aug 14 2009 	Amazing Holiday	We stayed at the Luxor Hotel, Las Vegas we were a little worried about going to this hotel as we had read some of the reviews, however my husband and I had an amazing holiday. The hotel was beautiful, the rooms were spotless and the staff were very helpful. Yes the hotel is at the end of the stip but bearing in mind this is actually the start of the new stip anyway ! Plus when you go to Vegas 9 times out of 10 you want to see all other hotels and attractions I know we did therefor you walk, taxi or monorail it. A Must see it the Terry Fator show he is just Fab.Plus the dolphins and tigers at the Mirage.Honestly I could go on and on as I have nothing but praise for Las Vegas it truly was a Holiday of a lifetime :-)	
Aug 14 2009 	luxor = ancient egypt theme	im i being silly or is this not based on an ancient egyptian theme,yes,so why the hell are they soo much bad reviews saying its old,the rooms need updating,its not modern enough, and so on,its supposed to be like that thats the theme of the hotel if the rooms was in modern colours and modern art it wouldnt feel the same,think some people need to think before they review on what they are actualy reviewing on,this hotel is breath taking and the egyptian theme is very classy,id much rather stay here than the so much the same other hotels with no themes and just modern art dotted about all over,one of the best on the strip and an icon of the strip to,hope the other daft reviews saying its old and needs updating doesnt put you off this beautifull place.	
Aug 13 2009 	Getting Old	Location on the strip is not that good. To far to one end, I like to be more in the middle. We had a room on the 1st floor, if you get one of these say no thank you right away. The wall paper was comming off the walls and the view was a parking area. As far as the slots they have alot to choose from and the tables always have room for you. There is a nice food court area to get a bite. I liked that cause not everybody eats at the same time. LAX is in this hotel so for going out at night that is nice and a big plus is if you stay there you get in for free. I think alls this hotel needs in a make over, new paint and some updates.	
Aug 13 2009 	Great location mediocre room	I have to preface this review with the fact that I received an offer in the mail for 3 nights free. Therefore, I can't say that there was any motive for them to give me a particularly good room :)First of all, the Luxor is a Vegas icon. The main casino is stunning, and there are some great exhibits there, as well as a cool pool and spa. I was given a room in the East Tower, which is a bit of a walk through some tight and winding corridors. The room was dated and needed some work, but seemed to be clean. The mattresses were older and not very plush, pillows flat, and bedspread old and raveling in places. There was no wireless internet, but it was available for a charge through a wired ethernet connection which was fast. There was no desk in the room, just 2 queen beds, 2 side tables, and a chair. There was no safe, which is unusual for most Vegas rooms. The bathroom was roomy but a bit dated, and there were mineral deposits in the shower, though it was clean...just made it look old. For my purposes, it was fine, but if you are paying, I might try to locate elsewhere in the hotel, or try a different one.	
Aug 12 2009 	Luxor has gone WAY downhill since January!	Terrible stay.Dirty, understaffed (room service trays sat in hallways and by elevators for 2 days); one pool shut down on 105 degree day to save staffing dollars(no need for lifeguards on that pool).Staff did not communicate or honor &quot;packages&quot; benefits--like free VIP passes to Cathouse and LAX..(club staff would not honor Free VIP passes given out by hotel front desk!!) Now on our &quot;no visit-no stay&quot; list for Las Vegas.	
Aug 12 2009 	An Amazing Experience	We stayed at the Luxor for 4 nights at the end of July 2009. After reading some reviews I was feeling a little worried about the hotel but it turned out there was really no need. Check in was very smooth, the que was quite bad over the weekend however. Had a great room, which was easy to get to as they have designated lifts depending on your floor. Very spacious room with a great view over the strip. Not in tip top condition, but was clean and had lots of nice touches to make it comfortable. Hotel has lots of great facilities with a good range of resturants, the all you can eat all day for $30 was well worth the money! A great hotel and would deffinately return.	
Aug 12 2009 	Great time! Loved the Luxor	We made a family trip for our sons 16th birthday and our 27th anniversary - my hubby and myself, our 2 daughters ages 19 &amp; 9 and our son 16.The hotel itself is a must see! And it had everything we needed - the kids were happy with McDonalds &amp; Cesars pizza and I had my Starbucks. We had a Pyramid Spa Suite and it was more than comfortable and our maid service was wonderful.The check in was quick and easy we got to the hotel around 10pm and we didn't have a wait - the front desk service was also very polite and informative.It was a bit of a walk but we did it and saw all the sights - we walked as far as Treasure Island and when we went to the Stratosphere we just took the Duce - was wonderfulThe room was actually kinda cool and we had to turn the air down on many nights so not sure about the complaints on the temp.Would definately go again - for what we paid for the suite it was wonderful and the hotel was Great!! There is also a gas station/store right across the street so we were able to get some beer &amp; pop &amp; munchies for the room.We also went to the Chris Angel show and were very impressed by the costumes and the theme of the show was really different - everyone was glad they went.	
Aug 11 2009 	Ehhhhhhh	The Luxor itself is very nice. We were upgraded from the Pyramid to the West Tower. The rooms were very clean and nice. However, be forewarned, check-in is a nightmare. The line is unbeliveably long. Because of LAX there were alot of drunk college kids enjoying their first beer. The douchebag &quot;I'm so cool, because I'm 21 and have a fake ID&quot; factor is very high.Also, foot traffic from the not so nice Excalibur can be questionable as well, i.e., they have criminal records and had to call their parole officer to get permission to go.The location is okay. You have to walk a long way to get anywhere. Be prepared to wear comfortable shoes. Also, if you have to go on the walkways and its raining, it is slick. VERY slick.	
Aug 10 2009 	No luxury but ok for the money...	No luxury, but ok for the money...Clean, but old rooms. Buffet is ok, but the same every day. Mandalay Buffet is way better.Pool is old and small, but clean. Location is good: South Strip.	
Aug 9 2009 	Incredible building	I think probably my judgement on this hotel is coloured by the fact I got a very good deal through Expedia, which made it a very affordable stay.For me, the main attraction of it was staying in such a fascinating, incredible building*. The scale of it is mind-boggling, particularly the interior space that you are confronted with when you leave your room.The hotel itself is starting to show its age a little bit - nothing bad, but just slightly shabby round the edges, if you know what I mean. But it's still a decent hotel - again I'm saying this from the point of view of having paid about £40/night for a two-bed room, which I think is superb value.The casino in the hotel we found a bit disappointing and characterless - we much preferred e.g. Planet Holywood's casino floor.The outdoor pool area seemed nice, although with a daytime temperature of 45 celsius it was too hot to just sit around out there!*Obviously we were staying in the pyramid building, not the tower.	
Aug 8 2009 	The Luxor is wonderful.	When staying at a hotel, resortetc, I always read the reviews and add my comments based on my experience. I also like to critique others comments since I feel I am a Middle of the Road kind of guy and can go with the flow as long as I am getting value. Let me start by saying that the Luxor is probably the Best Buy for the money I have ever had. I have traveled throughout the US, Central America and Europe and have paid far more money for FAR less. We are a family of five. My wife and I have been married for 15 years and we have a 14 year old daughter, and two sons who are 12 and 10. We arrived in LV via Allegiant from Colorado Springs. Word of warning.DO NOT book the shuttles, they are slow, for the money I suggest a limo. You pay slightly more but you dont wait and if that is not your style then a taxi is more than adequate. Remember you are only a few minutes off of the Strip from the airport. Check-in was long but I like to people watch and so the time didnt seem to be that long. My best guess would be inside of 40 minutes. Once at the Check-in counter you have decisions to make because that is when you are assigned your room and not prior. We were offered adjoining rooms, one room with a king (for Mom and Dad) and the other with two queens. We took the West Tower and not the upgrade for $35.00 more a night for a suite. We felt that we would spend little time in the room and felt the West Tower would suit our needs. The kids were slightly disappointed since they wanted to stay in the pyramid. That disappointment was short lived after arriving in our room. Our rooms faced the Strip and Excalibur. I wouldnt stay here if you want a real good view of the Strip since you are at the end you dont get to see much. Room quality surpassed my expectations since there were a lot of reviews stating that the rooms were old and dirty. I experienced the exact opposite. The rooms were dark but I found them to be very clean. The only major problem I did have with our room (11210) was that at midnight each night the alarm clock in 11211 went off and I had to call the operator to have security turn it off. This happened three out of four nights. The beds were very comfortable and I did keep the AC on high but it wasnt as loud as most people say. In fact, it was not even noticeable. I have to say that I did like the bathroom a lot! Having a separate shower was great. The tubs are deep so you can really soak and the water pressure and temperature never disappointed me. I have heard many people complain about the added fee for bottled water, fitness center access and newspaper. If you didnt know about them then you didnt read up on the resort. I found that their web site explained it very well and I was also informed on the Allegiant web site about the fees. The pool is very nice and we never had any issues finding a place to set up camp. We were, however, there Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. I would assume that the crowds would be worse on the weekend. We spent our time in two of the pools; one was 3 feet deep and the other 3.5 deep. There was a good mix of kids and adults. The staff seemed to go with the flow. You would occasionally hear them whistle when the horse play got out of hand but they were still cool about it. There were a few times that I wanted a beer and couldnt find the cocktail waitress but not too big of a deal. We ate at three of the restaurants in the Luxor. More Buffet was a waste of money. I found plenty to like but the rest of my clan was less than impressed. We basically spent $120.00 for some sushi and shrimp. I found that it was a better value to eat where I wanted and watch what we spent. The café was great for breakfast. The food was good, hot and fast. My wife and I also ate at the Cat House. The hostess was more than accommodating and offered us a two for one drink special if we ate. We were not that hungry and she offered it on ANY food at the bar. $14.00 for two Red Bull/Sky vodkas was ok by me. My wife had the French onion soup (incredible) and we shared the calamari which was also excellent. Aside from the food the bartender was awesome and they have this living art window where this lady puts on make up and changes lingerie. Very seductive! I found this to be very HOT as did my wife. It made for a nice evening. I played blackjack for most of my stay and found that the dealers and pit boss to be very good. I didnt play any machines but did like watching the craps table (I have to learn someday). Check out was done via the TV. It was very easy since all we had were the added fees and a couple of movies. In summary, dont take all you read to heart. I find that many people feel that they deserve more than everyone else and when reality bites they try and bite back via reviews. And remember if you want to be treated like a guest at the Bellagio then stay at the Bellagio. The Luxor exceeded my expectations and my family had a very enjoyable time even on a budget. Sincerely	
Aug 8 2009 	Stuck in the Elevator	I booked this hotel because it was affordable and conveniently located on the strip. It was a couple of my girlfriend's first time going to Vegas so I thought Luxor would be an awesome place to stay. We stayed there for 2 nights and I'm glad that was all. First, to walk from the self parking to the check-in lobby was gruesome. The line was long and we had alot of luggage to carry. We stayed on the 18th floor and the room was extremely far from the elevator. We decided to lounge at the poolside and the security lady kept grilling us about what rooms we were staying in and what our names were. That was a pain in the butt and to top it all off, we got on the elevator and were stuck for about half an hour. Thankfully there was a call box and someone to keep us company while trying to find someone to open the doors for us. My friends were getting dizzy and we all sat on the floor. Once someone came to get us, the hotel &quot;accommodated&quot; us with only 2 buffets tickets. There were 4 people, but they said they could only give 2 buffets out. Needless to say, I am NEVER EVER staying at that place again!	
Aug 7 2009 	Beware free tickets with room ticket scam	We booked with Mandalay Bay - two rooms - four free show tickets. When we went to pick up our Criss Angel tickets (orchestra/ aisle seats) the box office gal &quot;Alma&quot; said we had 'missed our show' but she could give us 'nosebleed' seats in the top corner of the theater. I asked to see a manager, for whom we waited over 20 minutes, with two reminders to Alma (who finally called the manager the second time we asked!). When I told the manager I had confirmation numbers, she logged in and told us our tickets were fine for that evening, good seats and all. She was obviously NOT SURPRISED that Alma had made this so - called 'mistake'. Hello, folks, they are selling your good tickets to those who will pay more and giving you 'free' ticket holders crappy seats as if they are doing you a favor. This is a major scam, and you must keep your confirmation numbers. We will NEVER return to Vegas. Also, Luxor reeks of smoke, worst casino of all.	
Aug 7 2009 	It's okay	After staying at the Monte Carlo the last couple of trips we got a promo for 3 free nights at the Luxor and it coincided with our anniversary so we thought we would give it a try again. We have not been here in probably 5+ years. There have been some good changes and some not so good ones. There is nothing really that horrid about this hotel and I am not sure what the others are were expecting as the glory faded from this place a year or so after it opened like anything else in LAS. It is a people warehouse and that is all you should be expecting. You want new...stay elsewhere, you want anything more than passable service... stay elsewhere. You want a place to crash with a casino....it is just fine. If you are not going to gamble then you will be better off at a Hampton Inn as you will at least have free internet and breaky. The check in and check out queues are horrible and the worst thing about the place. They are very short staffed so plan accordingly. Drop someone off to get in line and then go park the car. They will still be in line when you do get from the car park to the lobby. Do the video check out on the TV or the express check out envelopes.The room has the same furn and decor that was there years ago with the exception on the armoir's. The furn is nicked and scratched. The bed spread was snagged. We called for more pillows that never came but when we called again they eventually did show up. Bed was comfortable. Scratchy towels and not many of them. They do charge this silly fee for newspaper (who reads USA Today anyway at least give me the RJ) and some tiny bottles of water that you can get for free while playing in the casino. All items in the room worked. The internet is a $15 fee and broadband cord is behind the TV and mine had a short leash so I had to work on the bed. No wireless in my section of the East tower. We ate all our meals at the Pyramid cafe or Backstage deli. All were good. The Pyramid used to be open 24 hours but they have been tinkering with the hours due to the slow down. All our meals ended up being comped so always charge everything to your room. The slot club is now where the Keno used to be. Always sign up for the slot club when you arrive to stay at any casino hotel and go back to the slot club an hour or so before you check out to see if you have earned any comps. You can not bank comps like you used to with the old Oneclub. They are trip to trip so use them up! When you check in make sure all players are registered to the room or you will not be able to easily redeem the comps. There are at least 3 Starbucks now and they are all busy. The food court is large with a good selection. The pools looked great but we never got to use them and it was too hot anyway. After Sunday one of them was closed.We enjoyed our stay and if we get another freebie we will come back.	
Aug 7 2009 	Nightmare at Luxor (Police acamady rejects)	45 Minutes to Check in (after eleven hour flight not a good start)Room dirty had to pay for an upgradeTime Share touts everywhere within the hotelPool Towels DirtySingles Parties Every WeekendWe had booked to stay at the Luxor for 14 nights from the 22/07/09.On Friday the noise from the pool was unbearable we could even here it in the roomSaturday pm music by pool even worse, asked 5 staff members to turn it down.Spoke to events manger my partner put his hand on his shoulder to talk into his ear due to the loud noise it was the only way to make him understand what he was saying. Did anybody else see this we need as many witness as possible, we are taking the mater further, can you help ?It then became like police academy the security guards and their manager started to read us our rights and tell us to get off the property. We tried to reason with them but they just got worse. Marched to reception like criminals and tried to explain the situation to manager by showing him the way in which we had approached the situation. With this one of the security guards started to shout at my partner Hands in the Air Against the wall Spread um. Obviously this poor boy had been watching to many police programs. With that we were both then lead into a room and told to shut up and not speak, The situation became worse when I stood up and asked to leave to get some air, yes again it was time for the security guard to take his fantasy further, he screamed in my face Sit Down Sit Down and pointed what appeared to be a stun gun at me, at this I really did start to panic and my partner asked for a medic to calm me down, enter three fire officers complete with resuscitation equipment heart monitors etc they concluded the obvious my blood pressure was high and wanted to take me to hospital. At this stage there where two security guards two managers and three fire men in the room along with two police officers. To cut a long story short we were escorted up to our room given 10 minutes to pack and escorted off the property.DID ANYONE SEE THIS OR COMPLAIN ABOUT THE NOISE AROUND THE POOL DURING YOUR STAY WE NEED SOME HELP !!!!!!Would never stay at the Luxor again even if it was freeWe are not young teenagers we are in our early 50s we still love to party. Maybe someone should film an episode of shameless at this hotel it would be very entertaining.	
Aug 7 2009 	What's the Problem?	After reading some of the other reviews - i was a bit concerned with line-ups etc but we check-in at about 5pm, with about 50 people ahead of us and we were through in 10 minutes. The check in was very fast (the only down side was the agent at the desk - who was probably the least friendliest person we experienced on the trip). We were on the second floor in the Pyramid - no view but again we were not looking to stare out our window while in Vegas. The room was large and clean - there was no tub just a shower (which all hotels should do) - and i have no idea what someone would have an issue with. There was the $10 resort fee - for the 2 bottles of small water and paper. We did not receive our water one day and i figured if i am paying the $10 for it - i would like to have. I called housekeeping and received the water within 10 minutes + received a $5 credit on our bill. Hey we'll take it!We had the champagne buffet one day  it was okay  but Im not a big buffet fan. Overall, I also liked this casino  it wasnt too large but enough tables/slots to get your fill. They had live music in the Casino on the Friday night (July 24)  which was great. The valet service is super quick and was it was a good thing to have a car - we were at the bottom of the strip and it was easy to grab the car and go out for some economical meals. I would recommend this hotel and stay here again.	
Aug 6 2009 	It was quite nice and great summer deal!	I have read some of the negative reviews and can say we didn't experience the same issues. we were travelling independently and not on a charter package so maybe we avoided some of the lines etc because of it.We stayed in the tower and the room was nice (our rate was insanely cheap... YAY recession). The room was large, clean and well decorated.There is the free shuttle train that takes you to Excalibur and Mandalay Bay which is nice. Then you can take the monorail if you want to avoid walking a lot. I would suggest the monorail because you do a LOT of walking in Vegas anyways.Compared with our later stay in the Monte Carlo, we found this far superior a hotel.	
Aug 6 2009 	The best honeymoon ever! Would definately stay here again...	I have always loved Eygptian themes and fancied going to Eygpt for our honeymoon but then I wanted to go somewhere with the added excitement, so we chose to bring Eygpt to Las Vegas and booked for 11 days at the Luxor.First impressions were good of the outside and the lobby until we saw the check-in queue. It was ridiculous... we waited for over an hour and a half to get to a desk. There were loads of desks free but only 2 people working at them! After being awake for many hours and a long flight, we did not appreciate such a long wait and this seems to be the norm. However, the Luxor soon redeemed themselves by upgrading us to a suite for FREE as we were on our honeymoon and the staff were really friendly. They also gave us offers at the buffet (which meant we ate for free), free starbucks coffees and a cheap round of drinks so we couldn't complain. Soon we were away to the West Tower... the room was fabulous... lounge area, dining area, jet bath etc etc.The maids came in daily, however I will say they never came around the same time of the day - it was either 9am or 4pm, or any time in between - lucky for us we were up and out early everyday but there were a couple of days we missed them as we were having afternoon naps (it was so hot at 117 degrees).The hotel staff always seemed polite and the buffet at &quot;More&quot; was fabulous too - although a couple of the staff there were a bit miserable and snappy - but don't worry - we didn't tip them. Customery yes, but it is based on service and a smile! I would definately recommend the food at the buffet as it was good value for money, but it was cheaper elsewhere so don't be afraid to venture out. We ate frequently at the Excaliber (hotel next door, best steak and Italian meal ever!)The pool area was lovely and relaxing although not always as clean as I'd like (cigarette butts, empty bottles etc), but on the whole impressive and they provided towels! Again the staff were friendly but I would recommend taking your own water to the pool area as $7.50 a bottle is steep (especially when you can pay a couple of dollars from the shop down the road).I would definately recommend the Luxor and I would also go back, but out of all of the hotels we visited, the Luxor was the worst for trying to sell you show tickets etc. They were by every entrance, door way, escalater etc. We did expect a little of this, but on the way from the lobby to our room, we would be approached by at least 4 people (at this was at least twice a day)... so be prepared... if you are not interested, just interrupt them and say &quot;No thank you&quot; otherwise you are engaged in conversation and held up for ages.Again, I say the food was good, staff were friendly, room was lovely, hotel was clean so I have to say positively that it would be a place I'd visit again.	
Aug 6 2009 	Wont be back...	Rooms were below average quality, and not very clean; The front desk staff (check in and out) were not friendly AT ALL!!! Saying 'hello' was difficult enough to get out of them as was &quot;how was your stay&quot;; The Players club staff was a joke. I was told I could only use club card on slots and at Luxor only, even though it's a 'Mirage' owned property; Players club employee even told me to bring any recipets for meals or ammenities purchased at the Luxor, BACK to the players club desk to redeem points. This is not the case as I found out when I did. I was told by a 'too bad' attitude staff member that the 'other staff member' shouldn't have told you that and there's nothing she could do about it as these purchases needed to be 'charged to my room'. She wouldn't even call the manager to help as her response was, &quot;and what is he going to be able to do if I can't help you&quot;. I was even privey to one of the hotel cashiers discussing her 'weekend' activities and using profanity in her explanation of the events to another cashier. The staff was just horrible. The gaming minimuns NEVER went below $15 and alot of the table games were closed. Very limited gaming activity so I went elsewhere. The hotel had one of the pools closed and blocked off. This created a small area that had to hold alot of people. There were not enough chairs for all to use and some actually used the small grass areas to sit at, while some others just left. Luxor sucks and it's too bad that others will find that out by staying there for themselves.	
Aug 6 2009 	Great fun -do it	Mid week deal for £33 - great value. Does not include $12 resort fee, but we had a room with a view of the strip slightly obscured by the Sphinx's behind! Great pool area. $15 for Wi-Fi connection so gave that amiss. Long hike from car park to reception - they advertise complimentary valet parking which might be worth a try.	
Aug 5 2009 	It's Okay	We went on a guys' trip to Vegas from July 31 to August 4. We stayed the first two nights at the Luxor, then moved over to Mandalay Bay for the next two nights (see my review on that, if interested) I have stayed in the Luxor in the past, and this time, it was pretty much exactly as I expected it would be, which was a decent, middle-of-the road Vegas resort. We were able to check-in early, and were given a room on the second floor of the pyramid. We would have much preferred to be a little higher, so we could actually see the atrium, but oh well. Also wasn't too thrilled about their $10+ daily &quot;resort fee&quot; which gave us two tiny bottles of water, a daily newspaper that we never read, and use of the workout facilities. So, basically, we paid $10 for a couple of bottles of water. We used the pool both days we were there, and it had a fun, party vibe over the weekend, with very few kids running around, which was great. (couldn't say the same about Mandalay Bay) What wasn't great was the resort being short about 50-100 pool chairs, with plenty of room for those chairs to be spread out in the pool complex. I would encourage them to stop being cheap and go buy some more chairs for your guests. As others have stated, the rooms are definitely starting to show their age in the pyramid, and are nothing to write home about as well, but they were clean, the beds were good and the showers were hot, so I can't complain too much for what we paid during the weekend. Didn't eat a lot at the resort, but had breakfast in their food court a couple of times, and it was nice having a low-key affordable area where people could eat. If you are wanting a luxurious place, I wouldn't stay here, (or Mandalay Bay for that matter) but if you are looking for a reliable, decent place to sleep and hang out by the pool for a few days, this is a good option.	
Aug 5 2009 	Luxor is Getting a Bad Rap here	The passionate negative reviews posted here would scare almost anyone into booking a room at Circus Circus before the Luxor. Not a fair impression at all.  I stayed here last..in...well it was before the towers were even built, so what? 15-20 years ago? It was new and unique and special then. I had a quick business trip to Vegas a week ago, and decided to have my wife fly over and join me for a couple of days on the weekend. We booked a Pyramid SPA suite. There indeed was the typical line at check in..probably 50 people deep, but it took me literally 10 minutes until I was at the front and being checked in. the clerk was friendly and my room was ready. A very nice experience really. The room was on the 13th floor and had a &quot;strip view&quot;, which is now really only a view down to the portion of the strip that is directly in front of the property because of the towers and the Excalibur next door blocking any view to the North. It was clean and COOL (a stark contrast to the 110 degree temp outside), which was most welcome. Sure, the place could use a face lift, as is mentioned regularly in these reviews, but it is not the dump that some say it is. It had everything that one really needs, particularly for the price. Everything else...the casino (I'm not a gambler), the restaurants, pool...were pretty average by current Las Vegas strip standards, which is what I had expected. The entire town is so over the top, that you have to have the proper expectations going in. The Luxor is not the Ritz. It's in a class with the Excalibur, Flamingo, Harrah's and Bally's. If you want more, book the Bellagio, Venetian, MGM or Cesars, Wynn, Mirage, etc. We enjoyed our stay and had a fine time. That said, we have decided that the next trip to Las Vegas, we're going to put some distance between ourselves and the insanity and try the Green Valley Resort.The real problem is with all of the run amok 20-somethings who absolutely lose control of themselves in that town. It's like they leave half of their IQ at the airport when they land. Get past the foolishness, and you can still have a fine time as an adult in Vegas.	
Aug 5 2009 	Loved Loved Loved	I loved this hotel. The check in line was a little long, but the upgraded room made up for the wait. My only problem with the hotel it was very very cold. However, once you step outside in the nevada heat you will appreciate the chill in the casino. The west tower room was beautiful, I had a view of the pool which was jumping with people but it added to the vegas excitement. I loved the food at the pyramid restaurants. The serving size were large, the waitresses was excellent and the price was reasonable. I would stay at the luxor on my next trip.	
Aug 4 2009 	Rubbish Hotel	My husband and I stayed here for five nights with our 12 year old son mid July. We were really disappointed in how this hotel has been left to deteriorate over the past five years. My husband and I stayed here in 2005 and it was apparent that little investment has been made in this hotel since this time. We stayed in the main pyramid building and the rooms were basic and shabby. The hotel corridors are dismal and dreary and the carpets are filthy. The hotel is no longer geared towards families, as it was 5 years ago, and indeed even their steakhouse signature restaurant does not offer childrens menu's or half portions. The swimming pool is an absoulute rip off with no sun parosols or shade from the sun being available free of charge!!! We had to pay $120 dollars per day to have the pleasure of a private cabana to enable that we had some shade from the sun. Dont stay at this hotel. There are plenty of reasonably priced hotels in Vegas which are far superior to this. We will not return!	
Aug 4 2009 	Worst customer service on the strip!	Me &amp; my partner have stayed in this hotel twice because we generally like the layout &amp; pool at the Luxor plus the rooms are nice in the tower areas. This was the last time. The customer service is their biggest downfall. After having to wait 40 minutes to check in for the second time on our trip could be forgiveable if the staff were not so rude. Our room keys would not work so had to go all the way back to reception where a staff member called Jesse refused to even listen to us &amp; kept telling us in an agressive manner to go &amp; que up again like everyone else (another 30 mins!) he then proceeded to chat to another member of staff whilst everybody waited patiently. This was one of many examples which made my blood boil as Im usually a passive person who never complains. I understand Im not going to get a high level of customer service with hundreds checking in but I dont expect to be treated with such disrespect even in the casino area where staff seam to dislike the average touristWe finally had enough &amp; moved to New York New York for our last nights stay, 2 mins to check in &amp; friendly staff.	
Aug 3 2009 	Time to upgrade	I have stayed at the Luxor many times in the past and it has always been a great experience. However my last visit in January was probably my last until they renovate or have some huge promotion. The restaurants are not good, the rooms are beginning to appear run down and parking staff a bit rude and shady. The check in staff were very polite and apologetic considering it took them a while to get me set up. When we got to our room it still wasn't ready, had to wait for the maid to finish (she was nice). They run promos with free entrance to their clubs/bars and meal vouchers but #1 girls always get in free at any of the clubs and #2 again... the restaurants are not worth going to. Overall cleanliness and comfort of the rooms are okay but i'd fork out the extra cash for a better hotel hat's for sure! ... Oh yeah DO NOT ORDER ROOM SERVICE! ordered a couple of burgers after a night out and was charged $100 which included child size bottled waters! The burgers were DRY and not worth the money. If I wasn't in such a giggly mood I would and should have complained and demanded a refund instead of laughing about it.	
Aug 3 2009 	Average but a treat for the price	The Piramid is old and the inside walls don't look as clean as you'd like but the rooms are big, breakfast is great and the shows excelent too. Don't choose this if you don't want to walk or if you're in a hurry. The shuttle to the Excalibur works fine and pretty fast if you're with no hurry.	
Aug 3 2009 	Would stay here again	My husband and I stayed for a week at the Luxor in July. This was our first trip to Vegas and we absolutely loved it!The hotel is nice and in a good location. It isnt in the middle of the strip, but it is attached to both the Mandalay Bay and the Excalibur hotels through internal areas. This means you get the best of three hotels quite easily and can avoid the heat (112F in the shade!).The check in queues at the main desk can easily be avoided. There is a separate check in at the West Tower, where there was no queue at all. They have an express checkout where you simply pop an envelope containing your room keys into one of the many post boxes around the place.The room didnt have a safe, but when we asked at the main desk we were escorted to the security deposit box area. This is a free service and is very secure. You can access it 24 hours a day quite easily.We did miss a kettle in the room, but it seems that Vegas hotels dont provide these. There are a couple of Starbucks and a food hall on site (with a 24hr McDonalds) where you can get a cup of tea.The rooms were a reasonable size and very clean. The maid arrived daily.The casino had a very good atmosphere, much better than many of the others we popped into but did not stay long in, as we preferred the Luxor.We did not visit either of the two nightclubs in the hotel, but the queues were long enough to indicate they are both popular with locals and visitors alike.The food at the Pyramid café was good and reasonably priced. The all you can eat buffet had a good choice (unless youre a vegetarian  but then we found that Vegas does not accommodate veggies anywhere!).The pool is shallow so you cant really swim in it. However all hotel pools seemed to be like that in Vegas.A couple of tipsJoin the MGM Mirage Players Club. Its free and you get points for playing slots and table games. The points can be transferred into either free play, or meal vouchers or show tickets etc. You also earn comp money for playing, which you can spend. These are all valid at any of the several hotels involved in this club.We didnt know about the comp money until the day before we left. We could have spent it in the aquarium at Mandalay Bay or the Secret Garden at Mirage, but we had already been. We ended up spending it on food, beer and exhibition tickets. If we hadnt paid for the hotel within a package, we could have knocked the money off the bill.You get free drinks whilst gambling (although you should tip the waitresses). They all have an area that they cover and some are quicker at serving than others. If youre not in the path of a waitress you wont get free beer and it is expensive at the bar. We moved to a slot machine in the path of a drinks lady, got a drink and then moved to wherever we wanted.All slots have different variations on plays. If you play a $1 machine you get one win line for that. Some have 5 win lines, so it would cost $5 per spin. You can also change the amount you bet per spin on each machine (a $1 machine will allow you to spend $1, $2 or $5 per spin). Be careful not to press the Max Bet button or it will automatically take out the maximum (which could be $5 x 5). We actually found a 1c machine that cost $4.80 for a max bet!All in all we loved the Luxor and would happily stay there again.	
Aug 3 2009 	Not worthe the price	I keep hearing about decent hotel for the price paid, but we apparently didnt know where to find these great cheap room prices. We booked a package that included two day beds by the pool. We were told prior to our arrival only one bed was available, but we could check back after 11am to see if there were any no-shows. Needless to say we got to the pool very early as this was upsetting our trip. By 11 am we were still the only people at the pool. They reluctantly gave us a second chair.But being the only people poolside we must have received amazing service, right? Nope! Waitress was surly and definitely did not want to be there that day.The line for check in was ridiculously long as most other reviewers have also commented on. The overall organization at the resort was poor.If I had paid $40 a night like some people, then this would have been a decent hotel, but for the price we paid, no way	
Aug 2 2009 	Avoid the Luxor at all costs!	I have stayed at the Luxor a few times and the last visit was MY LAST! Initially it has been a great value with the Travelzoo rates. Previously I obtained a $70. rate with dinner and free cocktails. This trip was $42.00 with no extra perks which if things had gone well, would have been an excelent value but from start to finish, it was a bust.To begin with the wait in line to check in was over 45 minutes. Evidently the recession has caused this property to let go over 1/2 of their staff to get the hundreds of visitors checked in effeciently.Before arriving I stopped at Whole Foods and purchased a nice bottle of wine to get the week started. Once in the room, I noticed that not only were there no wine glasses as is the custom in most &quot;resorts&quot; but no wine opener or fridge either. I called downstairs to ask for an opener and was told that they &quot;had no access to any wine openers&quot; but I could purchase one at the gift shop for $12.00. I said that was unacceptable and what were the other alternatives. I was told to take it to one of the bar tenders down stairs and they would open it. Once at the bar I was told that there would be a $25.00 fee to open the bottle. I let them know that not only was that unreasonable, but that I would not be purchasing any drinks or doing any gambling in the property while I was there as this type of response to a simple request was ridiculous.The next day the temperature was 113 degrees and both pools at the Luxor were closed due to vomit in one and feces in the other. There was no offer to use a neighboring pool at any nearby property and thus, the pool was not an option for one of the hottest days of the month.That evening after returning from an afternoon of visiting other properties, we opened our door to an unmade room. It was 5:30 p.m and still no maid had cleaned our room. Fortunately we had hung our towels from the morning shower and reused those.The linen s on the bed look like some tired bedspreads from &quot;Motel 8&quot; and the room itself was musty and warm. It seemed like the air conditiioner was never able to really cool down the room.The parking garage is free in all of the hotels and casinos on the strip which is a nice perk when you rent a car as we did, however, the Luxor seemed to be the only garage that NEVER had a parking space in the garage itself. We were always forced to park on top in the blazing sun. My suggestion to the hotel is to reserve the inside spaces for those guests who are actually staying there and let those cars from other hotels park up top in the horrible heat. There was never a problem finding a space in the garage at any other hotel or casino on the strip the entire week. Very odd!At check out (which is 11:00 a.m. by the way.... you can check out later at any Holiday Inn Express or Hampton Inn you know, I was greeted with a daily &quot;resort fee&quot; of $12.00. When I asked what this was for, I was told it was for the bottled water, paper and use of phone for local calls. Since I assumed there would be a charge for the water, I left it alone and did not use the phone. I asked for this fee to be removed and was denied. The fee is new and was not on my bill the last time I stayed at this property.All in all, I was disappointed in the Luxor. Having stayed there before, I knew what type of hotel this was and was not expecting it to measure up to the Venetian or Caesar's, however, things have really gone down hill with customer service. On my way out with my bags, I noticed a room service cart outside a guest's door with an empty bottle of wine and a cheap little plastic wine bottle opener that said LUXOR on it. I guess I was simply being lied to when I was told that neither housekeeping or room service had any access to a wine opener of any kind on my arrival.I would not recommend this hotel to anyone since (next to Mandalay Bay) it is the farthest south on the strip and a very very long walk or cab ride to any of the nicer casinos. It is &quot;tired&quot; and run down and even the cocktail waitresses are older and frumpier. The bars are deserted and Carrot Top is so over. It is time to get a new venue for the place for entertainment and either tear this one down or completely revamp it if the staff is going to be so inept and not at all interested in retaining customers in these difficult times of a recession. I will not only never stay here again, but I wil never even take anyone all the way down to this property to see it. The novelty of Egypt and this old theme is old news.Venture on down to the Venetian or the Bellagio where they are offering some wonderful rates never before seen and you will be so glad you did. You won't have to spend money on cabs or stand in long lines to register either. They still know how to treat their customers even in hard times!	
Aug 2 2009 	About Luxor not Las Vegas	We arrived in Las Vegas after a short internal flight from San Francisco [ see Handlery review ] After collecting our luggage we jumped straight in to a taxi which was well organised and the journey cost approx $25. Luckily when we arrived the queue to check in was not so bad, however during our stay we noticed some very lenghty lines formed at the check in. We were staying at the Luxor for 5 nights and we were given a Pyramid deluxe room on the 5th floor overlooking the pools. The room was large and comfortable with 2 beds and a great bathroom/shower. The only slight negative that we would comment on was a slightly noisy air conditioning unit.To be honest we were not in our room so much due to the great weather and vast amount that Vegas can offer. The Luxor has a good selection of bars, restaurants and casino. At $30 for all day, the More buffet was excellent value with a fabulous choice 2 good size pools are free to guests with your room card and complimentary towels are given out. They are well supervised and clean. Again, the only negative is that there is not a lot of shade for the free beds, however you can pay for the VIP area with upgraded beds and parasols at $30 each or $50 for two. In conclusion we enjoyed our stay which went smoothly without a hitch. The location is good but not in the middle of the strip. We would return to the Luxor if the opportunity arose.	
Aug 1 2009 	Worst hotel EVER!!!	First of all, my partner and I read the reviews of hotels all the time and 9 times out of 10 we find that the bad reviews are not warrented, however, this time I can honestly say it is the worst hotel I have stayed in and that includes hotels in third world countries.My Partner and I stayed for 10 days in this hotel. When we arrvied we were surprised to find that we did not think it was that bad, it was a bit dark however thats to be expected from a prymid hotel, the checkin was really slow around 30+ guests trying to book in with only 3 reception staff, considering this was a daily occurrance i would have expected them to have more staff than that.the rooms were a good size, and were clean, however, the towels were old and somethings stained and just didnt like good, even after complaining we still got the same towels.One day after coming back from a trip at 5pm we found that our room still hadnt been cleaned, we called housekeeping and they told us it will be at least another two hours to be cleaned, my boyfriend then spoke to the assistant manager (as it was the managers day off) and told him to have the room cleaned in the next half hour or move us. After a few harsh words the assistant manager agreed to have it done, which it was.A couple of days later we found the drains blocked in the room and there was all sorts of stuff coming up from the bath plug and the water in the shower would not empty again we reported this and it was fixed within 24hours, however, you dont expect this kind of thing to happen in a country like America, maybe in Egypt where we travel to 3 times a year, however, i have never experienced such problems in their hotels.The customer service at this hotel is appalling, considering it is meant to be America, i expected alot more from the staff, they were rude and slow and I really didnt think that Americans were like that.I would not recommend staying here, it would be value for money if the rooms were clean and the customer serivce was good, because you pay for what you get, however, even with the price I still expected a bit more than what I got.	
Jul 31 2009 	Pleasantly Surprised	We were attending a wedding in Las Vegas and booked the Luxor due to friends planning to stay there. Booked the room in March for a July wedding. Over the time between I received mixed reviews from friends and acquaintances on the Luxor. By the time July rolled around I was getting pretty apprehensive. As it turned out, there was no need. We wanted our group to be on the same floor, so we took a non-smoking room on the 3rd floor. Our room had a limited view of the mountains (looked out the Sphinx side). The room was clean and had a fresh smell (no old smoke odor). The decor was typcial hotel ... with an Egyptian flair. Beds were fairly comfortable and the air conditioner worked fine. Even though the &quot;Pyramid&quot; is cavernous and the hallways are open to it, the room was very quiet. The pool was nice, nothing spectacular, only downside, they don't open the pool up until 9am. (In July it is pretty hot by that time, would have loved to be there at 7am for coffee and breakfast.The spa was great. Had a 1hr treatment, you are given 3 hrs of spa access with a treatment - wish I had known that before I went. We had dinner plans so I only spent 1.5 hrs there. Enjoyed every second of that time!Overall it was a good experience and I'd recommend it for the $60/nite we paid.	
Jul 31 2009 	Well worth the money	I have seen quite a few critical reviews of The Luxor. Honestly I was impressed with the property. First things first. We got to Vegas to have fun day and night. We use our room to sleep for a few hours a night. The hotel itself is clean. I have heard horror stories about the long check-in lines. We arrived right at 3:00p.m. which meant a very long line. There were plenty of people working the front desk, the line moved quickly and the total wait couldn't have been more than 10 minutes. We booked a pyramid room for a great rate ($38). No complaints with the room from our standpoint. I'd assume if the property is being utilized for the room then one would probably be disappointed as the basic pyramid room isn't really setup for leisure time in the room.That being said, we weren't there for leisure time in the room so it worked just fine. Bathroom was clean, maid service was great. Never ordered room service so can't tell you how it is but from the menu it was not cheap. I'd say the restaurant price is cheaper then the room service price and the basic room has a very small table and two chairs so spreading out for a decent dinner in the room wouldn't really be a smart option. You want a good meal go to one of the restaurants. Tender was very nice. Price wise compares to any other decent Steakhouse at other comparable properties on the strip.Covered walkways between Mandalay Bay, Luxor and Excalibur along with an elevated tram make it easy to visit a few casinos without testing the 114 degree heat. Didn't visit the pool either so can't really comment on it although it seemed as if everybody around it was enjoying it.I would recommend this property to those who will use the room for a few hours sleep and a shower. if you want Italian marble, gold fixtures and millionaire treatment then you would probably be disappointed. But if you look for a place to lay your head and can get pyramid room for a decent price (less than $50) I'd say you are getting a great deal and won't be disappointed.If I was forced to give a complaint I would have to say the elevators were a little shappy. The travel at an angle so they seem quite shaky as you ride up. Plus they ones we used seemed a little on the dirty side. But I spent a total of about 15 minutes out of 5 days in the elevator so hardly a reason to stay somewhere else.Surely one of the best values on the strip but many properties have great deals these days. If you want a little swankier spot check in on Mandalay Bay prices. But again, if you are looking for a strip property and a place to lay your head and clean up every day you really can't beat The Luxor for price and location to several other casinos. I would stay again if offered the same room at the same price. No doubt about it.	
Jul 29 2009 	There's no place like the Luxor...	This was our third trip to Vegas and third stay at the Luxor. I have seen super long check in lines, but have managed to avoid them myself. The rooms are spacious, clean and the beds comfortable. I've seen complaints on here about lighting and the elevators shaking. Well, the elevators are GOING UP ON AN ANGLE! It is a pyramid. And how bright do you need it to be in your room? I'm there to sleep! Great service, good food, good games. Going back in October and can't wait!	
Jul 29 2009 	3rd time was not a charm	This was my 3rd time staying at the Luxor since it has been built. I would recommend at this time ONLY staying in the Towers. The Pyramid area rooms really need to be cleaned up and redone. Carpets are dirty and the rooms are a bit run down. I stayed one night in the Pyramid room and felt very uncomfortable because of how dirty it was and also the hallways were very filthy. I called down and paid more to be moved to the Towers which are newer and much nicer. Still nothing fancy but updated and clean. The casino's are clean and well kept, I assume because they need people to come to gamble to make money. I only ate at one restuarant which was very good. It was T&amp;T which is mexican. I was a bit disappointed that LUXOR slowly is losing its theme. I am not sure the hotel knows what it wants to be anymore. Many of the original features that made it what it was has been changed. The little shopping area towards the Excalibur was totally closed up and empty. The second level has been totally changed 1/2 away from the LUXOR theme. The arcade is gone and the IMAX theatre was closed when I was there. I did enjoy a day at the spa which they had really inexpensive spa treatments due to economy I assume.I will NOT be staying at the Luxor again.	
Jul 28 2009 	Great trip	Thanks to The Luxor we had a great trip. the rooms were wonderful .The beds were so comfortable after a long day walking the strip.The pillows were so great I wanted to take them home with me. the buffet was full of anything you could think of to fill you up. The Tender is a great steak house.. We could not have ask for anything more. Everyone was more than friendly and helpful. LOVED IT	
Jul 28 2009 	Clean but needing updating	We had gotten our rooms through Hotwire so got a very good rate. We have stayed here many times and been pleased with the accommodations.This time we received a room in the very back overlooking the air conditioning, we asked for a different room and were told &quot;no&quot;. I am guessing because we got such a good rate through Hotwire they were not going to move us, but they had lots of rooms available. They called the next morning and offered to move us if we wanted to pay much more, makes me think, hmm do I want to stay here again.The hotel is definitely starting to show its age, the room was clean, but in need of updating, the carpet was very ragged looking, the chair was in need of tossing. The rooms still have all the original Egyptian looking furniture. The bathroom was clean. The beds were comfortable. Everything is just old and in need of replacement.	
Jul 28 2009 	You'll walk your feet off and laugh your butt off	My wife and I stayed at the Luxor July 19 through the 21st of this year. Our Pyramid room on the 15th floor was quiet with a capital &quot;Q&quot;. The view was to the east over looking the Sphinx at the front and over to the Airport. If I had had the energy I could have watched the Nevada sunrise every morning but we managed to be way too busy every day to have that much energy that early. It was well appointed and very clean, though there was a set of lip marks on the window, somebody obviously really loved this town. We only managed to eat at two of the restaurants in the Luxor, the Buffet &quot;More&quot; was well stocked with pretty much everything you could want and at a very reasonable price. The only disappointing eating experience in Las Vegas was when we had a lunch at the coffee shop ( I forget the name ) The service was luke warm and the food was not so great, but no biggie, there are a zillion places to eat on the strip.We are not gamblers, though we tried our best to lose the $20 each that we had and came away well ahead of that (beginners luck?) The casino floor was like any of the others on the strip, same sound, same lighting, same servers, same layout. I know it sounds like we were non-plussed, don't get me wrong we had fun playing the slots just that it wasn't set apart in any way. There were two display venues, The Titanic and Bodies. We had seen Bodies before in Vancouver so we went only to Titanic... it was very interesting and well presented giving you an in depth view of what the ship and and it's WHOLE story were. One cool thing they do is give you a passenger character card upon entering the exhibit, it kind of connects you to the story. We saw many of the sights that Las Vegas' Strip offers both free ones ands paid and if you have never been I have to say GO, at least once. Spectacular looking hotels, great shows, luxurious stores, delicious food and of course everywhere you go the opportunity to lose a little cash. But nowhere did we feel ill served or cheated in any way.Primary Advice - Comfortable Shoes.

Jul 28 2009 	The clue is in the room rate!	We travelled to Vegas for the last 4 nights of a west coast holiday and chose the Luxor because of our 11 year old daughters fascination with ancient Egypt. While I couldn't say my wife and I were impressed with the hotel it was just about what we expected given the relatively low room rate and the reviews we had read prior to booking up. We had a pyramid room which we thought was ok, decent size, nice roomy bathroom and (flying in the face of other peoples views) comfy beds. I am a light sleeper and do not appreciate other peoples noise, no complaints on this score during our stay, I suspect this may have been more to do with the 'white noise' emanating from the air conditioning but so what. Once outside the room however I was a little surprised by the general grubiness of the hotel. The corridors looked as if they were hoovered rarely if at all, numerous trays with decaying food were evident along the 3 mile corridor we had to traverse to get to the elevators and all the external doors of the rooms looked like they had been salvaged from council flats. I don't think it would take much for the hotel management to sort this kind of thing out. Having said all of this we thought the breakfast buffet was excellent value and also enjoyed the pool area. We have discharged our promise to take my daughter to the Luxor and we will not be returning. Even at 11 it was clear that she saw the chasm in quality between the Luxor and hotels like the Bellagio and the Mirage. However all in all we got what we paid for and I was reasonably satisfied with the experience.	
Jul 28 2009 	Can do it in one word: Brilliant	Having been to Vegas a few times, I've always ended up stayinh in cheaper places - Circus Circus, Stardust (what was!) Stratosphere and even Time share reosrts off strip. Now as a regualr visitor to Vegas I can safely say that if you spend a lot of time in your room your sad anyway. However it is nice to go back to somewhere comfortable. I found the Luxor to be perfect. Its middle scale, not your cheap accomodation and obviosuly not Bellagio standards. The staff were friendly and helpful the rooms large and clean. I stayed in the Pyramid itself, we were offered the tower as those rooms were newer and apparantly better. Personally I think if your going to stop in the Luxor you want to stop in the Pyramid and enjoy the lift! Open your door and step out and the buzz and excitement that Vegas offers hits you head on.	
Jul 26 2009 	Not bad but not great either	I have been to Vegas a few times, but this was my first time staying at the Luxor. I usually stay at the &quot;nicer&quot; hotels, like Mandalay Bay, but I was traveling with 3 friends and we just wanted to get away for cheap, and save our money for the tables or other fun stuff. We arrived from the East on a late flight, so when we arrived at about 11pm, there was no line for check-in. I told the woman at the desk that it was my friends' first time in Vegas, so if we could get a room with a view, that'd be great. She said she'd &quot;upgrade&quot; us to a tower room, but the view basically sucked. To this day I can't figure out what it was we were looking at from the fifth floor. So, no big upgrade there, but I suppose not having the slanted window made the room slightly larger.The room itself was standard. Plenty of room for the 4 of us, two queen beds and a little sitting area. Tub and separate shower. Toilet with enough suction to drag you in if you happened to flush while still sitting! ha! BUT, the beds were horrendous. HORRIBLE. One night my limbs kept falling asleep from the pressure spots from the crappy spring mattress. May explain why I did so little sleeping during my trip.The pool was nice. Very hot with little place for shade. I did, however, spring for a cabana rental (200 per day) for two days. It was well worth it. We enjoyed our private area, with a TV, table for four, four loungers, rafts, etc. There was even a cooling mist that we controlled over the loungers. That was definitely sweet. But you couldn't really float in the pool with the rafts because it was so crowded. Lots of kids. Not my typical vegas experience, but I did enjoy it.We didn't eat inside the hotel besides the McDonald's so no comment there. I did grab breakfast at the starbucks-- don't be dumb and pay $4.50 for a water bottle there. Just pay 60 cents for a large cup of ice water and take it to the pool. The casino was great-- at least to me! Great time at the blackjack tables, good dealers, decent drinks, and the slots seemed loose to me. At the &quot;liquidity&quot; bar one night, we watched a man and his &quot;escort&quot; making out and groping each other EXCESSIVELY on one of the couches. While we drank and took pictures of them, a security guy came over and booted them out. Highly entertaining, and also nice to know they arent encouraging people to do their &quot;business&quot; publicly.Overall, I would recommend the hotel if you're primarily motivated by the thrill of the bargain (it was practically free for us to stay there). However, if you want luxury, don't go here. And if you have the slightest bit of trouble sleeping, DONT stay here, the beds will make you miserable.	
Jul 26 2009 	Awesome Hotel great price!	I'm 21 years old, and i went to Las Vegas with a friend of mine who is also 21. It was going to be an 8 day party fest. I had been to Las Vegas before when I was 11 years old, but this time I could truly experience the Vegas nightllife.POSITIVES: Thought the Luxor was very clean and tidy, the rooms were brilliant, and we got them at a great price, it was very spacious, and the beds were comfortable. The main casino area of the hotel was excellent, all the floors were clean and tidy, with no cigarette ends or chewing gum pieces mashed in. The mini food court was cool, situated on the upper floor in the main atrium, great little area to chill, especially with a hangover!!NEGATIVES: Obviously we were partying all night and sleeping during the day, which was slightly unfortunate as the music being played from the swimming pool area was quite loud, and you can actually hear it through the tripple glazing windows! The Luxor is one of the most southern hotels on the strip with Mandalay bay slightly further South, which wasnt the best as everywhere we went in Vegas we had to walk all the way back and it felt quite away from the main action of the strip. (however the monorail proved to be useful in this sense). A problem which we found with EVERY hotel on the strip was NO FREE internet access! u always had to pay.OVERALL: This is a great hotel, looks stunning from the outside, always seen in the movies, cheap prices for the rooms, clean and tidy. What more could you ask for? ...Except to win more on BlackJack!	
Jul 26 2009 	Horrible Hotel - I HATE LUXOR	I think Luxor is egyptian for line. We got there at around 7PM and the line to check in looked to be about 45 minutes long. We left and went to a concert. Upon return we were greeted with the same long line but with less employees working the front desk. It took 45 minutes to check-in. We paid extra for a &quot;tower&quot; room. The room was small and the walls were so thin we could hear the conversation in the adjoining room word for word. I whole experience was very disappointing. I was expecting a 4 star hotel and instead found myself waiting in line like a chump. DO NOT STAY AT THE LUXOR	
Jul 25 2009 	Luxor=great value and awesomeness!	The only thing even remotely negative about this hotel is that it is on the south end of the strip which means it could take you 1+ hours to get to the Bellagio/MGM Grand area. But honestly, the hotel and casino have so much to offer and it's pretty quick getting to Excalibur (which is connected) and New York New York. The pools are awesome. I felt like I was at MTV Spring Break, but I don't know, it was my first Vegas experience, so maybe that is what it is like everywhere.We stayed in the pyramid and the view was awesome, the room was great, the shower was HUGE!!! They give you free water and a bag of popchips along with gobs of coupons like buy one get one beer at Tequila downstairs and tons of other stuff. I don't know about anyone else, but I am used to staying in hotels that tempt you with a bottle of water in the room that costs $6, so the free water was amazing! And trust me, you are going to need it in Vegas!	
Jul 25 2009 	Luxor still a Classic!	The Luxor is still rocking. Long lines have always greated me late in the afternoon so all you can do is be patient. My pyramid room was not available or the only one available was on an extremely low floor. You stay in the pyramid so you can look down a long way - it's part of ther ambience. I did not want a room on the 2nd floor; so I was given a room in the tower for the same price. Tower rooms are supposed to be nicer and bigger - I did'nt see it. So what I had a shower and separate tub...I don't need no stickin' tub. The room was okay but I really missed staying in the pyramid and riding the &quot;inclinator&quot; as opposed to the elevator. The Luxor seems to be trying to get away from it's original theme of Egypt/Luxor. There used to be women in Cleopatra outfits and men in Pharoh outfits walking around and would pose for pictures- there was none of that. As well they are now calling their inclinators - &quot;elevators&quot;. You see the building is a pyramid; built at an angle - so the mode of transportation goes up and own at an angle and not straight up and down. Again, this is all part of the uniqueness and mystic of the Luxor.I booked my room in January; the room rate was $82/night. Since I am on the Luxor's e-mail list, two months later I became aware of reduced room rates - half price. Nobody from Luxor contacted me in regard to the new bargains or getting a reduction in the original room rate- I'm lucky that I found it and was able to take advantage of the reduced rates. I called the Luxor and told them that I would like the new rate and they obliged me. As a teacher I will tell you that you have to be smart; shop around and keep checking rates to see if they have gone down.Anyway the Luxor has not shown it's age and is still a real treat. I fully recommend staying there especially if you get a good rate. Rock on Luxor!	
Jul 25 2009 	Not Worth It..Go to Fremont Street instead!!!	The Luxor is located on the south side of the strip. Upon check in the line was quite long but moved fast. Upon getting to the room, I found the room very average. The bed was TERRIBLE!!! I have never slept so bad in my life. When I checked in the front clerk did not tell me about the resort fee. I guess they thought they had my credit card on file so I would eventually find out. The resort fee was $12.66 a day. I called and asked what this was for and they told me that the 2 small bottles of water, a USA Today newspaper and access to the fitness club was what the fee was for. A rip off in my eyes. I checked out early and went to the famous Fremont street. There the rooms are cheaper and the all around cost is way cheaper than the strip. The food is better on Fremont street also. I will never stay on the strip again!! Especially the Luxor.	
Jul 25 2009 	Enjoyed our stay kids had fun	My family enjoyed their stay at this hotel. The check in line was long but the staff had it under control. My kids loved it; they felt special being in the hotel shaped as a pyramid. They enjoyed the pool and the facilities. The room itself needs to be updated. My husband and I did not sleep well in the beds. Not sure why they do not use fitted sheets on the mattresses. My kids loved how spacious the room was. We stayed for 3 days but if I had to return to the hotel I will only stay 1 or 2 nights.	
Jul 25 2009 	Great value hotel highly recomend it	First impressions of the hotel was good and it didnt dissapoint,food was good especialy the buffet!,staff were friendly and helpful,its a good base to start to explore the strip	
Jul 25 2009 	Not all that impressed	We were here for my son's wedding at the Mandalay Bay Hotel. I chose this hotel for the price and it was easy access to the Mandalay Bay (there is a inside walkway). We stayed in the pyramid. Rooms were small and clean, but the hotel really needs an update. Carpets were saggy and bumpy. elevators were dirty and hallways needed to be repaired..	
Jul 25 2009 	Disappointed	We chose this hotel because my daughter loves Eygpt and wanted to stay in a pyramid. Looking through brochures there was no suggestion that this hotel would be any less elegant or scrumptious than others on The Strip. It was only AFTER we had booked that I thought to look at the reviews on Trip Advisor and of course my heart then sank. As our visit to Vegas was only the first part of a three-location trip to Ameica we decided to be positive and make the most of it, which is what we did. The Luxor was a disappointment, but we had prepared ourselves for this so that helped. Our check-in was in fact very quick, but with a miserable and unfriendly check-in woman. The first room my husband and I were given had an unmade bed, dirty handbasin and rubbish left on the table. I called reception to request a change of room and was told we would have to pay for a porter if we wanted the new room key brought up to us. The pyramid rooms are dark because of the slanted windows; the corridors are dirty. I saw evidence of vaccuming only once during our five days at the hotel. In the corridor we passed a used coffee tray several days before it was removed and - this is true - on one day I walked past a used panty liner twice before it was removed (although to be fair I imagine this fell from the trolley of the cleaner and she hadn't noticed). We chose to relax, snack and eat in other hotels on The Strip so that we only had to sleep at The Luxor. The one exception was the Pyramid Cafe where we had breakfast each day - this was very good value. My daughter and I shared a plate each morning as the servings are enormous. The beds were comfortable and the sheets were clean. The rooms were spacious, but the overall atmosphere in the hotel is tacky rather than the elegance to be found in other hotels on The Strip. I would never go back to this hotel.
