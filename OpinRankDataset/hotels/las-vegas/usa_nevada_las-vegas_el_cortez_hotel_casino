	What a change - easily the best value downtown	We have been staying downtown 2-3 times per year over the last 6 years, and 6 years ago never thought the El Cortez would even be a consideration to stay in. It was a dump, dirty and delapidated, in a somewhat scary part of downtown, 2 blocks east of the Fremont Street Experience. The clientele seemed to fit the place perfectly. Smoke poured out the casino door when it opened (we smoke and we noticed the haze inside) and a foul odor hung in the air.Over the years, I would drop in there for a moment just out of curiousity. I noticed that, unlike some other downtown properties which were falling into decay, the El Cortez was spiffing up.Earlier this year, I convinced the better half to come in with me. She had vowed 6 yrs earlier never again. We ended up spending about 3 hours there, and she was shocked at the turnaround (but still skeptical).We got an offer to stay in the new Cabana Suites and (after agreeing with her that we would go elsewhere if it wasn't decent there, as well as researching their remodel, etc. on the web and showing such to her) we booked, opting for a Tower room as the Suites are non-smoking. I'm glad we did, as the Cabana Suites are also across the street, not attached to the main building.The changes are not superficial.Services were excellent all around. When we booked they gave us a room number. We arrived about an hour before check-in time and the room was ready (same room number they had given us a month earlier). Not once did we see a smudge print on the elevator panel, nor anywhere in it (although it is a pet peeve of mine, that nearly every property that has a nice big furnishing in the hall when you exit the elevator has been knicked but good by the maids vacuum and isn't touched up. Same here) . The room was large, clean (no fear of being barefoot as in some other properties) and well appointed. No flat screen TV, but it was big enough. Except for the TV, it looked just like the picture on their website (believe me, many of the other properties rooms do not). Bathroom is kinda small, but that wasn't a problem. Electronic safe is in there mounted near the floor in the closet area. You won't find amenities already in place in the room, but they're available, just call down. She needed a hairdryer and they offered to bring a frig as well. Don't see that happen often. No old noisy heat/cool unit on the floor by the window here. Output and air intake are vented from the ceiling with the control on the wall near the door. And no old 'popcorn' ceiling.Gambling was fun, great mix of new and old machines (there are still coin payouts on some, old Vegas) and the limits are low on the tables ($3 BJ with 3/2 and 25 cent roulette with $1 minimum) which is nice if you hit a cold streak. Casino was very clean at all times in the 3+ days we stayed. It was common to see not just maintenance people picking up around the place, but floor people, servers, and security as well. Machines were being wiped down and no trash and empty cups/bottles laying round them. The air was clear and no odors. Carpet and floors all clean. Fellow patrons were friendly, it has a loyal following.We ate each day at the Cafe Cortez. Great food and a lot of it for cheap (frig came in handy for leftovers). And yes, Jackie is around, he ate at the next table Sunday morning. Didn't try The Flame or the hot dog cart, but heard they were good. If you don't want to stop gambling to eat, they have a service to deliver food to you. We forgot to try that, but saw many people using it.There are still some characters in there, but that's typical downtown. Security is abundant, inside and out. Not once did we see any disturbance. The short walk to the Experience is plenty safe, day or night. We walked one night to Binion's to eat at the coffee shop there (sure glad we did, as unfortunately it will be gone in a couple of weeks) and had no problem at all. But the fact is, we enjoyed the El Cortez so much, that was the only time we left the property.Bottom line, the El Cortez ranks #2 as far as downtown properties go (Golden Nugget is #1, but much more expensive). If your looking for a hip crowd and expensive duds, go to the GN. But if your like us, average working class people, the EC is the place to go.	
	It's ok but we are not returning	We got a room in the tower. The room was clean (enough) and very roomy with a sitting room. However, I didn't like the bathroom - kinda old and the tub was sloping. The sink is outside of the bathroom and is also slanty with little counter space and it's too low. The worst thing is ventilation in the hotel - you just can't stay away from the smoke, even in a non-smoking room. Air in the casino is quite bad, even in the restaurants. They do have a section of coin-operated slot machines which I think are for the old-timers who preferred the substance and sounds of coins. Tried both restaurants in the hotel and both were alright with decent prices. Our friend got his room from Expedia at $42/night, 3-night stay special. His room is situated on top of the parking structure on the 5th floor (I think they convert it), kinda weird but has newer furnishings and decor than our room. It's suitable for those who look for good prices. Finally, I must mentioned that El Cortez has 2 parking structures, one attached, one detached. They also have a separate building (El Cortez Cabana Suites) across the street. Excellent location for those who want the Fremont Street Experience. Everthing was ok with our stay, but we usually look for more comfort and excitement so we probably won't return.	
	El Cortez	Totally awesome host and the staff was totally excellent... Nice rooms and good slot play...New ventilation has nearly totally moved the old smokey casino problem... This is Old Vegas at its best!!!	
Nov 23 2009 	will not go back again!!!!!!!!!!!	I booked this hotel online. the pics look good online, but not the same when i arrived, i can smelled the ciggarate all the time when i was sleeping, and i can hear the other door slam in my room. the room was very small. i will not go back again. i will rather pay more money to stay in a better hotel. not recomment.	
Nov 13 2009 	A pleasant surprise	I had read many reviews about the Tez and its renovated rooms, but I was not totally convinced - however, as I was travelling alone, the price was right and I only needed a place to crash after gambling the farm away and drinking myself to oblivion I figured that I would give the El Cortez a try.My 2 queen beds tower room was totally renovated and a lot better than the rooms I've had recently at Imperial Palace, Boulder Station, Texas Station and Fiesta Rancho - not to mention dives like Plaza, Vegas Club and Terribles. The only negative point was the old television set - but who goes to Las Vegas to watch television?The food options are quite limited: an &quot;upscale&quot; steakhouse, a coffee shop and a sub shop, but at par with what you would encounter in any downtown casino. The gambling is great - good VP, loose slots and THE BEST single deck blackjack in town (stil paying 3:2). They have upgraded the rooms and the casino - now they need to upgrade their patronage, and I am afraid it will take a while until the people that used to favor the property when it was the third worst hotel-casino in town (after the Western and the Gold Spike) go looking for greener pastures.If you are looking for good odds instead of volcanos, pirate battles and water shows and if a swiming pool is not high on your priorities list, I am sure you will love the El Cortez.	
Nov 12 2009 	great for the price	I am a frequent visitor to Vegas and have always stayed on the Strip, this was my first time staying in the Freemont area. I thought I would try it for the nostalgia aspect. This is one of the true old Vegas hotels with lots of history. The hotel itself was clean, beds were good and AC worked. Security was in the parking lots to protect your cars. If you are in Vegas to gamble or sight see the El is a great place to stay. This is not one of the new hotels on the Strip so do not expect the same amenities. If that is the experience you are seeking then spend the additional funds and stay on the Strip. The staff at the El are friendly, helpful and quick to react to requests. The Freemont nightlife is well worth seeing and experiencing. For an inexpensive place to stay in Vegas I would highly recommend the El Cortez..	
Oct 29 2009 	If you like mechanical surprises stay here.	Yes the price is reasonable. The remodelling is OK. However if you are unlucky and the front desk staff put you in a room with mechanical problems, it can be very unnerving not to mention spooky, wierd or disgusting. This a very, very old building. Obvious and unseen maintenance concerns are ignored. If you like to gamble on your hotel also, STAY HERE AT THE EL CORTEZ.	
Oct 23 2009 	We Liked the El Co!	Just returned from a two night stay at the El Cortez on a comp I received in the mail.We had a Queen Double in the Tower - Room 614 at the end of a hall. The room was huge! It was nicely appointed and very clean. The bathroom is very small, so if you need a big bathroom, don't stay here. It was quite adequate for the 3 of us tho.We ate a Cafe Cortez for breakfast twice and dinner once. We thought the food was very good, with a very good selection. Service was a bit slow at times, but everyone that worked there was very helpful and friendly.The casino is quite big and spread out. They have the usual table games, with Black Jack at $5 a hand. They have loads of new penny machines and video poker machines in all denominations. Their dollar and quarter slots are very, very old and there is almost NO selection in the quarter range. They really need to get these updated! Many of the older machines were very, very dirty. Maybe there are plans to get new machines and this might be why there is no upkeep on them, I'm not sure? I basically just played video poker, but really would have liked to play some quarter slots.All in all, we had an excellent time! I certainly would stay there again and look forward to doing so on my next trip.	
Oct 13 2009 	A great stay!!!!	My husband and I stayed at the El Cortez in the Cabana Suites. The Cabana Suites are actually across the street from the casino but it's literally 40 steps to get from one to the other. Both have security posted outside at all times so I always felt safe even if I was coming or going without my hubby with me. We got a suite on the ground floor, and called to see if we could have a suite on an upper level...( I dont like being on the ground level). They gave us a free upgrade to a bigger room on the 5th floor and the rooms are newly remodeled, quiet and VERY comfortable. The staff was friendly and helpful and the casino is nice and everything is clean and comfortable. We ate breakfast at the cafe and it was decent food...not great, but not bad either. We stayed three nights, which we booked on hotels.com for $117.00! What a deal...we also got a free coupon from the hotel when we arrived for a free 2 night stay before December 28. Needless to say, we already booked our trip back. We will be bringing out two teens this time and requested rooms in the tower rooms section, which several people we gambled with and met said were really nice too, and they have two queens. The Cabana suites only have king beds. This is well worth the money and great value! It's also just a block from the Freemont street experience and all the downtown casinos and entertainment. I would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to go to Vegas on a budget and really get a nice place to stay!!! Thanks El Cortez....we'll see you in December!!!	
Oct 10 2009 	El Cortez Las Vegas	hotel is located 15 minute drive from The Strip. Rooms are okay for this price	
Oct 10 2009 	Will return!	Made the decision to stay here based on user pics and reviews from Trip Advisor, and we were happy we went. So, yeah... it's not the Palms, but we felt very welcomed by the staff, and you gotta stay 'classic Vegas' at least once in your life. Very friendly security staff, front desk, you name it. Also, we had a very honest housekeeper. My husband had lost his ring, and we didn't notice until we had left the hotel for the day. When we returned that evening, the ring (that she found in the pile of towels on the floor) was placed on the counter for us to find.  The tiny window in the shower that leads to the outside is just like the ones at the Gold Coast. Very strange, yet amusing at the same time! Classic. The cafe had great food at a great price and we ended up eating there twice while we were there for three days. Also enjoyed the fact that the walk from the garage to our room was much closer than the hike you gotta take when you're staying on the strip.  Overall, I would return to this hotel for sure!	
Oct 9 2009 	not bad at all!	i was really happy with this place , nice clean rooms had a tower room,it was a lt of wood , good place to gamble the table games cheap! cafe is reasonable and pretty god food,.if your expecting luxory this i'snt your place but it is very comfy and clean and for us simple folks its right uptown!	
Oct 8 2009 	A great place to stay for the price.	We received an automatic upgrade to a nicer room upon our arrival at the hotel. The room was spacious, comfortable and clean. The staff were excellent and treated us as old friends. The Cafe has excellent food at a bargain price and the service was very good. We will definitely stay there again. (we go to Vegas 2-3 times a year and look for deals. The El Cortez is one of those deals we search for!)	
Oct 8 2009 	$10 dollars a night nothing to complain	Beside the location (far from the strips) and service (waited 3 hours for my room), everything is good. The room is huge and clean. Parking is free. Their casino is kind of crappy but i am not gambling anyway. For $10 dollar a night, it worth everything penny.	
Oct 8 2009 	Another great time at the El C	My wife and I have stayed at the El Cortez many times over the last few years. This was our 3rd trip there this year. We had a tower room. Rooms are large, King bed. Standard TV, Desk 2 chairs and a love seat. Rooms are clean and housekeeping does a good job. We did not eat at Flame this time but we have in the past and is always good. We ate a few breakfasts at Café Cortez. They are good nothing special. The El C has good rules on BJ and slow limits. Craps has 10x odds. A good amount of full pay VP. When playing VP at the bar you can still get imports and micros. Check in can be a bit slow at times. Valet are always great.	
Sep 10 2009 	jail without the amenities: the cabana suites	This 'boutique' hotel is run by security guards...this was the most horrific hotel stay in my hundreds and hundreds of stays (obviously elsewhere). The hotel is run by security guards who will NOT let you in at 3 in the morning into the lobby mind you - when your key doesn't work for front door. If there is anything you need you have to deal with the front desk at the El Cortez main hotel...+ if you are checked in and need anything - like a working room key - there is no separate area for guest services - they make you stand in the regular check in line that can be very very long with one or 2 surley gals max at counter to help. The room: no drawers - apparently this is high style - have to live out of suitcase. no towel racks. no door on closet so you look at the ironing board et al always...reminiscent of motel 6. There is no one to help you. The maids are mean. room keys never work. Have to walk through + cross a really funky street and you are 'greeted' by a security guard outside and if lucky to get in a security guard inside...and these are rent-a- cops so no consistency like they would know you. Even when they do know you won't let you in building if key doesn't work. And lucky if the one elevator works.Oh and new policy - no blankets. They now add 2nd sheet for your warmth and comfort - hard to believe.No food. No anything but misery. Horrible. Worse than horrible. Oh and did I mention that I was escorted out by 3 security guards when checking out because my key didn't work after I popped down for a smoke while packing? What a story. And about smoking -- the only area designated is in the alley next to hotel without even a place to sit...except on an electrical box.	
Sep 10 2009 	El Cortez is overall best deal in Vegas	I stayed at the El Cortez in Downtown Las Vegas Sept 2-8 and was very pleased. I booked a non-smoking, king in the tower. I was in room 801.Likes:1. Forget Limos and Taxis. Catch the city bus at the airport. It will take you right past the rear of El Cortez on Ogden Road. Just bring your luggage right on to the bus. It's OK. Bus fare is $1.75 or $4 for 24 hour pass). What a deal and so convenient.2. The nightly room rate averaged mid-forties per night (including the 12% tourist tax).3. Clean/Big room. The A/C cooled just right and was easy to adjust.4. Two spacious and comfortable chairs, small couch, desk, large coffee table, great view of the strip gazing south.5. Free in-room safe (4 digit code type) spacious enough to store your laptop, Ipod, cell phone, cash and credit card.6. Plenty of electrical outlets for recharging and tech needs.7. Good fun book with $5 off food, $5 match play blackjack, free cocktail, Dollar 10 spot keno for 50c. May as well use the freebie coupons.8. Friendly front desk and maids. Please tip your maid!9. Good TV with several channels. Quality picture and sound.10. Good security, had to use my pass key to activate the elevator and open my room door.11. Internet access on main floor to print your return SW Air boarding pass (25c per minute, $1 minimum, 50c to print pass.12. Free El Cortez courtesy shuttle will return you to airport at end of your stay.Dislikes:1. I wish the mattress were a bit firmer, but still quite adequate.2. Shower head sprayed, but not with gusto of my home shower.El Cortez will be my new haunt. Again, very pleased.	
Aug 22 2009 	Great room for the price.	I was searching for an inexpensive hotel to check-in to as we reached Vegas quite late at night. The El Cortez was a great intermediary hotel. The rooms were clean and the staff was nice enough.	
Aug 18 2009 	Convenient and reasonable for old downtown Las Vegas	We stayed here in March 2009. The price was reasonable and the location was convenient to get to Freemont Street. The downtown area has cleaned up significantly over the past few years. I did not feel unsafe at this hotel or walking from here to Freemont Street.The room itself was dated but large and clean. The bathroom was tiny but functional. The bed was comfortable. The room was quiet (we couldn't hear road noise or noise from any neighbouring rooms).The general service at the hotel was fair (not great, not bad). The casino itself okay, as far as the older casinos go. The tables were cheap. Despite the idea/myth/rumour that the slots are supposed to be looser than on the strip, I did not encounter this. Service in the main restaurant was very slow and breakfast was not particularly cheap nor tasty.There is no shuttle from the airport to the hotel. We did take the bus from the airport which was not very expensive and did not take much longer than a cab ride would have.	
Aug 4 2009 	Great room for the price though they could do more for the environment	Friendly and helpful staff. Room is clean and comfortable. I repeatedly stay at this hotel. In fact, I am going there again this week. Review of environmental aspects: They use the small bottles that use a lot of packaging instead of bulk dispensers for their bathroom amenities (shower, shampoo, soap). Their towel service is by request: if the towel is thrown on the floor, they change the towel, otherwise they don't change it. They used compact fluorescent light bulbs (CFLs).Environmental rating: 2 out of 5	
Aug 1 2009 	Pleasent hotel to stay at service great and rooms clean.	We usually stay on the strip, but with the current economic climate we decided to cut corners, one of which was for us to stay downtown. It actually made a nice change to stay off the strip and buses run every 10 mins up to the strip. The hotel is quite rundown but is clean and the staff are great. I was particularly impressed by the free shuttle service to the airport which consisted of 4 guests at a time traveling in a luxurious car with a very friendly driver. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel to any one looking to stay off the strip.	
Jul 28 2009 	this hotel works for us	My wife and I visit las vegas 4 or 5 times a year. We stay both on the strip and downtown. Normally we stay at the Golden nugget or the Four queens when downtown. After reading reviews about the cortez we decided to give it a try. We were very happy there. The tower rooms are clean, nicely furnished and plenty of room. The bathrooms are small but manageable. The hotel staff are very professional.  The gambling is pretty good. My wife plays video poker, and both trips she came away a winner unlike the strip slots. I played a long time on my gambling budget. This reminds me of the good old days in vegas. The food is pretty good at reasonable prices. Try the fajita or prime rib at the cafe. The flame steakhouse serves a great lobster and the Chicago salad is pretty good. Did not like the steak. ( check out cheapovegas.com ) The cortez is 2 blocks from The fremont street experience. This is a good thing, because after a night of street music, casino and bar hopping you can leave all the noise and people behind you when returning to the cortez.	
Jul 27 2009 	not as bad as I thought it was going to be	Pretty good, cheep price. Things were clean and I can't say I have any real complaints per-say. I went, just to say I spent the night here. This was Mob owned back in the late 1940's.Saw the Rat Pack is Back show down the street, drove around town, ate, lost 40 buck in under 2 mins. on the strip. Good times.	
Jul 19 2009 	best value for money hotel for non sun worshippers in downtown	I travelled to vegas to play poker and after being unable to stay in the Golden Nugget I decided to split my accommodation budget and stay half the week in the cheapest I could find and half in one of the best. I used trip advisor and despite the mixed reviews decided on El Cortez and Bellagio. I was really impressed with the Cortez, the room was the same size as the Bellagio and had new bedding massive comfy bed and was all newly decorated throughout. Talking to a few other people I believe it used to be a bit grotty and if you take thebrooms with the access from the car park it still is. They are spending loads of money on the place though and apart from the bathroom the room standard was comparable to that of the Bellagio where I spent the second half of my week the addition of a new lift only makes things easier. Friendly staff clean room, sheets and towels, what more do you need? I did not spend much time in the casino as I think it is a bit of a locals place with some of the best value slots in the area (not my thing) the only down side is that there is no pool or sun terrace but they are in the process if building a new block addition and I believe this will have an outdoor area for hotel visitors use. Once this is finished I have no doubt that it will move up to poss a 3 star rating much better standard than the current value places on it. I paid less than 30 dollars per night for a massive room and the cafe is one of the best I visited (including my time on the strip) I only ate in Bellagio once as the ques are just riddiculous, around 60 to 100 people in line for the buffet all the time I stayed there. I really enjoyed my time there and would stay again, if you are not bothered about the prestige and are happy to visit places and use your hotel as a home base then this is the one for you not a family hotel but great for any adults single or otherwise	
Jul 13 2009 	Not so good	We stayed at 3 different hotels during our Las Vegas stay and El Cortez ranked the worst of the three. The ladies at the front desk were nice. Our a/c didn't work and the maintainance man was rude. We got moved to another room which did not have a view of the strip. The furnishings in the rooms are nice. We went to the restaurant and were treated so rudely that we left. I work at a casino and I expect a certain level of service. The El Cortez did not meet my standards	
Jul 8 2009 	One of the Best Bargains Las Vegas Has to Offer	Husband promised me that if I agreed to stay here and not the Palazzo or Wynn, we could rent a car. Soo, I decided to grin and bear it and stayed in a Vintage room. That is a room where you have to walk up stairs to get to it. Nice old furniture and the room is clean enough. My only complaint would be that it does not have a hair dryer. For the money though, you can't go wrong. The maid service was excellent and appeared very grateful to have received any kind of a tip. It obviously appears that the majority of them are not given any tip. How Sad! The hotel also has a martini special 2 for 1 from 5 to 7 every evening and they make great martini's.	
Jul 1 2009 	Perfectly fine	We booked a room for 4 people - had 2 huge queen beds. Quite clean, a casino just downstairs. Pretty nice buffet. We didn't expect much and it was fine - who is staying in the hotel room in Vegas??	
Jun 30 2009 	Vintage Room Better Than Expected	I booked a vintage room which is above the casino. Stairway access only for these rooms. The vintage room was nicely furnished and very clean. The ventilation system produced hum and vibration but did not disturb me but can see how others could be bothered.  The El Cortez is a very short walk to Fremont St. Experience which I made several times. The property had plenty of free parking and the internet connection was fair. The casino seems to do well. Security was on the ball and housekeeping was considerate. Overall, my vintage room was very comfortable, bargain priced and a good launch pad for a fews nights stay.	
Jun 26 2009 	Solo only!	I really like this hotel because I am a solo traveler that loves Vegas! I am female by the way but if had a man , I would perfer more luxury. You know, couples spend more time IN the room but for me, when I wake, I hit the ground running and enjoy the STREET! I gamble, eat , and see the sights. At night I crash and the hotel is fine. You can also get a late night meal before bed. They have a few new slots that make it worth your while to gamble there. If you want fun, on a budget, and can deal with basic only,the EC is the place for you. If you're trying to impress with your lodging, stay elsewhere. For my money, EC anytime! I was there in March, May, and will return in August 2009. I am from S.C. but I return often because, I love Vegas! (I really hate there is no fridge or micro wave in EC)But my best tip for you is, take the bus or cab-because after all the alcohol all the many casinos offer you-they will lock you up for DUI in a heart beat in a car. It happened to a friend and spoiled the whole trip. Real bummer! VIVA LAS VEGAS!	
Jun 18 2009 	Updates to El Cortez make it even better.	The El Cortez has made changes and updates that should make anyone staying in the downtown area consider it as their first choice.As always the relaxed atmosphere, friendly staff, great bargains on rooms and meals make a visit to the El Cortez worth it. The drinks keep coming.I didn't recognize the place at first, but all the changes were well thought out.	
Jun 8 2009 	Clean and nicely decorated	We had stayed downtown before but this was the first time at El Cortez. We thought the room was very nice, beautifully furnished and clean and the bed was comfortable. I was disappointed that there was no mini-fridge or hair dryer in the room, and they were stingy with the towels. The downside was the casino - way too smoky too spend any time in, and the comps were poor compared to other downtown hotels - for the same time at the tables at El Cortez we received $4 compared with 2 free meals at the Queens. The coffee shop is very dark, but the breakfast was great. Staff is friendly. Also, we had an even-numbered room - a guest with an odd-number told us he had trouble sleeping from the noise from the concert on Fremont.	
May 25 2009 	Cabana Suites	I just returned from my weekend stay at the Cabana Suites in Las Vegas. The Suites are very much a part of the El Cortez Casino. You must check in at the EC front desk, park at the EC valet or self park, and when you call the hotel operator from your room it is the EC operator.When we walked into our standard room (the cheapest priced room they have) my wife and I were shocked as to how small the room was! We didn't even bother to unpack. We immediately called the front desk and asked about upgrading into a bigger room. We upgraded into a Junior Suite for $30 more a night.Negatives:The rooms size was just fine. However, I was disappointed the room didn't have a sitting area. In my experience, any room with the word Suite in the description, usually means it has a seating area (love seat, chairs, coffee table, etc.).The beds were very unimpressive. Not firm at all, but lumpy. The pillows were soft, but very overstuffed. If you're picky about pillows, you should probably bring your own. The room had no dressers to put away my clothes. The place were you can hang your clothes did not have a door.The lighting was horrible. Very small lamps in the room. The bathroom was very nice, but lacked counter space. This was surprising because there is so much empty space in the bathroom.The room had a very attractive selection of snacks (even an intimacy kit). However they were priced very high if you decided to open them or eat them. Example: M&amp;M's were $5! Intimacy kit $6. The positives:The lobby area, hallways, and exterior of the building were very clean and nice. It looks exactly like it does on the website.The lobby provides free fruit and water.There is a security guard outside the building and inside the lobby at all times. This helps considering the seedy area (sleazy motels) surrounding the EC property.The flat screen was very nice, Hi-def, and approx 42in.Ipod dock on the alarm clock (no good for me since my mp3 player is a Zune).The fitness center was very nice (looking at it from the outside, hehe).The building is very quiet overall since it's not on Fremont Street.In conclusion, I think the Cabana Suites should rename their rooms to better reflect the room's amenities. Deluxe room should be the economy room, the Junior Suite should be a standard room, and the Super Suite should be a regular suite. BTW, the Super Suite comes with a queen size bed and not a king?!Overall, there was nothing unbearable about the room, however we probably won't be staying at the Cabana Suites again.	
May 22 2009 	Good rooms at a fair price.	I have stayed at the ElCo several times now. The rooms are clean and the amenities good. Some of the fixtures in the bathroom are cheap, but they are still better than the ones in my apartment. Nothing fancy and that's how I like it if I'm staying downtown.If I want more excitement, I stay on the Strip.The staff is good; the customers look ... average to a bit rugged. (Hey, do I *become* haggard and rugged when I stay there?) I hope to visit again soon	
Apr 3 2009 	Bang for the Buck Loose Penny 	I have stayed at the El Cortez a few time now and I have to first state it ain't swanky. Now I have to state join the Players club its the best bang and best comps you will ever get from a downtown casino. The first time I stayed I couldn't find a room anywhere downtown and normally stay at the Four Queens ironically they never ever sent me a bigger comp than buy one room get one free and after one stay at the EC i have never paid for a room again, and gotten slot cash and free food. The hotel is Vintage but not rundown it has recently undergone some serious remodeling to the tune of $25million dollars that doesn't mean all rooms or areas are affected but the Restraunt is alot nicer than it once was and the food has always been good with very very reasonable prices. This hotel maxes the amount of money you can spend gambling by reducing the amount you spend on food, amenities etc. The rooms always have fresh linens, don't smell and very clean, the furniture is older and big the rooms are spacious, some have flat screen tv's some don't. I reccomend this hotel for adults not kids or teenagers. The Casino floor is big and spacious the machines are not pushed together but roomy you never feel like its a smoky even though everyone is smoking unlike the Four Queens they push all the machines as close together as possible to put more in and it always feels smokey. Avoid the pavillion rooms as they are outside in the parking garage, go for the Vintage rooms or Tower Rooms or better yet the new Cabanna Suites that look awesome but I haven't stayed in one yet just took a tour. People are mostly friendly and only once has anyone been some what short with me but I attribute that to my drunkeness(lol). Drinks don't come as often as in other casinos unless the floor is really busy they staff according to the amount of people in casino. The crowd is mixed mostly adults and seniors but on one of my stays I had some great fun with some college kids and they liked the place. The El Cortez is a practical, low cost, high player rewards, somewhat loose slots, good poker tables, place with decently priced hotel rooms I would compare to say a Best Western or Holiday Inn Express but roomier. I have since stayed 5 times and never paid for a room since my first stay I have never paid for food since my first stay as you can use your points to pay for food with players club card. I have stayed three times in a Vintage room once in a Pavillion room and once in a Tower room, so I have seen it all and over the past two years many improvements have been made inlcuding new carpet, new slots, some flat screen tv's, for pay wifi access, restraunt remodeled, and a gift shop was added that has lots of medicinals you might need and not severely over priced to my surprise. Would stay there again and again. BTW my first stay I won' $200 on a quarter slot, my last stay I won $300 on a 2cent slot machine yes they have those there. The new Cabana Suites have a business and fitness center.	
Mar 31 2009 	Top Value Downtown	The El Cortez is the best value play downtown. Just close enough to Fremont St. to be accessible; just far enough away for some peace. Rooms are large, clean though a bit dated. So what, I'm just sleeping there. Casino not quite rockin' but good, relaxed place to play. Bartenders great. Waitresses okay. Decent sports book for downtown. Food was good. For the money, this spot is a no-brainer. If you're expecting the Strip - go to the Nugget. But for low rates and high value, the El Cortez cannot be beat. Oh, by the way, very safe. Only a block from Fremont St. Experience and can easily walk to and fro without the least bit of worry. Deuce bus stops a few steps away for fast trip to the Strip.	
Mar 29 2009 	A hotel where I can go back to and enjoy the stay	The room was wonderful, my husband and I took our two boys with us, so we were gratefull that our room was big and clean. The staff was great and profetional. We had an awesome experience while we stay in the hotel. The Freemont Street Experience is right across the street. We did have to drive to get to the strip since it is kind of far. The only complain we had was that my husband went down to the casino a few times and no one offer him a drink!I would defenetly recommend staying at this hotel, but I would not recommend the casino.	
Mar 29 2009 	Will Stay Again!	Decided on Las Vegas and the last minute for our yearly vacation so we couldn't do a lot of homework for our stay like it like to do with &quot;Trip Advisor&quot; but our travel agent booked us into the El Cortez because she knew we like to stay near Fremont Street. What a gem of a place! Yes you could see that the room had older furniture, but the room was very clean and the beds were comfortable. What more could you ask for. We did have trouble the first night with noisy neighbors but that is certainly not the hotels fault, your in VEGAS BABY!! We had a few meals in the 24 hour restaurant and always had a good meal, but would think twice about Robertas for the Flame or whatever the are calling it now. Not the best service we have ever had (see sep review0 Over all we would stay at the El Cortez the next time we are in town.	
Dec 31 2008 	What a room!	I arrived in LV a day earlier than scheduled &amp; could not get into the strip hotel I had booked (they were FULL) so I decided to go DT to see what they had. I decided upon staying at the EC (it was only for 1 night). I got a Vintage room with a Queen bed (Located above casino floor) &amp; did not expect much for $30. I was blown away! This is supposed to be a standard room, but it looked more like a suite. The bathroom was small, but clean, with old looking fixtures, that worked fine (that's why they call it Vintage). The room had a Big L shaped sofa/couch surrounding a nice table &amp; a Flat screen TV. The bed was very comfortable (not small at all). The closet was Huge with plenty of space. There was a nice view of Fremont street (without any noise problems, from the street or casino). The food was good, at a great price (for LV).The downers (2): The casino is more like a bingo parlor than a casino (but there are other places to gamble, within walking distance) &amp; you have to WALK up to the 2nd floor, NO elevator (I HATE to walk, but this was no big deal for me to deal with).I almost stayed here my whole trip, but I had other reservations (&amp; paid a deposit) at a strip hotel. I wish I would have eaten that deposit &amp; stayed here at the EC. This room made my Spa suite at the Luxxx (strip hotel not mentioned) seam like a cracker box &amp; a BIG waste of money. Sure, the NEWer suite had a Jacuzzi tub, that took FOREVER to Fill &amp; Drain (basically worthless) &amp; the furniture there was Spartan indeed (a small table &amp; 2 rickety chairs). I could have saved close to $500 &amp; stayed here (wish I had).	
Dec 26 2008 	I heart the El C!	I stayed at the El Cortez for 3 nights, I had a group rate and the price was worth every penny. I had a King Tower room, I didn't have a view (well, it was of the A/C and the roof), but the room was very nice. The king bed was ok, with very soft pillows. There was a small loveseat , chair and cocktail table. There was a large desk and they have WIFI for $11.99 for 24 hours. The bathroom was small and the lighting was poor in there but not terrible. Overall it was a great room! The El Cortez is only a block from the Fremont Street Experience, so you are close to several casinos. I did order room service once and I was surprised at how inexpensive it was! Both my friend and I ate for under $15.00 with the room service fee! The food was came up fairly quickly and was delicious. I would stay at the El C anytime, the tower rooms look fairly new and it was very clean. Just don't expect a 5 star resort and you will be fine.	
Dec 25 2008 	Pleasantly Surprised	This was my first stay Downtown and I decided to book the El Cortez on the word of other TA Members who had stayed there. I had no idea what to expect. When I got to my room, I was pleasantly surprised. I thought the room was big and liked the layout. I had a one bed tower room that had a great view of the Strip and mountains in the distance. The only thing I could see someone having a problem with is the height of the shower. I'm short, so it was OK, but a tall person might find it annoying. Everyone I met during my stay was friendly and the casino had a &quot;homey&quot; feel unlike the huge Strip casinos. I never felt that it was unsafe in the area outside of the casino. For anyone who really likes all the glitz of the Strip, this may not be the place for you. It's not &quot;glitzy&quot; at all. I would stay there again.	
Dec 25 2008 	No not better than expected.	What can I say except I was hugely disappointed. I felt like such a fool for picking this hotel for my family and it was devastating when we walked into our room and reality came crashing down around me. I don't know what I was thinking. Unfortunately a big factor probably was TripAdvisor's 4/5 rating and all these people saying how &quot;not so bad&quot; it is.Now that should have been an early indicator. This hotel is &quot;not that bad&quot;. &quot;Not as bad as people are saying&quot;. Oh that's nice, but is it any good? I mean, how bad were you expecting? Pavillion rooms are above the parking garage. The parking garage where the elevators are not working so you find yourself having to walk up 4 flights of stairs with all your luggage. It's ok, sometimes things break down. Once at your floor, lighting is insufficient and it's dark and wet as you try to find your room. Oh yeah, this is not indoors, the pavillion rooms lead directly outside.The professional photographs are very well taken. When I opened the door I thought there must've been a mistake. It really is no better than your run-of-the-mill cheapest motel. Much smaller than you'd think from the pictures and shabbier. There was a slight odor I'd rather not think about. The bathroom is tiny and cheap. There is rusting at the bottom of the toilet, a fan knob that is literally falling out, and barely enough room to turn around.I have never walked into a hotel and said immediately, &quot;we need to go somewhere else&quot;. At El Cortez, this took approximately 3 minutes. I call the front desk and after numerous &quot;we can't do this&quot;, &quot;we can't do that&quot;, &quot;we don't offer blank&quot;, &quot;you'll have to call whoever you booked with&quot;, I pause for a moment and let out a deep breath considering my options when I hear, &quot;uh... bye...&quot; *click*. Okay.So I proceed to call Expedia and there are lots of details which I won't go into here, but there are lots of expedia says this, hotel manager/supervisor says that, hotel will have to charge 100% of the 3-day stay, no wait it's just 1-day but we don't know how much that is. Supervisor says if I would've just came down right away maybe we wouldn't have to charge, but it's been about an hour so we have to. My mistake of calling expedia to see if other hotels have rooms available, if this happens to you go straight to the front desk and cancel first.Expedia gets an &quot;excellent&quot; rating from me. The rep was a savior and ended up refunding everything except for $1.77 and told me not to worry about the manager's threats of charging for the night and that Expedia would take care of it. After an hour at the Cortez, we wanted the Bellagio or MGM even if it was $200 a night. Unfortunately all the 5-stars were booked. He ran down the lists of 3-4 star hotels that were available and had no issue with providing details and even calling to ask what their internet surcharge rate was. Just FYI, very few hotels offer free internet, even the 4-5 stars, and it's usually $10-$14 a day.In the end, he booked me a 3-night stay at the 4-star Golden Nugget which is about 200 yards away from El Cortez but what a world of difference. $60 at Cortez vs $80 at Golden Nugget for 3 nights. Far nicer room, higher quality everything, thank god a clean bathroom with marble, oh wow actual chairs and tables. I would rate the Golden Nugget as average or above average. How Cortez has an above average rating here, I don't have a clue.Perhaps TripAdvisor should change the wording from &quot;Rate your overall experience&quot; to &quot;Rate your hotel&quot;. You could have an &quot;excellent&quot; experience anywhere if you're high on ecstasy. It's great that you had low expectations and enjoyed your stay but let's have some objectivity here. You must rate the hotel as it stands against all competitors. Not just give it a 4 rating because it was cheap and you made it out alive.I've stayed at the many 5-star hotels and I wouldn't rate all of those as excellent but I would rate the 3-star Homewood Suites Sandieg-Del Mar excellent. Value is an important factor. But even considering price, El Cortez is at best, &quot;Okay, but some problems&quot;. There are much better deals out there.I've been to worse hotels and have had perfectly fine stays. I'd be ok with the Cortez for some situations but not a family vacation. The rating here is misleading and that's the main problem.No matter how good user reviews are, this hotel is a one star for a reason. Just keep that in mind while scanning some of these glowing comments. I didn't and had to jump through hoops to fix things on the trip.	
Dec 20 2008 	Better than it Sounds/Looks	After reading reviews and checking prices we ended up booking the 'Cortez for our last night in Vegas for a chance to hang around Freemont. We were cautious when we got there but were told we were upgraded to a non-smoking room (as we read to request) and ended up with an awesome room!Our room was up a flight of stairs just off the main casino floor...which was reminicent of the rooms above a 'saloon' with ladies leaning over the railing. The room we were given was abosolutely enormous compared to the other places we stayed. There was a giant King bed, large tv and large L shaped couch. The bathroom was a little small but I wasn't sleeping in there so that was of little importance.If your not necessarily looking to gamble at the hotel but to check out Freemont Street, El Cortez is in a great area with free parking and a good deal if you can get an non smoking room!	
Dec 17 2008 	Fantastic Deal for Huge Room Downtown	I booked two nights at the El Cortez via Vegas.com for a total of $42! Yes! A total of $42 for two nights including the tax and booking fee. They had a special on Vegas.com of buy one night get one free and a free coupon book. The coupon book was pretty good, free drink, $5 off meal at the hotel, gambling coupons, gift coupon, etc. This was a last minute trip for us, and we were on a tight budget. We went for my birthday and to see a concert at the Hard Rock on December 12. I had to be creative with our lodging so the El Cortez it was. Plus I had not experienced downtown in years and my boyfriend had never seen the Freemont Experience.The hotel is easy to find and they valet parked the car. Check in was a breeze. We were given room 1013 (10th floor) and our window looked straight down Las Vegas Blvd. toward the strip. The nighttime view was awesome. The room was huge! Two queen beds with fresh brand new linens (beds are firm but not uncomfortable). Had plenty of storage for clothes between dresser drawers and hanging space. Bathroom is older but well maintained and clean. The toilet and shower/tub are together and vanity outside that room. There is also a loveseat with coffee table and a desk. The desk is a &quot;secretary&quot; type you don't see often and was perfect for our wet bar. This room was really huge. We had no problem keeping the room warm or cool with the thermostat. Tv worked fine. Oh, NO BLOWDRYERS! Bring your own or ask for one when you check in.The casino part of the hotel is so-so. It's kind of &quot;dead&quot;, not lively like the strip. It's hard to get a cocktail while gambling. We played only slots and they did not pay out that well. We had better luck gambling elsewhere downtown. The cafe in the hotel is GREAT for breakfast. They make the best bacon and cheese omlet I've ever had. The lobby bar made a good strong bacardi and diet too. Oh, if you want some good Mexican or Cuban food, go across the street (Freemont) and you will find some darn good food. Can't remember the name of the place, Martita's or something? Anyway, people at the hotel will know the name.In general, you will find downtown to be more somber and mellow than the strip. We are used to the strip atmosphere and this is very different. The hotel catered more to retired and cowboy types. I felt silly wearing my typical Vegas garb out since it seemed over the top for downtown (but would have fit right in on the strip). Downtown is fun but very different vibe than the strip.We did have to go to the Hard Rock on Saturday night for the concert and the cab ride after tip was about $30. Yikes! Once we got to the Hard Rock we felt the Vegas vibe we were used to. Cab ride home was a few dollars cheaper, he took a quicker route and less traffic.Overall I would stay here again if I were to stay downtown but I prefer staying on the strip if I can find a good deal.	
Nov 15 2008 	Give El Cortez a Break!	This was the second time I stayed at El Cortez. The name, in Spanish, means &quot;the courteous one&quot;, or &quot;the courteous man&quot;. I felt it lived up to that moniker. The staff was beyond lovely. They actually recognized my mom and me from the year before. Not by name. but perhaps by the fact that we're a travelling mother/daughter act. It does cater to an elderly crowd. However, I'm in my 30's and find that I'll take courtesy wherever I can get it. Also, you cannot possibly find better rates for a clean place to stay in Vegas. I loved being able to walk to the Fremont Street Experience. We cam home in the middle of the night, and felt quite safe!I won money at El Cortez, too. In the neighborhood of $600 with only $60 to start. I give it a thumbs up, definitely!	
Nov 14 2008 	Not the place for us	Myself, my sister and neice had booked to stay here from 6th November, we had read most of the reviews which all seemed favourable, so we took the chance.I have to be honest and say first impressions where not good, old and tatty came to mind. When we got to our room we were very concerned we had booked a pavillion room. This is over the car park, and it is like a 1960's massionette badly lit, the window looked out onto the walkway between rooms and the glass had wire imbedded into it, the room was also very small, even by british standards, and as 3 women we felt very vunrable and unsafe as this hotel is downtown and miles from the strip. We booked into circus circus that same night and left. When we went to check out, this was only one hour after checking in, not one question was asked as to why we where booking out, which i felt was very odd. Don't get me wrong i am not slagging the hotel or the staff off, I just felt that there were no reviews from the UK on the site, and maybe this is just not what we want from our visit to Vegas.	
Nov 6 2008 	El Cortez a Plesant stay 	My dh and i checked into the El Cortez on thurs oct 30th 2008 -it was around 2 pm. our room was ready. we got room 1101. nice, clean room and it faced the stratosphere and the big red shoe.The room was a king room. King bed -two night stands- a dresser - desk and two big chairs-love seat and coffee table- we also asked for and got a fridge.The bathroom was the tub and toilet in one room-tiny! and outside the bathroom was the sink and counter and a small closet area.The tub however fine for us (hubby 5'6 and i am 5'2) would not be good for tall people or really more than 5'7 because of the style of the tub and the height of the shower head. there was always hot water when we showered.we asked for extra pillows for our bed, as well as hangers and a blow dryer--all were provided from housekeeping!the room was cleaned very nice and they left xtra towels and soaps and shampoo for a small tip each day.The Casino is very smokey! and the crowd is older and the feeling is not lively. also when we were there we witnessed the roulette coupiers (sp) were very bad-making many mistakes and not in control of the table -i only stayed for 3 spins(that took over 40 min)then they had to review the tape because one of the morons that was causing - the time issues -was cheating or so they thought! they made many mistakes and had to be told by the people playing -and calling the pit boss over-and they were wrong each time. so i got out of there- i am still kind of new at this and cant take a chance on getting ripped off.the slots did not seam loose here at all - i only won on one machine -monopoly 5$ turned into 28$ got right out. that was the only slot win in the Elcortez and believe my i tried plenty!we were always able to find a parking spot in self park with no problems.The elevators are old and rickety-so slow and do weird up /down and pauses. (tower of terror flashback) There is a subway in the Elcortez as well as seattles best coffee. but you cannot charge these two places to your room.we ate at the 24 hour resturant twice-once for breakfast and once for a 2 am feeding. both times food was fine. hot, and okay portions.i would recomend a reservation if you want robertas we would have had a 40 min wait-so we went to the 24 hour joint.we had a pretty quiet room-although every once in a while i could hear the elevator ding.check out was fine-no comps to speak of. all in all the Elcortez was fine for us- we were youngsters there (we are fortysomethings) and although the casino is smokey -not a hint in our room!!if we found another deal there we would stay again.	
Oct 27 2008 	Best Overlooked Bargain on The Strip	We went to Vegas for the Halloween Ball/ Fetish &amp; Fantasy Ball 2008. We waited to book our room till one week before the event.We used trip advisor to find reviews on the bargain hotels offered.We saw other reviews giving it 5.0 ratings. We were unsure. We drove from Phoenix to the hotel. It is conveniently located off the freeway. Free valet parking from friendly staff. Easy to check in at a small desk. The tower rooms are nice. When we walked in we were really impressed. The room was nice, clean, absolutely no odor..(non smoking). We had two double size beds that were really comfortable. The view was down the strip. We were with in walking distance of the Freemont Street .This was a great deal.	
Oct 20 2008 	No frills Vegas	No Frills Vegas Run, My husband and I in our mid fourties needed to make a weekend run to Vegas for some business and wanted to find a cheap clean place to stay. It was Barret Jackson weekend and rates were high so, based on reviews we read here we tried the El Cortez.. At under 70 dollars a night I wasn't expecting much.  Arrived late just before midnight but room was clean and ready. The lady at check in, the bell man and valet were all very friendly. To our surpise we were given a coupon for two free nights in December.Our Tower 3rd floor room was larger than most casino rooms we have stayed in. The bed was a little firm but the sheets were crisp and clean. Bathroom was old but clean. no view but, hey its vegas we justed wanted a clean place to sleep. The only issue we had was at 6:00 am we had a little old lady outside our door trying to use her key to get into our room (she was lost). My husband yelled through the door and she left. You can hear some hallway noise in the room if the tv is off. I am a sound sleeper so this wasn't an issue for me. I would say the room is equal to a holiday inn or comfort inn. If you want glitz and glamor this isn't the place. All of the staff we encounterd were great. Loved the Bartenders as long as you are playing the drinks were flowing. We had dinner at Roberta Steak House, it was very good and about 80.00 for two without drinks. The casino wasn't our friend this trip as far as winning but we arent high rollers. It was fun. If you are on a budget this is a great place to stay and the rates are reasonable. I have stayed a lot of the cool vegas places such as Golden Nugget, Excalibur, Luxor, TI, Rio and the Palms you can't compare this hotel to those. However, if I need a cheap rate this will be my first look.	
Oct 17 2008 	Nothing Special	This is my 5th time in Vegas...1st time on Freemont Street. After looking at numerous reviews we decided to stay at the El Cortez.The staff was so unenthusiastic. Housekeeping was the worst I have ever seen...possibly understaffed. Food was ok. I will have to say we felt very safe...as far as the area. We would not go back	
Oct 16 2008	good hotel at down town	good location at the down town (!!!!).conveniant and clean room.much better than sahara and stratosphare.	
Oct 4 2008 	New Favorite	My mother and I share holidays in Las Vegas (she lives in Florida and I am overseas). We have been staying at Sahara recently, but wanted to try a Fremont hotel. I had been to El Cortez in 2000 and remember what a run down place this was, but also knew the hotel was remodelled. We were thrilled with our selection. The remodelling was total and comprehensive to a very high standard. The spirit of the hotel was fantastic.We were greeted at check-in with a long list of coupons and offers. We liked the food so much that we took all of our meals in the hotel, even after the coupons ran out. One of the staff tipped us off for newspaper coupon to dinner at Roberta's. Every meal was delicious. The room was very nice and clean....better than comparable at Sahara. The only suggestion we would offer is that the water pressure is low at certain times and showering could be slow or cold.	
Sep 28 2008 	Another great stay	well had another great stay , check in, went smooth took picture and they made me picture key chain, free slots, 2 free nite in the furture, free food, lose slots ,and when you are winning at slots ,tables and you dont want to lose that streak,well if you get hungry just ask for waiter, and get your food brought to you ,thats nice my room was nice and fresh and clean, and had a ball on fremont st. check pictures out more later.	
Sep 28 2008 	Good Value You'll get what you paid for	There's a reason it's the lowest priced hotel downtown(Fremont East District) but it's still a good bargain. I wouldn't reccoment the Pavilion section, go with the tower or vintage rooms.Note: No pool.The gambling is good and Roberta's Restaurant served some very good food for the price. Try it. There are still some old coin in type dollar slots which I liked.The noise level outside late at night can be annoying, so you may want to take that into consideration when obtaining your room. You can stay here and visit a dozen casinos or more without having to cab it. If you've never stayed downtown try it at least once, it's an experience.	
Sep 28 2008 	Couldn't be happier	We spent two nights at the El Cortez and it was probably the best stay we've ever had in Vegas. With the help of a coupon from the American Casino Guide, we spent $30 for two nights in one of their vintage rooms, a huge, clean, and well-furnished suite. Yes, $30 total, $15 a night before tax. These rooms seem to get a bad rap, and we're not sure why.Our room was clean, quiet, and just a few steps from the casino, very convenient. It had a big living room area with a sectional couch, two closets, a big comfortable King-sized bed, and a separate dressing room/sitting room. It was a smoking room, but there was very little smoke smell and no noise whatsoever from the casino downstairs. It's a very old building, but it's in nice shape and has lots of character, a rarity in Vegas. Also, there were gobs of storage: Two nightstands, an armoire and a big dresser in addition to two generous closets. And the furniture wasn't cheap hotel furniture either, it was real wood stuff that I'd be proud to have in my house.The vintage rooms do have a few drawbacks, however. There's no elevator, so you'll need to drag your luggage up the stairs. Also, the bathrooms are very small. And it's obvious that it's an old building--the floors creak sometimes, there aren't many electrical outlets etc. This stuff didn't bother us in the least, but other people might feel differently.The steakhouse and coffee shop are great too, above average food at bargain prices. And everyone at the El Cortez, from the front desk to the hostesses at the restaurant to the security guards went out of their way to make us feel welcome and valued. Safety seems to be a concern for a lot of people downtown, but we never felt unsafe. Obviously, it's a city, and you need to be aware of your surroundings and keep track of you're valuables. But we never felt any less safe than on the Strip. We had a great time and an unbelievable hotel value and hope to come back for many more.	
Sep 15 2008 	good value	Big clean room in the tower. Good location. Great valet. Terrific food at the cafe with generous comps. Weird blackjack sidebets with lots of locals who give you a hard time for not betting the side bet and dealers barely proficient at English. Still, I left with more cash than I arrived with. I may stay there again...it's a good bargain.	
Aug 29 2008 	I Surprised My Guests!	I booked 3 nights at the El Cortez for two friends and I just to prove what a great hotel it really is, and they were knocked-out with the great room, service and food, just as I had anticipated. First, check- in was quick, and our Tower Strip-View room was very cool inside with outdoor temps hovering over 110... The classic hardwood furnishings and decor pleased my most particular friend. The beds were extremely comfortable. The bathroom was of adequate size, regardless what others have posted here...We're average sized guys and none of us felt confined in there. Plenty of hot water for our 3 long showers, and the drain drained properly too... The soaps, shampoos and etc were of fine quality, and supplied daily with the thick towels provided. What more could we ask for? The room was quite soundproof, and we didn't hear any noise from other guests at any time during our stay, and we slept at all sorts of hours too. The housekeepers did an excellent job of cleaning daily, so a hefty tip was in order!The casino is great for us low-rollers, and we were able to play for quite a long time on our budgets. Cocktail service was excellent too, no matter where in the casino we were. That $1 tip brings that server back often! Oh, the food was great, especially with our $5 'Fun Book' coupons. A large Prime Rib dinner with all the etc in Kitty's for $6 was primo! The breakfast buffet will have you full all day too. All the El Cortez servers were top-drawer and courteous... I now have a couple more friends to join me for a gamblin' vacation anytime for little $$$, and we highly recommend it too!	
Aug 21 2008 	great place to stay	stayed at the el cortez for five nights,rooms were clean,front desk and management were very effecient.bartenders were helpful and courteous.ate in all the restraunts and food prices were economical and never had a bad meal.security is visible at all times outside as well as on the floor.Fremont expierience is a block away and freeway is close for fast access to all other sites if you drive.will stay again.	
Aug 17 2008	WOW!!!!! More than expected!!!!!	WOW!!!! First off this place is GREAT!!!!! They allowed us to check in early and gave us a free upgrade to a tower room. The tower rooms were spacious with 2 queen beds and the seating alcove. The non-smoking rooms smelled fresh with out even a hint of cigarette odor. A fridge was delivered free of charge just by asking for it. Our meal at Roberta's was the best of the trip (the 50% off coupon made it an even better deal!!!!) For my Guy's trip this was ideal as the Fremont St. experence was easily within walking distance. This place was so good that I would be willing to bring my wife next time (and she is definetly a tougher critic) I feel that these rooms were even better than the room we stayed in at the Monte Carlo in March!!!!	
Aug 2 2008 	Good deal!	Booking through hotel.com was a breeze. The El Cortez is situated a block from the Fremont Street Experience which means it is quieter and less frenetic. I stayed at a Vintage Room which has the cheapest rate. Sure, you have to lug your bags up a short flight of stairs but the room is big (2 queen size beds) and very clean. It had none of the smokey smell either.Checking-in was also a breeze and the staff was quite friendly and courteous.	
Jul 31 2008	If You Want No Sleep Stay Here...	I am currently staying here, july 31 08, I made a BIG mistake and booked a 10 day stay. The first two nights i stayed in the older section in which the doors open to the outside. This is noise central, or cell block 5. The first night and second night both I was kept awake by fighting etc in the hall and security had to come. I was moved to the tower (as a free upgrade) my third night and the people next door were in and out all night. (Drunk and LOUD and more) who knows. You can hear every noise from 4four doors down, the doors slamming, loud drunk people coming in all hours of the night. In contacting the front desk when there is a problem they are NOT CONCERNED, They pass you on to security and security passes you back to the front desk. DO NOT STAY HERE. In vegas look around, there are so many places that are nice and quiet. THIS IS NOT IT. Stay here if you want a noisy environment, and if you like thinking you are in a old folks home for the homeless. it is digusting and stinks. good luck	
Jul 27 2008	Never Again!!! Un-American Hotel Policies!!	I have stayed at El Cortez before, with no problems whatsoever - and gave them a favorable review at the time; BUT my stay last week will be my last.First, the good things: the room was clean again; the staff were courteous; the bellstaff and valets were particularly helpful when my shuttle back to the airport failed to show up, having booked me for &quot;a.m.&quot; instead of &quot;p.m.&quot; pick up.The bad things: There was not enough water pressure in the shower to wash shampoo out of my hair - all week, despite having reported it on Monday. The icemaker was out for the last 3 days of my stay - despite the malfunction being reported promptly and temperatures each day being over 100 degrees; I had to go to the casino bar to request ice. Most of the electrical outlets in the room were shorted out, and I required one for a CPAP machine nightly.The WORST thing, and the reason why I will not return: I do not drive, so my passport is my primary (and only government-issued) form of identification. Although I was registered with no incident on my prior stay, this time I had to deal with 3 people before the hotel would honor my reservation because the hotel has a policy of NOT ACCEPTING A U.S. PASSPORT OR MILITARY ID for identification purposes. But, my hotel slot club player's card was accepted to permit me to register!! Something's wrong with this picture.There are people staying here from countries all around the world - who, obviously, do NOT have U.S. state-issued photo identification - and their passports are accepted but a U.S. Passport or MILITARY ID is NOT!!!! Additionally, we're being told to &quot;green up&quot; our way of living, but we have to have a driver's license to stay at this hotel! I don't think so.In my opinion, El Cortez's policy of refusing to accept a U.S. Passport of Military ID is unpatriotic, un-American, biased, discriminatory, and just plain assinine! I'll spend my money at locations where the American Military and our Country are respected more than a company slot card of foreign passport.	
Jul 9 2008 	Save $ with ample space downtown!	Readers, I spent four nights at the &quot;ElCo&quot;, from 22-25 June 2008. I used the &quot;Buy 1 night, get one night free&quot; coupon from the American Casino Guide, for a Sunday arrival. I reserved a Vintage room for these four nights, because the telephone clerk told me that I could add Tuesday and Wednesday nights at the &quot;Casino Rate&quot; ($22 per night). FOUR nights, $74 total, before taxes. Wow!! To make it even better, at check-in, I received a voucher for two FREE nights in September!I arrived at 1PM on Sunday afternoon. I was delayed THREE times at the front desk, before I was given a room at nearly 3 PM. This delay was the only problem I had at the ElCo. I did not use the $20 bill trick, because I did not think there would be any advantage among the Vintage rooms.I moved into a room on the top(5th) floor of the Pavilion rooms. This room was VERY large! It was extremely clean, and the bed&amp;bathroom were massive. YES, the Pavilion rooms are in a combination tower and parking garage, but I was very impressed at how well this worked for me! Since I drove to Las Vegas this time, I parked my car on the 4th floor, and my room was just upstairs, a few steps away! The elevators directly into the casino were fast and convenient, opening about 30 feet away from the restaurant.The casino is clean and innovative, with excellent table games, new slots machines, and even vintage coin-in slot machines! The blackjack games are the VERY BEST that I have seen in Las Vegas...single-deck pitch game, with 3:2 blackjack, and a $5 minimum! The Sports&amp;Race book is clean, large, and fully-equipped; I watched five baseball games at the same time!There is Texas Hold-Em around the clock, sometimes with $20 buy-in! It's always easy to get into a game, with a wide variety of player quality.The food is very good. Careful Kitty's is a 24-hour diner, and there is also a breakfast buffet/Chinese food buffet. If you prefer, there is also a Subway. My favorite food, though, was at the small Pizza/Lasagna restaurant diagonally across Fremont Street. Two large slices of pizza and a Diet Coke for exactly $5.The location is convenient. Two blocks from the highway interchange, two blocks down Fremont Street from the Fremont Street Experience canopy, and adjacent to the neon relics of the new Fremont East zone. If you prefer a serious slice of low-rollers, you can look two blocks east to the Western Hotel&amp;Casino.The shortcomings of the ElCo need to be noted. There are no stage shows, but there is a piano bar. There is no swimming pool, and the customer base is very old. This casino is definitely running exactly as it did in the 1960s, only with upgraded air quality. This is an adult establishment, for gamblers. If you need to stay in a hotel filled with &quot;hot bodies&quot;, fire up the credit card to the tune of $200 per night and stay at the Rio, Palms, or Hard Rock. I'll prefer the Rat Pack-style casino at the ElCo.I will return to the ElCo.

Jun 25 2008 	LOVED THE EL CORTEZ	We stayed at the El Cortez from June19 thru 22. We had a tower room, upon check in I had asked for a corner room,but they had none available. We requested a roll away bed because my daughter had a slight mishap and sparined her ankle, so the bed was free of charge, they also provided a wheelchair , but in the casino and cafe only. We were in room 509, very clean 2 beds, a sofa, we needed a fridge , that was brought up right away. the Bathroom ( a little small for 4 women ) but adaquate!. The TV was not a flat screen, but it was big, there was a desk also, which we used for a vanity table. The Air was EXTREMELY COLD, but after walking in the sun, it was refreshing to come into the room. The only complaint we had was on check out day, there was very little HOT water.... other than that, our stay was excellent. The ElCortez Staff was professional and friendly, everyone was courteous and asked us if everything was fine. My sister was given a free enrty for the slot tournament and she ended up winning $100.00.We played on the Roulette tables for a long time and we even learned how to play craps there and we won! It was great! We did eat at Kitty's cafe, the portions were huge and we used a coupon from the fun book. We also drank at the bar in the back by Kitty's, the Batender was from Brooklyn..... He made my sister a drink for her Birthday, and he was very amusing and friendly, we sat there for at least an hour.Overall, We will back to the El Cortez., the location and the price and just the overall freindliness of the staff is remarkable.	
Jun 24 2008 	It is OK for the price you pay!	Me and my sister stayed at the El Cortez for a few nights in March this year. Overall the hotel was ok, just what you would expect for the price you pay. The rooms are spacious and clean. Ours had lovely views of the hills. Only downside was that there was no hairdryer and we had a room close to the lifts so it was very noisy. The lobby and casino area were ok. Looked pretty old fashioned and full of old people so if you are under 50-60 you will feel a bit weird. Didn't bother us too much though as we only used the hotel to sleep in and not much else. The area around it was ok. It is a good bit away from the strip but if you have a car it's fine and there are also frequent buses running. You also have a good few bars and 'very important for us' a starbucks 5 minutes walk away.I would recommend this hotel if you just look for a cheap place to stay while in Vegas or if you are over 50. If you are in your 20s, like us, and looking for a cooler Vegas experience then spend the extra few bucks and book a room on the strip.	
Jun 17 2008	Great service great value	My husband &amp; I booked a week's stay at the El Cortez, just a block from the Fremont Street experience. I was skeptical about staying in downtown Vegas, but I can honestly say I had no reason for doubts. From the bell service as soon as we arrived, through our last day's checkout, we were treated like old friends &amp; valued customers, even though this was our first stay there. My husband even got to play poker with the owner! The casino smells fresh &amp; is breathable when you walk in, despite the smokers - something unique, in my experience. We had a jacuzzi suite, which would have gone for much more on the Strip - but you have to call the hotel to get one. They've been reserved in the past for high rollers &amp; pit bosses. It was a great value at $125 for a weeknight. They've just recently been made available to the public &amp; I'm so glad we booked one!! Everything about this smaller hotel &amp; casino was clean, friendly, value-oriented (the players' club is defeinitely worth joining) &amp; focused on customer service. This will definitely be our place from now on!	
Jun 13 2008 	El Cortez Is Not Bad	We went to Vegas last week and stayed at the MGM...but I also booked a room at the El Cortez for $30 one night/free the next for a &quot;Vintage Room&quot; because I figured if we wanted to hang out downtown...a $30 room for 2 nights was cheaper than a DUI driving back to the strip! We arrived early and they had a room ready for us. Check in was quick. Hotel room was nothing fancy, but very clean. View was of a wall...but not a big deal to us. Cleaning lady &quot;cleaned up&quot;/got rid of some things we had left laying out from other casino's such as playing cards from the Four Queens, etc. which I found kind of strange, but oh well...no harm done. Roberta's was a GREAT place to eat, especially with the 1/2 off coupon I had, and I loved the casino there. Walk felt very safe from Freemont experience as long as you stayed on the same side of the street as the El Cortez. Saw 2 security guards on that side. Other side had some people begging for money, etc.	
Jun 11 2008	Nice Hotel Away from Strip	This Hotel was great. It is away from the strip but a short bus ride to the strip. Everything is cheap down here so it saves you a ton of cash. When we arrived at the hotel to check in they gave us a free 2night stay if we returned next month and a room up grade!!! Take we only paid $28 a night!! Yes $28 a night. Then we received coupons to the buffet that was there. So we both ate for $7 at a buffet!! Yeah the buffet wasn't all that but it was almost free which made it great! Table start at like $5 won over $100 in blackjack. I enjoyed this casino I don't think I will stay on the stripe again. Can't beat the proce the staff is friendly and you get 2 enjoy downtown las vegas	
Jun 7 2008 	Great Value- Great Location- Great Casino	The El Cortez is one of the best kept secrets on Freemont Street. I booked a tower room for $57/night on the weekend. The strip places are way overpriced on weekends, plus there is a lot to see downtown. The El Cortez attracts a lot of locals, which is always a good sign. The casino is friendly and easy to navigate. Excellent choices for video poker players from a penny up. Players card gives new players a free $5 in play. The garage is close to the hotel, and free to park. The hotel is just 1 block from the beginning of the Freemont Street experience, located in the recently-cleaned up Freemont East district. This part of town is now safe to walk alone at night, I did during my stay. The beds are comfortable, air conditioning works well, and elevators are quick. The window does not open the full way, and they charge $12/day for internet access if you need it. The only drawback is the small bathroom, but it is clean and functional. The shower pressure here is probably in the top 5 best of any hotel I have been to in recent trips to Vegas. I will be staying here again, and the staff is very nice. I was able to check in early.	
Jun 5 2008 	A good experience all around	My tower room was clean, spacious, nicely furnished (couch! coffee table! desk! comfy king bed!), and a haven from the cigarette smoke wisping everywhere in Vegas. The A/C was powerful, the bathroom was small, and the decor feels 60s without the decades of wear. Hall noise was only occasional and acceptable. Only thing that gave me pause was the door lock: While it's sturdy when bolted from the inside, there isn't a tight seal when you arrive - and gouges in the doorjamb show that once upon a time someone without a key wanted in. Those gouges may be archaic; the El Cortez's neighborhood has improved markedly since my 2001 downtown stay. There's a noticeable amount of riffraff on the streets, but the illumination and guards and tourist traffic prevent insecurity. The friendly Freemont St. vibe feels like a street fair instead of the brassier strip: less crowded, less expensive, more laidback, less youthful energy (good &amp; bad). The slow bus to the strip runs regularly, and does get crowded.The EC's restaurants and locals-heavy casino aren't glitzy; lots of jeans, pullovers, comfort food. The coupons and comps received at check-in were appreciated. Even without them, I'd be likely to return to El Cortez. For me, it was a low-key, comfortable place to stay.	
Jun 3 2008	I am now a true believer!	I remember the El Cortez as a scary, lonesome place that Fremont forgot! The recent renovations east of Fremont and at the hotel itself has garnered it very good reviews, so I signed up for Memorial Day weekend. I am now a bona fide believer. An early check in was a breeze. I was given an 11th floor room in the Tower, facing the Strip. Rooftops by day, great lights and sights @ night. The room was good sized, with big, manly, oversized furniture. The sofa in the window alcove was terrific. Great place for coffee and a morning paper. The very small bath and kind of awkward tub/shower was functional. Great, new big towels. The king bed was very comfortable.Staff was very friendly and efficient. My 1st stop was the ice machine, which was not working. I called the desk and reported it, asking if there was ice on every floor. They said &quot;yes&quot;, and in a few minutes I went to the elevator to hit a new floor for ice. When it opened, the repair guy was getting off to fix the problem. The lobby and piano bars are beautiful, with the newest in gaming equipment. The rest of the casino is a blend of new, older and VERY old machines. The deeper into the casino, the more you see the old El Cortez. A bit worn, a bit rough around the edges. But overall, fine with lots of $5 BJ (opened some $3 BJ for a while). Free slot tournament daily if you do a small amount of points on your card. The restaurants were night and day. Roberta's was sensational. Good service and an Idaho trout &quot;special&quot;. Flown in daily, it was prepared perfectly, with a great bread basket, salad and sides for ------ $14.95. Find that somewhere else!!! The cafe however was the opposite. Prices looked great, but service was poor and the food was worse (except for great desserts!). They had a good, smiling crowd, so maybe I was unlucky. I did not use the buffet.Easy walk to Fremont for a terrific &quot;Queen Tribute&quot; on the big &quot;canopy&quot;. They finally got that right. It was electrifying!! Downtown was packed, everyone was having a fun time, with a very good, live band doing covers of great 70's tunes! I really like downtown. The Duece bus is a block away from the hotel and will bring you anywhere on the strip. Why? You're downtown!!I will be back to the El Cortez for weekends on my Vegas trips. Good room and service, excellent prices, the bartender knows your name and I love that walkway (cobblestone and palm trees) to Fremont. Bob Mp.s. try the amazing pizza (2 huge slices &amp; soda - $4) at Andy's, a 1/2 block up Fremont, next to the Griffin!!	
May 23 2008 	El Cortez Always Comfortable.	Great place to stay. Very cordial staff. Let me check in very early without question. Tower rooms are the best deal. They are very large and comfortable. This isn't a ritzy strip type place so don't expect it to be. For a Downtown place it can't be beat.Probably not the best for first timers or youngsters but for the middle aged crowd and up it is ideal.Lots of security and very comfortable. Good food choices in all price ranges.	
May 16 2008 	Big rooms however cigarette smoke was very strong.	A pretty cheap place to stay. Paid US$52 excluding tax. The rooms were big. Towels were clean. However, the rooms, even the non smoking ones, smelt very strongly of cigarette smoke. I changed 2 rooms and the smell was still there. In the end, I gave up and just slept there for one night. Probably the smoke came from the central air con, but I am not sure. Another thing was that, in order to go from the parking garage to the rooms, you had to pass through the casino. Seems like that is quite common with hotels with casinos in Vegas. This hotel has no free wifi but has free parking.	
May 14 2008 	Great deal near the Fremont Experience (old strip)	Booked this because it was cheap on I4vegas.comOther than a VERY smoky hotel lobby, we loved it. we were upgraded. the valet service is very quick and free (we tipped) and it is a couple of short blocks to the Deuce - the bus which runs up and down Las Vegas avenue for $2 a ride or $5 for the day. It is only a couple of blocks from &quot;The Fremont Experience&quot; which is the old strip where a party atmosphere reigns. There are street performances, casinos, Chippendales ready to be photographed with you for a fee, drinks at will and on and on. This is a great bargain because you have a lot of money to do other stuff like see great shows, or just watch people, or gamble if that's why you go to LV! Check in was painless as was check out. Definitely would stay there again.	
May 5 2008 	winner	I took a gamble on the elco because the rates were so good.I was definitely a winner .Check in was a breeze.My wife always checks the rooms first before we sign, we were both very satisfied and comfortable with it.We were giving many 2 for1 meal coupons and 5$ off each for there restraunts. We used them all .The food was great .The prime rib at Kittys was one of the best.($9.95).Downtown has changed.Cleaned up,expanded, tight security,made for the best downtown trip we've had. the sidewalks have been widend for several blocks up and around Fremont street .I highly recommend the elco for the fun after fifty crowd. sam	
Apr 25 2008 	Would stay again!	Thanks to all the other reviews we weren't alarmed by the neighborhood.We felt safe walking the two blocks to Fremont Street at all hours of the day or night.This was a complete different Las Vegas trip, as we are used to the hotels on the strip. The El Cortez was perfectly fine for our needs. Check in was fast. The tower room on the 3rd floor was huge and perfectly clean. The bed was great! No view of the strip from this room however.The casino was pretty lucky.You must try the Top Gun slot machine by the elevators! It is fun to play and we cashed out big three times in about 20 minutes--practically paid for our trip.	
Apr 16 2008 	Got Our Money's Worth	My husband and I just returned from a 2 night stay at this hotel. It is located just a very short walk from the Fremont Experience area, and was easy to find from the freeway.A previous review I had read was accurate regarding the check-in process. We had booked our stay a month in advance thru Expedia however the clerk could not seem to locate our pre-paid reservation. He asked us to step aside while his manager looked into this. All in all it took 30 minutes to get this straightened out (clerk was apparently mis-typing our name into his computer), and the rest of the stay was just fine.The hotel and our room were clean and seemed to be well kept. There was not a mini-fridge in the room as I had hoped, so we just used our small ice chest. An ice machine was conveniently just down the hall from our room. If staying in the tower, I would reccomend requesting an odd numbered room, as these are the ones that face the strip and offer a great night time view.The valet area was swamped and there was a short wait for our vehicle. When going out to the strip the valet called a cab for us which showed up almost immediately. We enjoyed the more intimate feel of this hotel, as opposed to the enormous grounds of the newer hotels on the strip. And this was well worth the money.We will definately return.	
Apr 16 2008 	Nice hotel for the price	Just came back from the cortez, stayed in the tower room, nice, clean room, maid service everyday. didn't hear any construction going at all. the hotel is in a good location, no problems, close to fremont street experience, and double deuce about 5 min. away. all in all nice place for the money.	
Apr 14 2008 	Some Good - Some Problems	Ive been going to Las Vegas since 1979. I believe that the first two times you visit, you should stay on the Strip, walk around with your eyes and mouth wide open, experience the overpriced hotels, tight slots, high minimums at the tables, and the underpaying video poker machines. By your third trip, youre ready to stay Downtown. Which brings us to El CortezEl Cortez is NOT a place for first time visitors to Las Vegas. I also do not recommend it if you are not familiar with downtown Las Vegas.LOCATIONEl Cortez is located on Fremont Street, one block east of Las Vegas Boulevard between 6th and 7th Streets. It is two blocks from the &quot;Fremont Street Experience&quot; in an area that used to be considered seedy, but with new construction in the area, a well lighted walkway directly from Las Vegas Boulevard to the front door on 6th Street, and the presence of security personnel on Fremont Street, I felt safe walking. The area has plenty of foot traffic till midnight. I cannot account for activity after midnight..CHECK INSmooth, quick, efficient. THE ROOMI stayed in a PAVILION ROOM -- so all comments refer to a Pavilion Room only.The Pavilion concept is very clever. Half of the main parking garage has an extra floor; and on this top floor is a 72-room motel. The room was spacious for a motel room. Two people can move around without bumping into each other. The paint, carpet, etc were in good condition. Drawers and closet space were ample. The bed was comfortable. The linens were clean.The bathroom was tiny. A rotund guest would find it uncomfortable. The sink was located outside the bathroom. The sink area contained adequate counter space. The shower stream was steady and strong. The water temperature, however, was inconsistent.The A/C worked very well and very quietly. It was the type of A/C that didnt turn on/off based on temperature. This will be a plus for those who wake up every time a heater/AC turns on or off.I did not watch television, so I can't comment on picture quality or station availability.The room contained a clock radio. There was no safe, fridge, microwave. There was no desk or table. There was no full-length mirror.The perimeter of the motel is a walkway which provides a nice view from three sides and a view of the parking garage roof from the 4th.If you have a car, you can take an elevator directly up to the motel or down to the casino.There could be several problems if youre a light sleeper. You can hear the TV in the next room. You can hear people coughing through the air vents. My room overlooked 7th Street and I could hear street noise. A major problem for a light sleeper would be the sound of doors closing. We all know that hotel doors make a noise when you close them -- a result of the automatic lock engaging. However, you can usually mitigate the noise by closing the door gently. The Pavilion doors, however, would not close from the outside unless you pulled them hard, so that no matter how quiet you tried to be, the door made a loud noise. I was by myself, but I can just imagine the problems a couple would have if spouse-1 left the room early while spouse-2 was still sleeping.HOUSEKEEPINGI left the room in the morning. When I came back at night, the room had been cleaned. What more can I ask? In addition, my shower tended to drip water on the floor requiring a second floor-towel. When housekeeping noticed that I was using a bath towel as a second floor-towel, they provided a second floor-towel -- a minor incident, but it shows thoughtfulness and a willingness to help the guest without being asked. ELEVATORSI was there seven days and never once even came close to thinking Whats taking so long . Very efficient.SECURITYCameras cover every inch of the Pavilion area and I often encountered a security guard. No one checks room keys as you access the Pavilion floor, so anyone can access the Pavilion floor from the casino and parking garage. For me the ultimate security test is this: would I feel comfortable if my wife or daughter were staying here alone; my answer would be no.PARKINGThere is complimentary self-parking in their garage. There is also valet parking which I never investigated. The garage itself is roomy and easy to navigate.SUMMARYYou dont buy a Ford Focus and complain that its not a Mercedes. This is an economy hotel. I was here by myself and Im not a light sleeper, so I didnt have to worry about the security and noise issues mentioned above. If you want a quieter, more secure environment downtown for approximately the same price, check my review of the Las Vegas Club.	
Apr 7 2008 	Beware of Construction Noise	Yes the rooms are large and fairly clean, the hotel entrance and general area much better than it was afew years ago. However, there was a good deal of construction going on at the new tower being built right next door, and it began at 6 a.m. It penetrated our 4th floor north facing room and from conversations with other guests during our 4 days it seemed to bother many on that side. A move to a higher south side room helped. For us, it was just an ok place with a reasonable rate on Easter weekend, we wouldn't return in a hurry. Had an excellent Easter morning breakfast at the cafe.	
Apr 2 2008 	Repeat Visitor to the El Cortez	One of the few remaining genuine &quot;Old Vegas&quot; hotel\casinos.I hate using &quot;Old Vegas&quot; since that is what the Strip visitors call downtown Fremont Street area. But it is an older Vegas hotel and has that feel about it.I like the hotel and the casino. There is some age to the rooms, but they are clean and my room was quiet and it was a bargain.The walk to the Fremont Street Experience feels safe now with the block between there and the hotel having been upgraded in the past few years.I will definitely return again.	
Mar 1 2008 	Another Good Visit to the El Cortez....	I made a solo trip to Las Vegas and stayed for three nights(Feb. 24-27) at the El Cortez. I was able to check into a Pavilion Room when I arrived at 2:00 . It was fine--a non-smoking room --# 5503. There was a good view of the area when standing outside on the cement walkway.The bed was comfortable, the room was quiet, the walkway was well-lit, and the staff were helpful. I ate in the coffee shop different times---always good. I walked across Fremont Street and ate a breakfast at Mamacita's, which was also good---also, good drink service while gamblinga at the El Co.I have been gambling/staying at the El Cortez for the past few years and have always had very good experiences. I will be returning in two months.	
Feb 26 2008 	A Great Value in Old Las Vegas	I lived in Las Vegas for over 20 years, and recently stayed in the El Cortez to be with family for a family wedding. I was quite surprised at how nice our room and the overall experience were. The El Cortez brought in new management a while back you can tell- bit by bit they are upgrading the property. The &quot;gourmet&quot; restaurant Roberta's was great (including a great &quot;Stone Crab&quot; special). Our room was very big and nicely appointed. The location is in the &quot;East Fremont&quot; area which is currently undergoing renovation (across the street is a large luxury high rise condominium). Many hotels in Las Vegas are nicer, but they are also MUCH more expensive. If you are want to save more dollars for the tables, I highly recommend the El Cortez as a great place to stay (and getting greater by the month!)	
Feb 24 2008 	Cheap adequate but my room was VERY COLD!	I had one of the &quot;Vintage&quot; rooms, a real bargain at under $50 a night early week, about $75 on weekends. But when the weather turned cold on my second night, so did the room. I could not figure out how to get heat, only air, COLD air! I complained twice to the front desk but nobody ever came to help fix the temperature, so I just had to bundle up. Otherwise I would have lkiked this hotel. It's in a great downtown location, away from the hideous and gaudy Strip, but only a block from the Deuce bus that runs up and down the Strip, and it''s only two blocks from the Fremont St. Experience. The casino has a very good coffee shop for cheap home style meals and breakfast at any hour. There's also a 24-hour Subway sandwich shop and an inexpensive buffet open for breakfast, brunch and dinner (Chinese).	
Jan 26 2008 	The last piece of real Las Vegas-it's great!	Here is the bottom line on the El Cortez(and the other downtown properties as well).Reasonably well kept,safe, clean and comfortable-if you have enough common sense to know what to expect.It never fails to amaze me that people expect,because it's Vegas,that you can get a suite like you see on TV shows for 30$ per night.If you want the sterilized,non Las Vegas atmosphere of the Strip you must pay the price.The 3$ call brand drink downtown is twice that or more there.The rooms and food are terribly expensive as well.I am a 30 year Vegas visitor,and I left the strip years ago.I like the old Vegas feel,and I go to Vegas to drink,gamble and relax.The table limits are much higher on the strip,and the stats tell you the payout is generally considerably lower on machines.It truly depends on what you go to Las Vegas for.Downtown is more like the Las Vegas I like.The El Cortez,specifically,is my favorite.The piano bar is teriffic,and cheap.Low limit games abound.The food is good in the cafe,and wonderful in the steak house.The tower rooms are considered by many to be the best value in town-clean,quiet,and comfortable with great bedding.Air conditioning is great,water is hot.Service,as is the case in all of Las Vegas in my opinion,depends on your attitude as much as anything else.Take the initiative to be friendly,and it will usually be returned.The Elco is truly the last bit of Vegas left in that is not owned by a big corporation.The owner,the legendary Jackie Gaughan,lives on the property.He is regularly seen on the property,and plays poker nightly.A gentleman.Now one final note.Before long,you militant non-smokers will win Las Vegas and smoking will be banned on the casino floor and in the casino bars.Maybe it will happen this year,maybe next,it may be 5 or even 10 years.For now,however,don't come to Downtown Vegas and be offended by me sitting at the machine next to you smoking a Camel and drinking a glass of whiskey.The downtown casinos are smaller,and many of those who frequent them smoke-for now,at least,them's the facts.We have non-smokers in our group,but they are not the type who think that a whiff of smoke will cause them to immediately fall dead.In summary,I hope my comments are not considered to be smart-assed,I am just using my experiences to hopefully help others to make the right choices to make their trip great.	
Jan 21 2008 	Three days at the ElCo	We stayed at the El Cortez Jan 17-20, returned yesterday. Three of us traveling together were given a corner room on the 8th floor- it was enormous and the beds were quite comfortable. Although it's a 'non-smoking' room, the smell of smoke in and around the room is overwhelming- both 'old' smoke smell from the carpets, hallways, etc., as well as fresh smoke that seemed to come in through the ventilation system. Checkin was fine- the bellman, William, was super helpful. Food was OK- actually Careful Kitty's is pretty good. The buffet, both the breakfast and the Chinese buffet later were fine, not outstanding, but fine.Housekeeping left quite a bit to be desired, however. All that was done each day was to make the beds and change towels- no straightening up was done by staff. In fact, a dress I'd left on my bed was wadded up and left on the nightstand- I found that odd, and tipped accordingly the next day.Slots were loose- I won/lost several hundred over the course of a day. Remember to cash out when you're ahead! They do have $5 single-deck blackjack, which is where I spent most of my gaming time. Did OK, so nothing to complain about.Definitely a locals place- the only thing I found disturbing was a couple who were trying to take turns gambling with a young child standing just barely off the gaming floor. Security told them several times that they needed to take the child off the floor, but they got rather hostile and belligerent.In all, it's an Ok place to stay, provided you have modest expectations.	
Jan 17 2008 	Good room stinky lobby	We booked this hotel via travelworm.com for $60/nt for two nights on Dec 28-29. We got a two-queen-bed Tower Room above the garage. The room is big, the beds and sheets are clean, but the bathroom is small. It's a smoking room, but we felt comfortable and didn't sense any bad smell (we're not smoking persons). It's located in LV downtown, two blocks from Fremont Experience, and about 5-10 minute drive to the strip. They also have free parking lots, but no free internet. So far, everything is good as we spent most the times out of town and just needed a place to sleep. However, the lobby/casino area is very stinky with smoke. It's so stinky that we didn't even care to use their free $20 gambling coupon as we had to run into the lift every time we had to pass this area. Fortunately, we rent a car and could access the lift from parking lot.Overall, it's good value hotel for budget-minded travelers. If you need an up-scale hotel, it may not suit you.	
Jan 16 2008 	Would stay again	After reading some of the negatve reviews on the El, my husband and I were a little hesitant to stay here, but didn't have a choice as this was one of those free trips. Having said that, I was pleasantly surprised. When we arrived, the gentleman checking us in asked if we were smokers, and we told him no. He said that he had upgraded us to a king non-smoking room at no additional charge. We stayed in what I would call the old part of the hotel. The room was clean (and I have a thing about that) and well supplied (the bag of goodies that others have referred to) other than the fact that there was no hair dryer. I had checked the hotel out online though and knew to bring my own, so no problem there. The front desk workers were very nice as was most of the staff I dealt with. We received our &quot;fun book&quot; of coupons after check-in. It contained things from a complimentary drink to $5.00 slot play and $5.00 table play. The room was good size with a sitting area. The bathroom was just a tad small, but doable. The water was hot . The best part though was the bed. The mattress and pillows were great (I have a thing about that too.) I slept great. The first day we ordered room service for breakfast. The food was good. However, they did not provide any salt and I find that to be a necessity. We did not receive any comps as others have talked about for the dinner at the casino, so after looking at Roberta's prices, we opted to eat at Fritzgeralds (a short walk from the hotel). They have some great specials (but watch for the times). We took other's advice from this website and used the Duece bus to get to the strip -- they are nice, clean, double decker buses and a great deal at $5.00 per person for a 24 hour pass. Never had a problem walking to and from the bus or the Freemont Street Experience (I recommend seeing this). Okay, you've heard the good, now the other side of the coin. I really only had two complaints: As others have stated, even our non-smoking room was a little smoky, but not unbearable. Two, when I used my complimentary drink coupon, I asked for a Crown and Coke. The bartender told me that he couldn't do that for free as Crown was top shelf and asked if I would settle for a Jack and Coke. Didn't quite think that was right. But all in all, I would do it again.	
Jan 12 2008 	Tower Room = Huge!	We were rush and had to pick El Cortez coz it's farther from the stripe. it was around the thanksgiving and we paid $100 a night. we had the Tower Room and 2 queen beds, this is the biggest room i ever stayed in with this rate.it is a old hotel, the lobby stinks badly (would be better if you are a smoking person), we had to run to the elevator so we dont have to stay in the lobby for 2 more sec. once you went up, air is good. Surrounding area is not pretty at all but we just need a room and bed to stay. i like the bathroom, the beds were nice. heater is HOT! i like the old classical style of the room. during my stay, they offer 2 free nights in dec when you stay 2 nights in Nov. was a great deal, we got the coupon but didn't have time to return.	
Dec 29 2007 	Horrible service and all smoking rooms	Booked a reservation through a Vegas package website and ended up at the El Cortez. My wife reacts to smoke so we called the Vegas website to make sure we got a no-smoking room and we had selected that non-smoking option on the reservation booking. It was also printed non-smoking room on our confirmation so we thought no problem.Upon arriving at El Cortez hotel for check-in we found the non-smoking request is only a 'request' and ALL their rooms were smoking!!! Appartently you can pay (much) more for the deluxe rooms/suites which are more smoke-free but everything else is smoking. The hotel service was terrible and we ended up cancelling the room and finding another hotel on our own which was far superior and cheaper. Everything was dirty and yellowish brown from all the smoke throughout the hotel and casino area.I would NEVER return to this hotel. They appeared sneaky in trapping you into booking and then hoping you have no choice upon arrival. That was my impression at front desk too, they had clearly been through this before. I don't mind hotels only offering smoking rooms (probably better business for them) but IMO if you request non-smoking room and they can't accomidate they should not book the reservation!! Appartently the hotel allows/advertises on the various websites to book reservations under 'non-smoking' even when they don't have the rooms and then tell you it is only a request not binding!!! Ridiculous and sneaky, it means they are hungry for business and I don't think such practice should be rewarded.	
Dec 19 2007 	Hmmm...this one's tough	I had a two day in Vegas that I needed to plug with a cheaper stay. It was amazing that, on those travel web sites, the prices are truly moving targets. I didn't move fast enough to get some newer properties on either side of the Strip, so old tired downtown LV it was.First and foremost, the price was absolutely fantastic for a decent hotel. The El Cortez was probably a grand dame in its day. It is now in a questionable area awaiting revelopment, so the overall scheme of things is really frayed and tacky but, for the price, it is doable. Just park your car in the garage (which has security at all times) and use your room...and, if you are a casino or food bargain monger, then you can partake in that too.The furnishings of the room were ornate and comfortable. I slept well. The bathroom was fine. For the bargain price, the accommodations were totally acceptable and secure.In conclusion, if you like/tolerate old downtown Las Vegas, then this is definitely doable. If you are looking for a place to sleep that's fairly nice for a bargain price, this is definitely doable. If you want the hotel stay to be part of a memorable Las Vegas experience, then this is NOT the place for you.	
Dec 10 2007 	What A Pleasant Surprise!	This hotel gets so much controversy that I just had to try it for curiosity sake. On a recent 5 night stay in Vegas, I chose to stay at El Cortez my last night, December 2nd and booked a tower room since these are advertised as the nicest. Hesitant, yes, but boy was I surprised when I entered the room. Room was large with a small separate sitting room with a loveseat. The carpet was new and the furniture also appeared to be new and it didn't look like the cheap pressboard stuff either. The bathroom is small, reminds me of the bathrooms in the Gold Coast. My only complaint is that the tub had film on it and obviously could have used a better cleaning.I enjoyed the casino and the bj dealers were very nice. Good security around the hotel especially at the entrances and valet parking very attentive. Unfortunately, I didn't get a chance to eat at any of the restaurants.Would I stay here again, you betcha!	
Dec 4 2007 	Will never return	I stayed at the El Cortez for two nights. I booked online through travelworm.com. I paid extra to be in a Tower Room as the reviews said it was newer and slightly larger room. When I got to my room it didn't appear to be correct but I know the pictures online aren't always correct. It wasn't until the next day that I found out that they stuck me in a pavillion room instead of the tower room.The pavillion rooms are located outside. The walls are fairly thin. At one point during the night we could hear a man and woman arguing about how much she was supposed to get paid. We tried the cafe downstairs the service was horrible. It took an hour just to have breakfast and 15 to 20 mins of that was waiting for our order to come out. And besides that later that day I got sick from what had to have been the eggs I had ordered.If I wanted this kind of experience I would have stayed at the Motel 8 next door. The only good thing I can say is that the room appeared to be clean but who knows.	
Nov 28 2007 	El Cortez is the place to stay	I won't say that I am a seasoned Vegas traveler but have stayed in my share of seedy places. Unfortunately, it seems the negative comments garner more attention. I admit that I was holding my breath before checking in to the hotel. Check-in was a breeze for us. I was hoping for an upgrade to a tower room but I guess I didn't use the right approach. No matter. We were in a pavillion room and that suited us just fine. In fact, my sister had a tower room and there wasn't a huge difference in the size.The room was very clean and comfortable. The shower and the bathroom are small but who needs a huge room for a shower and toilet? If you are spending more time in your room instead of checking out downtown....you might want to rethink Vegas for a vacation.This isn't the place to see or be seen. It's cozy old school Vegas before Steve Wynn worked at the Golden Nugget. I mean where can you play roulette for a buck mimimum? The El isn't a huge place and you won't find it overstuffed with slot machines. The crowd is older and probably filled with more locals than tourists.Security- We walked in and out of the Cortez numerous times and I never felt like I had to look over my shoulder. Most of the foot traffic was to and fro to Fremont Street and to the Deuce bus stop. I think we were panhandled twice in four days .. that happened near the Walgreens near the Neon museum. The security guys were always outside and visible from both sides of the casino. As a side note: I recommend the Mamacita's mexican restaurant just across from the hotel.. Great food with Cuban and Mexican choices. The small party store (next door) is great for a paper , a soda, or any type of novelty purchases. The owner is a very nice guy.The hidden gem is the Deuce bus. 2 dollars one way to the Strip or go head and get the 5 dollar pass for 24 hours. The Deuce stop is directly across the street from the Fremont Street sign.I'll definitely be using the El as home base in the future. It makes no sense to dole out money that could be used for say... I dont know.. Gambling?Two more things.. Al Stokes is the slot manager.. Terrific guy! He went out of his way to make sure that our group had a blast.. Thanks Al! ( BTW you have to say you are &quot;stoked&quot; to meet him lol)The drink service can be slow at times. You are at the mercy of the section you happen to be in. We had a server that was sort of huffy after we complained. I can't say I was pleased with the final resolution ( a drink) but that was an isolated incident. See for yourself.. We had a blast...	
Nov 26 2007 	SeedyScaryCraphole of a place!	Maybe this was cool back in the day but not anymore! The rooms are falling apart. I saw an elderly man get beat up literally outside of the main entrance. I am not that picky of a person but safety is everything to me and I appreciate clean rooms which you will not find here! This is a seedy hotel in the questionable part of Las Vegas.	
Nov 10 2007 	Dysfunctional reservation system but still a great value and fun hotel	I had doubts about the El Cortez, but wanted a cheap downtown Las Vegas room for one night, so took a chance, and I was very pleased. Access from the interstate was easy, and my weeknight checkin quick and efficient.The El Cortez is possibly the oldest hotel in downtown Las Vegas, and as such is an architectural hodgepodge. The vintage rooms are original rooms from the '40s located directly over the casino, accessible by stair, but not by elevator. The pavillion rooms are on the top floor of the parking ramp which stands next to the original hotel. If one parks near the elevator, these rooms are relatively close to one's auto. The tower rooms are in a separate tower added on to the old hotel.It is a long hike from the parking ramp elevator to registration. I suggest motorists staying in pavillion rooms who choose not to use valet parking leave their luggage in their car, register, then return for their luggage instead of schlepping it with them to the registration desk.I stayed in a pavillion room, which was on the small side, and like all Las Vegas hotels in this price range had nothing in the way of amenities such as coffee, fridge, etc., the idea being that one should be gambliing instead of staying in one's room. The El Cortez casino is a grind joint where they don't expect high rollers, so no room safe. I found the room clean and perfectly satisfactory for a brief overnight stay with minimal time in the room. Pavillion rooms are accessed by outside walkways open to the weather. My room had a great view from the front door, but only a single window next to the front door. Think high rise motel. The pavillion walkways can seem spooky after dark, but are well lighted, monitored by multiple security cameras, and patrolled by guards.While on the subject of security, some previous reviewers complained about the unsafe location. Apparently they think Las Vegas is an urban Disneyland solely for their pleasure, and that all non-tourists should be banished to gulags. I found the area between the El Cortez and the Fremont Street mall to be well illuminated and patrolled. The local (and perfectly innocuous) downtown residents were outnumbered by middle aged tourist couples in stretch pants.I ate in the Chinese buffet; with the $5 discount coupon supplied upon checkin the price was $4. Nothing spectacular, but good value and a pleasant meal. I had a large full breakfast in the coffee shop for the graveyard special rate of $4. Good food, good service.My only complaint is the registration system. I phoned the hotel and was put on hold for ten minutes. After a couple such sessions I gave up and booked through priceline.com for under $36 total for a week night room. Apparently this is the norm--I just finished making another reservation at the El Cortez. The hotel website was down, and I spent five minutes on hold before reaching the reservations clerk--after previously being disconnected--only to be told I couldn't stay for Friday only, that I had to stay Saturday as well. I thanked them, rang off, then booked a Friday night only room on i4Vegas.com for under $65 total. If I'd planned farther ahead I might have gotten a better price, but since my reservation was only three weeks in advance, I find the weekend price increase reasonable.I think the El Cortez is a great value with a touch of oldtime Las Vegas ambience. Don't let their flaky reservation system discourage you if this is the sort of place which appeals to you.	
Nov 7 2007 	Best Value Downtown	If you are looking for a super clean comfortable room then this is theplace for you. The tower rooms are huge and beautiful. It is not superfancy but offers an old time feeling. It is like jumping back in time.You might be greeted with a goody bag of deoderant,soaps, facial scrubs, body and bath products, toothpaste,shampoo, razors (good ones at that) and even aftershave. We had these in our hotel room both times that we stayed during the month.The food is pretty good in the cafe that stays open all night. They have very good soups and steaks there. You will be treated like you are family at the buffet and the cafe.You will really appreciate the front desk check in for they are some of the nicest people around. They will make sure that you are comfortable during your stay. They really try hard.The comps are good if you remember to use your card during play. The comp staff is quick and very nice. They will see to it that you get what you have comming for using the card.The casino has some of my favorite old 9 line slot machines as well as the new ones. You can play pennies, nickles and dimes on most of them. They have a great variety.If you are worried about being in a shady neighborhood, don't be! There is security all around the building, in the parking ramp, and they can watch you walk a block down to Freemont Street. You will be glad to return to your quiet hotel room after all of the noise in the street. You are most likely the safest that you will be since securityis always watching over you.Yes, there are a few charactors that roam in and out of the casino but secuity has you covered. Watch your purse and wallet as you wouldwalking down the street anyway.El Cortz will wrap you up in white fluffy towels and will offer a comfortable night of quiet sleep. It is truely the best downtown.	
Nov 2 2007 	great value hotel	I had a hard time finding a decently priced place to stay, but found this place on a web site. price was excellent, $40 a night for 4 week nights. I paid for a pavillion room but was upgraded to a tower room since the pavillions were overbooked. As others have said, this is a decent hotel but nowhere near as nice as strip hotels. comparable to the general downtown hotels like lvc, fitz and plaza. only problem was that it was away from the fremont street experience. a block away from the neonopolis so at least 2 -3 blocks from the general action downtown. there was a security guard at the corner of the hotel and fremont street, a guard is there 24/7. another 24/7 guard in the back by the parking entrance. The guard in front looks down fremont street to make sure that people are safe walking down that block to the el co. lots of construction going on, a condo being built right across the street so should provide more safety with the additional foot action there. My first night there I stayed in a 2nd floor room. had a problem as I smelled cigarette smoke while sleeping. the next day I asked for a n/s room but was told the room was n/s already. they moved me up to a 12th floor room (great!) with an awesome view of the strip. as someone else said, there was a lot of noise from the club on the next block that lasted until 2 am but the a/c drowned out most of the noise. I got what I paid for, a decent, cheap safe place to stay. They provided a nice quattro razor and soaps and shampoo in addition to mouthwash, moisturizer and some cleansing pads. they also offered a coupon book with $5 cashback on machines, matching $10 play at bj, $5 off on meals (when signing up for their player's card). generally, nice place to stay, casino is so-so, food was okay and rooms in the tower were decent size, could fit 4 comfortably.	
Oct 28 2007 	Good deal for the money	If you are use to staying on the strip at the big casino's, then thisplace isn't for you. However, if you stay at places, like Circus Circus, Fitgerald's, then this place represents an excellent value. I stayed in the Towers, which I would recommend. The room was clean, bed was really nice and pretty big size. Bathroom was small and water pressure just average. One thing to keepin mind is noise, I was there Saturday night, and you can hear the loud music from the clubs which lasted until 1:30 AM.The good news is even though downtown, they are located very close to the Deuce bus stop which you can take to the strip. Also, I found the staff to be pretty friendly, however, didn't gamble there, so not sure how the rest of the staff is.Overall, for what I paid on a weekend, which was very little comparedto the strip, I am pretty satisfied with what I got. Myself, I would normally go for a nice casino on the strip if not a huge difference, but if there is a big price difference, I think this is a reasonable alternative that someone can consider if you are just looking for a clean place to crash and just sleep. I think the key thing is remember that you are paying very little in comparison to other casino's, and I think they do a very good job for what you would expect at that price. So good going El Cortez!	
Oct 28 2007 	Pavillon Rooms - Read Important Advice	Stayed in a Pavillon room for several nights.IMPORTANT ADVICE: Do not accept a room numbered in the 5502 to 5508 range. These rooms are located near the elevators, the floors are tile, the walls and ceilings are concrete, the sound echoes VERY LOUDLY. Being Vegas, this is an issue, as people are going into and out of their rooms at all hours. People engage in loud conversations waiting for elevator. Rolling luggage makes a lot of noise being pulled over the floor tiles. If your near the elevators (as I was), you'll hear all of it.GOOD THINGS:1. Price. Got a good price on line, excellent value.2. Air conditioning and heat (central) worked very well.3. Bed very comfortable. Good quality soap provided, and they also provided a razor, mouthwash, moisturizer, shampoo. 4. Free parking. Security constantly patrols parking garage.BAD THINGS:1. Room door, and bathroom door, are heavy industrial grade doors, impossible to close quietly. You'll hear your neighbors open and close their doors.2. Cable TV featured a very limited selection of stations, notably no Weather Channel. I consider not having the weather channel a big omission, considering your on vacation and you want to know what is going on with the weather.3. Provided shampoo was really bad quality. I had my own, so not a big deal.OTHER COMMENTS:1. Hotel staff is not excellent - not bad, but they certainly could be a little more friendly. Would not play Roulette or other tables at the hotel, gaming staff is surly.2. Hotel Food: Chinese Buffet is mediocre. Kitty's coffee shop is a quality shop. Note the breakfast buffet costs an extra $2 on weekends.3. The Pavillon Rooms all have 2 Queen beds, and are good for up to 2 people. Too small for more than 2, in my opinion.4. Excellent access to Fremont street. Felt safe doing the walk at all times. Bus stops to catch bus (The Deuce) to and from Strip are conveniently located. Note this bus takes a good 20 minutes to get to/from the strip. The bus drivers can be cranky.5. The room is not immaculate. The bathtub needed to be regrouted. The wood furniture had many little dents and scratches. Not a problem for me, but if your looking for new and pristine, this is not the hotel for you.	
Oct 23 2007	More than I expected	My daughter and I stayed here from October 17-21. I had booked a pavillion room. When we arrived I found we had been upgraded to a tower room. The view from our room on the seventh floor was of the mountains soaring in the distance. We ate at two of the restaurants and the food was great. The Chinese buffet was exceptional,and the staff treated us like royality.The servings in Miss Kitty's were more than we could eat. The staff , from the desk clerk to the bell man to the security guards were polite and helpful. I can't say enough good thing about El Cortez. We would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to visit Las Vegas. It was refreshing to stay in this area away from the noise and all the too bright lights on the strip. Plenty of shopping and eating places within walking distance.Way to go El Cortez.	
Oct 10 2007 	Got what expected	Got two rooms for $49 each. It is smokey downstairs and on some of the lower floors you can smell it. It was a good way to ease into the Vegas style, where you could be overwhelmed on the strip. Cheap and open tables could always be found. People say that is in the dodgy part of downtown, but i dont think that at all. Never felt that way at any time walking around at night. They have a security guard right on the corner as well. Just one block from the Freemont Street Experience. If you want to save a few bucks while staying downtown I would recommend here.	
Sep 18 2007 	Good deal for the price	I was looking for a decent hotel on or near Fremont Street for a cheap weekend. The El Cortez was the lowest priced hotel that fit the bill. I had gambled at EC several years back and remember it as a low-roller casino in a not-so-great area, so I wasn't thrilled. But I read the reviews here and they seemed to be overall positive. I'm of the opinion that a hotel rooms is just a place to clean up and sleep, so as long as it's not dirty, it's fine with me. So I decided to give it a try.I booked a Pavilion Room (much nicer than the super cheap Vintage rooms from what I had read) for $50/night Thurs-Sun. When I arrived I first noticed that the area the hotel is located appears to be much nicer than I remembered (with new condos being built nearby), and the casino itself was quite nice and much more upscale than I recall. Once I checked in, I was happy to find I was upgraded to a tower room. The only downside was that it was a smoking room (I had requested non-smoking), but there was not an overwhelming odor so it didn't bother me.Our room was on the 9th floor and had a direct view of the Strip (well as much as you can see looking straight down Las Vegas Blvd) which was really cool. The room itself is bigger than some others I have stayed in in Vegas. It had two queen beds, plus a writing desk and small couch. The decor was nothing outstanding but nice enough, and not terribly old looking. Beds were very comfy and the pillows and bedding was soft, although the outer bed cover had a couple of cigarette burns.There was a decent sized sink area with a separate small bathroom/shower area. The shower was fine to use, but very low! I'm 6'3&quot; and I had maybe 3&quot; of clearance above my head, and the shower head was about chin level for me. But the water pressure was good and it did the job. One complaint was that the toilet was running all night. As long as I shut the bathroom door it wasn't an annoyance, but it's something that should be fixed (especially with a drought in Vegas!).The only other notable thing to complain about was a rattling A/C panel on the roof. I tried to stop the rattling with no success but eventually I got used to it. This, and the toilet running were obviously problems with just the one room and not enough to condemn the place overall. In fact, I'd stay here again in a second. I've stayed at the Vegas Club three times and would choose the EC everytime instead. I redeemed a few coupons from the good funbook, but I hardly gambled at all this trip (although the EC is known for loose slots and low limits).Overall, I was happy with my stay and would recommend the EC for a low cost but comfortable stay.	
Aug 26 2007 	A Perfect Place to Vacation	I stayed 7 nights in the El Cortez. I honestly cannot find anything bad to say ! I booked through their website. It was $30 during the week and $53 on the weekend for a pavillion room. The room was nice and clean and the best bargin in LV in my opinion. Be sure and request fun book coupons a couple of times by email before you go. They give you $5 credit on slots (every 14 days) and $5 dining credit in each book. Buy an American casino guide book on the net thru Amazon etc. and tell them when you book the room you have a coupon and you get one night free. Kitty's diner in the hotel has good food at a resonable price and with the $5 coupon it's really a good deal. The hotel is only a 2 minute walk to the bus stop to the strip. The bus stop is right on Freemont street. The new double decker busses are great and only $5 for 24 hours to go anywhere. Don't believe the reviews that say it's a bad area. They have a securiy guard all day and I think until midnight on the corner by the hotel and of course there are security guards on bikes all over the area. I used to stay at the Stratosphere but this is even a better deal. Sign up for the free shuttle back to the airport when you check in. This hotel is where I'm staying from now on.	
Aug 26 2007 	Hotel reasonably clean	I have stayed at the hotel from: Aug. 14-21, 2007.We were 3 people staying in the room. My firstimpression is that the room was a pretty decentsize for 2 queen beds (PAVILION 2 QUEENS). The Bathroom was okay in cleanness &amp; was small...basically you open the door &amp; the toilet is on theright &amp; the bath tub is really close to the toilet. We didn't have any problems with the hotel employees. The only discomfort we had was that we were there for oneweek &amp; they didn't have a coffee pot for our room.Please note: there is no charge for a refrigerator,coffee pot, ironing board with iron, and hair dryer.I enjoyed the short walking distance to the busstop &amp; the Fremont experience. I've been several hotelsin Las Vegas for business, and I have had a couple ofbad experiences, though this hotel was okay... Now, I cannot comment on the older part of the hotel that has notgone through renovation. Will keep this hotel in mindon my next business trip.	
Aug 24 2007 	What a dump and the food was pig slop	We will never ever go back to the El Cortez, a real dump. The food is pure pig slop and the management are thugs in cheap suits. We will pay more next time and stay on the strip. The El Cortez is in a dangerous area and dangerous people wander in and out of the casino at all times. What a nightmare .	
Aug 21 2007	Las VEgas Trip Report	There were two underagers with me this time, Aug 5-8, but old enough to drop off at Tournament of Kings, which of course they loved, so I could stop by Bally's for the M&amp;G. Hiya! As we mentioned at the M&amp;G, my first impression coming up the strip was YUCK! Not what I wanted to see or experience coming into my faorite get away place let me tell you. I could not believe the cranes and construction and holes in the scenery. I could stay home and see that. And what is going up? the Wynn is elegant but it's not what I want to see a lot of in Las Vegas. Thank God for Downtown. We stayed at the El Cortez, clean, quiet, renovating and big enough for the 3 girls and their assorted foo-foo. Right outside there were 3 old/new neon pieces being installed with a 4th on the way. WHEE!! I love old school. The Freemont East sign was up and the stores were being spiffed up inside and out. There was no longer the &quot;questionable&quot; dark block between Cortez and Freemont St. Experience. And for the first time we noticed a significant amount of police and security presence. Squad cars, bikes, on foot, on corners, in stores, they were everywhere. And they were not afraid to look you in the eye and acknowledge you or anyone else in the area. There is rowdy fun and rowdy up-to-no-good. They'll keep it the first. I'm going back on my own in Sept, wheeha!, so I can do more of MY stuff, fountains, Slots o Fun, (love the sound of the coins, told you I was old school) Laughlin and many many margaritas. ;~)	
Aug 11 2007 	Wow better then i ever expected	I picked the hotel on the price and was very surprised on what a nice room it was, we stayed in the tower and from the looks everything in there looked newly decorated! The beds were very comfortable the room had lots of space with a nice sitting area the shower had plenty of water pressure (big plus) and everything was nice new and clean! Only complaint I have is the lack of signs in the casino, thank goodness I was more sober then most trips to Vegas this time or might have never found my back to my nice clean comfy room!	
Jul 28 2007 	Just a clean Place to sleep	This place is not really nice or does not even have stylish decor, but if you are looking for a CHEEP and clean place to stay, this is great. The AC worked really good, which is really imortant for July. The Bathroom is probably the original one, but hey who cares. I was just there to sleep for a few hours and and clean up after a long night partyin'.Hey a coool club down the street is The Griffin. It is a great place to stop by on the way out for the night.	
Jul 22 2007	El Cortez es El Perfecto!	I had the pleasure of vacationing to Las Vegas, Nevada during the middle of July 2007. Originally I considered staying on the strip at one of the more popular Vegas hotels such as Bally's or the Wynn. However, after speaking with a friend who frequently travels to VegasI was set on staying downtown to avoid the crowds and reap the gambling profits. He told me about a little known hole in the wall family run operation called the El Cortez hotel and casino.At first I was skeptical, particulary after reading the long list of bad reviews here on trip advisor. My friend encouraged me to stay at the El Cortez and check out Orbitz for a great deal on the trip. Sure enough, I found a 5 day, 5 night plus airfare package from Hartford, CT for $315. I was amazed at the deal and couldn't pass it up. I figured that even if the place was a total dump the vacation was still a steal.I arrived at the El Cortez on Sunday afternoon. It isn't in the most visually pleasing neighborhood, but as soon as you enter the hotel a very pleasent (and gorgeous) hostess in there to greet you and answer any questions. There was a small trash can fire that had just been put out when I arrived so it did smell a little like burning plastic. Check in was a breeze and I promptly made my way up to my room. My room was very spacious and clean with two queen beds, a 36-inch plasma tv, and a newly renovated bathroom. The bathroom was generallysmall, but had plenty of mirrors and granite counter tops. About halfof the hotel has been renovated so make sure to specify that you wanta renovated room when you arrive. There is no extra cost. The sportsbook is very tastefully done with a pleasent staff. There are about six 50-inch plasmas and quite a few smaller plasmas as well. The sportsbook is not as elaborate as the Strip books, but the leather seats are incredibly comfortable and the odds are actually better than most strip sportsbooks.Unfortunately, the slot machines are still coin operated. The table games however are wonderful. It was never crowded and the dealers seemed genuinely happy when I won. I won over 500 dollars at the blackjack table during my stay. I even played a few hands with Jim, the owned and operator of the El Cortez. He is a big drinker but a nice guy.The Chinese buffet was excellent. It rivaled any Chinese buffet I have been to in Vegas. I also tried out there sit down restuarant, which is immaculate and reasonably priced. I had a better meal there for 30 bucks than the 150 i spent on a 7 course meal at the Wynn during the week.I cannot say enough about the El Cortez. It was truly a pleasure to stay downtown at this hotel. I will be back in December. Please don'thesitate to take advantage of this hotel and the dirt cheap deals that can be found on Orbitz, Travelocity, Expedia, etc. Viva LAS VEGAS!!!	
Jul 17 2007 	Wow -- The El Cortez is really nice!!!	I spent 3-days in June at the El Cortez and found the property and the personnel to be way more than I expected. My room was one of the Pavilion rooms above the garage so it was a great value and very clean. Bed was comfy and the shower was refreshing.There were no issues walking from the El Cortez to LV Blvd to catch the 'Duece' or Fremont Street Experience. That area is under major improvement, well-lit, and monitored/patrolled -- so you feel safe. Just use common sense as you would anywhere else.I ate at all the restaurants there and would rate the food much above average and a great value for your money.The gaming was fun. I played mostly BJ and video poker. Don't forget to use the coupons in the Fun Book. I won with the $10 match play coupon and there was a special deal where they gave me $20 on my player's card.They also gave me a 2 Free Nights coupon so I am going back to the El Cortez for 6 nights in August. Good Luck!!!	
Jul 11 2007 	I got a really really good deal!!!	I have stayed in Las Vegas many many times, and I like to stay at the Lady Luck hotel downtown, Unfortuntaly that is now closed so I had to pick some place else. I choose the El Cortez because I found a mistake on the internet. I stayed at the El Cortez from June 30th - July 5th 2007, and my entire stay was only $55.20. We had a vintage room , only one flight of stairs. not bad. The room was very clean , but small only one queen bed. The bathroom was fine, but no vanity. Water pressure was a little weak , but it did the job. The first night the shower door fell off the track. I told the front desk the next morning and it was fixed right away. the pillows were a little thin asked for extra no problem, asked for an extra blanket the room was a little chilly, No problem getting the blanket. They must pump air freshner into the casino because it always smelled like colone. if your senative to that you might want to stay elsewhere. The walk to the Fremont Street Experience was never any trouble. always felt safe even late at night. The breakfast buffet was a little skimpy but the price was right $5.95 If you use the $5.00 meal coupon in the fun book it was a steal. All in all it was a nice stay, and as I said I got a really good deal. I was not expecting much for what I paid. I was very pleased with what I received. On their web site they show you pictures of the rooms and casino , and they look the same including the bed spread. I would stay here again.	
Jul 7 2007	The El Cortez is Fine	My first Vegas hotel doubled its rate for Friday and Saturday, so I moved to the El Cortez on Friday, June 29, for the second half of my trip. I stayed five nights. Prepaid $252 through Orbitz, which included all taxes. (I suspect you could do better if you poked around the Internet, but this was as good a rate as the El Cortez Web site offered, so I took it.) I checked in around 6 p.m.; there was no wait, and they had my paid reservation. They put a $50 hold on a credit card for incidentals, which was never used.My room was in the tower, seventh floor. It was clean and quiet. The fixtures are older, but everything worked. Two queen beds, fairly firm. There was enough soap, wash cloths, shampoo, and towels. The sheets and towels were good quality, not super-plush or super-high-thread count. Good water flow from the shower head; the water was hotter at off-peak hours, like early morning or early evening, than at mid-morning, but it was never a real issue. The air conditioner was controlled by an older thermostat. The room got cold when I wanted it cold. I needed a wake-up call one morning and got one, on time, from a live operator.I didn't gamble in the casino except to use my $5 match play coupon in blackjack and for a little poker. The room is fairly smoky, if that bothers you. Clientele is older and of moderate means. &quot;Jackie&quot; Gaughan, the hotel owner, was playing poker one morning.I used the parking garage. There was a guard posted at the entrance or on the sidewalk nearby. Valet is available. The area around the El Cortez is being spruced up. There is a condo tower going up next door, and the section of Fremont Street leading to the main downtown casino district was landscaped and a Vegas sign added in a center island while I was there. The two blocks it takes to get from the El Cortez to the other Fremont Street casinos are not great, but the warnings I had heard were overblown.I ate breakfast at Careful Kitty's, the El Co coffee shop, with the $5 voucher in their coupon book. French toast and coffee; nothing special, but fine. Service was good.It's only about 10 minutes to the Strip if you take L.V. Boulevard to Charleston to I-15 South.For a single person with a car, or older people planning to gamble here, this is a good choice. The staff was friendly and competent. The rooms are older but clean. I would definitely stay here again.	
Jun 13 2007 	It's not that great but it's bad as well.	We booked from tripres for our first ever trip to vegas on 5th June. We select first night to this hotel as we want to be in freemont street for a night so we can expore that part of the vegas. when we reached the hotel at arround 10.30pm, hotel was overbooked in the room category we were in. So straight forward, they gave us upgraded room for the same price and added bonus free breakfast coupen for two + $10 casino coupen without even asking from us. Good deal to start with.Hotel is kind of older facility, you can tell by look. Rooms are bigger and nicer. Casino in hotel is very small. The whole area is under construction so we were disappointed on our first night ever in vegas. Morning breakfast is ok. Not a great one but it's fine compare to MCD or any other fastfood places. No fresh fruits. All canned fruits. Eggs and waffles are good. Good choices.Hotel crowd is more like 50+ so I would not suggest any younger crowd. Infect I would not stay again in that whole area. The way to go is strip hotel. I paid $40 a night and at arround same rate I stay's at Excalibur next night. So it's far better deal than Cortez for sure. Another funny thing is, owner of the hotel stays on top floor that we came to know as he was with us in the elevator next morning. That said, seems like it is totally family run hotel. Not like those bigger houses on the strip. Overall, it is ok. Not worth trying again. We paid $40 and got back $15 breakfast + $10 casino credit + 2 free drinks (that's free anyway when you play) + $10 planet holleywood food voucher(from tripres.com). So overall it is a worth deal like staying for a free.	
Jun 11 2007 	Great atmosphere and a nice room.	Was nice. I stayed from June 04 to June 09 at the Ogden House which is a 5 storey motel owned by the El Cortez, across the street behind the hotel (Ogden Ave) - takes less than a minute to walk across the street to the motel from the lobby @ the El Cortez. Room was comfortable &amp; clean. A/C worked great. Not large - credenza style dresser, queen bed, 20&quot; TV, chair and night table. Bathroom hadplenty of counter space. Shower was great. Soap, shampoo and hand cream. Housekeeping was awesome. $25 per night, Friday night $47. Got a fun book when I checked in and another on Wednesday night because the person at the front desk who checked me in was cool! Funbook had a $5 coupon for slot play, $5 off an entree and a free gift of an El Cortez keychain with my picture on it. There were a couple of other coupons but they weren't of value to me. Check out the El Cortez website for info on the Fun Book.Toured the El Cortez office, lots of cool pictures and memorabilia including many gambling chips featuring Jackie Gaughan. All the staffat the hotel were great including the poker room boss and Tracy, one of the dealers. Saw Jackie Gaughan a few times playing poker and saidhi.Kitty's Restaurant @ the El Cortez did a good vegetarian omelet with spinach but their $3.99 graveyard special sausage and eggs was ho-hum.Enjoyed a free (with coupon) clubhouse with lots of fries inside the casino - &quot;gameside dining&quot; they call it - sat and played at a penny slot machine and they took my order, brought to me on a tv cart with everything right there. Kinda neat although without the free coupon Idoubt I'd do it again - maybe.The Slot Club Card offered free coupons (gameside dining, extra pointdays, free slot tournament - lots of wrist exercise! and $5 in free slot play) No points for the poker tables. I left with 171 points I think and was told I could get a 2 for 1 buffet.I would stay there again no problem. Right now they are offering two free nights in July or August for anybody staying at the hotel from April to June.	
May 30 2007 	El Cortez is good!	We stayed in El Cortez for May 20 to May 28. We have had a reservation in hotelclub.com and paid for it just 80 USD per three nights! The hotel is clean, the location is perfect and the staff is friendly. The hotel entrance is a beautiful casino, when we arrived at the Hotel we won a paper that needed to be changed for a discount book and 5 USD to play at the casino. We won a gift too, one key ring with our photo, so nice! The bed was confortable and the sheets and towels are clean and smell good. There's no refrigerator or microwave in the bedroom, but to eat in Vegas is very cheap, so it doesn't matter for us!	
May 23 2007 	No Pool Great Room On the way up	The place seems to be remodeled. Tower rooms are spacious, well designed and clean. Staff was courteous. There is a lot of construction around the hotel but it was a minor inconvenience. For the price we found we could take a cab to the Stratosphere pool which is way nice. Close walk to Fremont Street. We never felt unsafe outside at any time of day or night. The Casino was not as upscale and peppy as Main Street Station or the Golden Nugget but again, for the price and close walk its a great place to sleep. This is an up and coming place with the urban renewal occuring in the area. The south side has a great view of the strip skyline. Take advantage of the the low price.	
May 16 2007 	good deal	We booked through travelocity and only paid $275 each for 3 nights and roundtrip flights from Detroit. We were a little skeptical before the trip, but it turned out to be a really good deal. The hotel is not fancy but it is a good place to stay for cheap. We stayed in a tower room which costs about $10 more a night but it was definately worth it. The room was really big and there was a little sitting area with a couch and table. There was also a desk and the beds were comfortable. My only complaint about the room was that the water pressure was not good and the shower head is really low but it wasn't really a big deal.The casino is not as nice as some of the others, and at times it smelled a little strange, but it was still fun and it was nice to have really low minimums on table games. We ate at Careful Kittys and it was decent but not really good. I think it's a better idea to walk down towards Fremont St. and eat at a restaurant over there. The walk is only about 5 minutes and we felt safe walking it at all times of the night. Overall, if you are looking for a cheap but clean place to stay with a casino that is near Fremont St. than El Cortez is a great idea.	
May 8 2007 	Whatta Deal!	What a pleasant surprise! Our first vacation in 12 years, and we came to town for a big convention. While our friends were spending $200 a night on the Strip, my wife booked us online - round-trip flights from Denver and three nights @ the ElCo for less than $190.00 each. Do the math!We didn't do much except sleep &amp; shower here, but it was great place to base out of. 5th-floor tower rooms had a great view south to the Strip... the lights were beautiful. The beds were VERY comfortable, shower was fine, free valet parking across the street was very nice (and got an extra tip at the end of the week).We walked to Fremont St Exp a couple of times and always felt completely safe. Only got quietly panhandled once, and that was in the daytime. My wife said she enjoyed Fremont more than the Strip, because the Strip was overwhelming... too much to see. Plenty of cheap souveniers downtown, too ;-)Only real annoyance... $12 dollar a day wireless Internet, and I always had problems getting online.Condo construction across the street, currently remodeling the porte cochere entrance to the hotel, and Fremont St in front of the casino was being repaved/rebuilt... you could occasionally hear the construction, but it was NEVER a problem for either of us.We've told lots of friends what a great deal we got... we'd stay here again in a heartbeat... thank, ElCo, for a great stay!	
May 3 2007 	Good Budget Option	My boyfriend and I stayed at the El Cortez for two nights during our visit to Las Vegas. We decided to pay as little as possible for a hotel so we can spend the money on good seats at a Cirque du Soleil show and a tour to the Grand Canyon instead. We paid about $60 a night and got the Vintage room, which is ALL SMOKING and in the old part of the hotel. Reading other people's reviews, I feel like we overpaid for a worse room (since others who stayed at the newer tower room paid about the same and had a better experience). But the price discrepancies might be due to seasonal differences, with the beginning of summer. (Our stay was April 28-30, 2007, and the hotel was completely booked).The hotel is in downtown, away from the Strip, but we didn't mind because we rented a car. The hallways leading to the rooms were dark and smoky, but the room, thankfully, was not (although throughout the night I felt the cigarette smoke creeping in the room; but what do you expect in Vegas?). It had nice oak furniture and had a bigger TV than I expected, with basic cable. The bathroom was old, but seemed to be maintained well. Clean sheets and towels saved the day, I didn't find any hair or mysterious stains as I have before in much more expensive hotel rooms! No hair dryer but we brought our own. We walked to the Fremont Street Experience (a block away) at Midnight on a Sunday and I didn't feel unsafe at all, with security guards standing around. Fremont Street Experience was totally awesome, loved the video/audio show. There is a Walgreen and an ABC store right there underneath the Fremont Street Experience dome, selling all kinds of things you might need on a trip, like water, band-aids, etc. All the old school casinos are right there, too! Frankly, I enjoyed this part of Vegas so much more than the Strip. It was so much more easygoing! The Strip was so crowded and awful, I wasn't having fun at all there. And parents, you might want to reconsider letting your kids see the free &quot;Sirens of the TI&quot; show in front of Treasure Island. I caught the 11:30 show on a Saturday, bunch of parents brought their little kids, and I thought it was inappropriate for them considering it contained mostly adult (sexual) humor and girls dancing in thongs and bikini tops.Also, the hotel gives you a coupon book with a voucher for a free drink, $5 slot play credit, $5 off at their restaurants, etc. I thought that was nice! As for the front desk personnel, some were nice, some were not, if you care about that sort of thing. All in all, El Cortez is a good budget option.	
May 2 2007 	My favorite Vegas getaway	Myself and 3 close friends visit El Cortez at least twice a year. We started staying at ElCo 7 years ago at our travel agents recommendation. Now I wont stay anywhere else! The tower rooms are by far the nicest. Vintage and Pavillian rooms are fine but not as easy to get to. Stay away from the Odgen House across the street. If there is something you need in your room not provided they are always happy to bring it to you. (Refrigerator,Coffee pot, etc.) Sometimes the front desk staff is flaky so print your confirmation info and bring it with you.  The gambling is top notch and they treat loyal customers like royalty. After you have played a couple days go to the slot club and request a host. Your host will do just about anything you ask within reason. (Meals,rooms,tickets, etc)After the first visit we don't have to pay for our rooms anymore and I believe the only way to get a jacuzzi suite is to have it comped. Make sure to use your Jackie's club card to get comps.The slots are loose,Video poker even looser, Plenty of low denom table games, reasonable priced food (Mostly comped) and the best keno in Vegas. The dealers are usually new as others have said but they are always friendly and able to speak english well. Just keep an eye on them for mistakes. Most mistakes I have seen were in the players favor anyway.As others have said don't let the neighborhood scare you. I have never had a problem, and the area is really starting to &quot;nice up&quot;.Jackie really knows how to treat people and won't be around forever so please enjoy this landmark while you can. Jackie can usually be found in the poker room early in the morning usually wearing a trademark green tie and giving some good looking woman a hard time.Please try to visit before rising property values in the area cause the El Cortez to become another victim of implosion. The El Cortez IS Vegas in my opinion. Good Luck and tell Jackie Justin says hi!	
May 2 2007 	El Cortez: Great Value	Stayed two nights at El Cortez. It is currently under major construction/renovation as are the streets around it, so be aware of that. Keep in mind, THIS IS AN OLD HOTEL, ONE OF THE OLDEST HOTEL/CASINOS STILL STANDING IN LAS VEGAS (meaning don't expect a &quot;strip&quot; style hotel because that's not what they're selling here.We rented a car and parked in the FREE parking garage attached to the hotel. The first impression we had was of the dingy old elevator which led into a dingier part of the casino. At first, I was kind of nervous. But as we traveled through the casino to the hotel desk, I noticed that they are remodeling the casino one section at a time, so I think it will be all updated within a few months. Check-in was great. We got automatically &quot;upgraded&quot; from a pavillion room (motel-style w/ exterior doors) to a room at the top of the tower overlooking the strip. Great view. The elevator up to the tower room was much nicer than the elevator from the parking garage. Marble, brass, etc.We had a smoking room and my husband does smoke, so I can't comment on whether the room smelled smoky or not because Mr. Chimney was smoking half the time, so yes, ours did smell like smoke. :-)The room was a mix of old and new furnishings. The carpet, bedspreads, and wall hangings all seemed very new. The blankets under the bedspreads were very old and not very plush anymore. The wood furniture is solid wood but was also very old. The bathroom was very old. Peach bathtub, peach tile, etc. However, it was clean. I liked the little window in the tub. It opened and let the nice warm desert air in but no one can see in because of the placement of the window. There was TONS of water pressure in the shower. That was great.The rooms are big and even had a couch and coffee table.There was no iron/ironing board or hair dryer in the room. You can call the front desk and they will send them up to you, but if you want them, call way before you need them because I called for a hairdryer and it didn't come and I got bored of waiting and just left to go out w/ wet hair.We ate at the Careful Kitty Cafe and it was good and a good price. The location of the hotel is great. Only one block from the Fremont Street Experience and Walgreens and the Neonopolis shopping mall, etc. It was nice that its not actually ON the Fremont Street strip because I'm sure that can get noisy at night.All things considered, we had a really fun trip. I highly recommend renting a car (we got one for $12/day) and also highly recommend that if you rent a car, you bring your GPS or rent one from the car rental place because GPS is a godsend. We went all over the place with ease. I would stay at the El Cortez again in a heartbeat.	
Apr 24 2007 	El Cortez-Awesome Price Great Hotel!	We booked this hotel, expecting a no frills, budget hotel. We paid for a pavillion room above the parking garage. The room was very clean, and the sheets and pillow cases changed everyday. The room itself showed a bit of age, but we expected that because it is an older hotel. Also, the bathroom was fairly small, and had no hair dryer - but we read reviews before coming, so we brought our own hairdryer. We were very happy with the hotel, even though they were undergoing construction, and felt that it is above average for the price they we paid. The area of town is not that great, and we were warned by the taxi driver to not venture past our hotel at night, and to mainly stay by freemont street (which was about 2 blocks away). However, we did feel safe walking around-even at night. There were cameras and a security guard outside the hotel at all times.After arriving back home, I realized that if I had paid big money for a hotel on the strip, I would have been disappointed. We were only in the room long enough to sleep and shower. The rest of the time we were out sightseeing and experiencing Vegas! If we were to return to Vegas, I would not hesitate to book this hotel again!	
Apr 19 2007 	Good room at a great rate	Stayed two nights in a Tower Room. The room was very large, but its bathroom was a bit on the smallish side. The room showed a bit of age, but everything was very clean and a great place to get a quiet nights sleep. Check-in was quick and friendly. The price is right because you don't have to help pay for volcanoes, pirate shows, or giant fountains. The Fremont Street Experience and numerous other casinos are just a couple blocks away.	
Apr 11 2007	Nice rooms 	We stayed in the old wing of the hotel. Good value for downtown Las Vegas. Clean room, nice decor and god service from the staff.	
Apr 10 2007	great stay	Great stay, clean, huge rooms. Good area, cheap price! Nothing better than that if you have a car (it's 5 miles off the strip). It's got its shopping area...	
Apr 6 2007 	Truly classic old school Las Vegas charm	I stayed at the El Cortez in late March of 2007. I got a non-smoking Tower room, # 1411. At about $50.00 a night it was comparable to any standard hotel room in Downtown Las Vegas including the Golden Nuggetand I would stay at the El Cortez again..My room had a fresh, tropical decor and had a good view of the Strip and even had a small balcony. My requested king room was not available, so rather than wait, I got 2 queen beds, not a problem for me. The beds were comfortable and appeared nearly new, at least the one I used but the other was good for organizing my stuff. In general, the carpet, furniture, TV and fixtures in the room appeared nearly new and showed little wear. Furniture included 2 queen beds, a dresser with new TV, a small foldout desk, a love seat near the window with a coffee table, see the photos. Lighting was good but could have used more light over the desk. Looks like there is a data hookup near the desk. The remote for the TV died on the last day and I checked the batteries and found them original to the TV, e.g. same brand, so I knew that it was a newer TV. Sink, mirror and closet space were in an alcove separated by a door from the shower and toilet. Shower had a small window that opened onto the balcony.Water pressure was good but you stepped up in to the tub and the shower head came to about 5 feet 6 inches above the floor of the tub and anyone much over 6 feet would have trouble using it. The usual small bottles of useful stuff in the bathroom. Ample towels were softer than at the Golden Nugget. Heat and AC worked fine but thermostat seemed older and was hard to read. No fridge but one was sent up with no problem nor extra cost. No iron or ironing board, one could have been sent up but that was not an issue for me. No coffee pot nor in room safe but again not a problem, there is a coffee place near the elevators and a free safe deposit box behind the front desk.In general, the hotel is in good shape and is in the middle of a major renovation matching that of the neighborhood around it. No bugs, mystery stains nor other major issues. I ran into the owner in an elevator, he lives on the 15th floor. Nice older gent with his trademark green tie, I complimented him on the hotel and he wished me luck. Casino had a lot more table games and fewer slot machines etc. than I recall from years past. I was told they are opening it upto avoid the crowded look you can still find at the venerable GoldSpike. Weather was warm, in the 80s and I missed a pool nor can guests use the pool at the Plaza anymore since they changed owners..I watched a crane lift large air handling units onto the roof of the casino, once they were operational, I noticed a real change in the air quality inside the casino. Ate a buffet, it was ok but was not great. The Subway sandwich shop was about standard for a Subway. Fun Book was OK but not great. Enjoyed all 3 bars, do ask for the tall glass of Sam Adams at the bar near the check in desk. There is also a fancy round bar with a piano player and a more normal bar near the Fremont Street entrance. Casino/hotel security was tight, including officers watching the sidewalk outside the property. Security cameras in the hotel hallways.Stashed my bag in my friends vintage room until mine was ready, it was about as big as a small bedroom in an older house maybe 12 feet square at the most with a painted over window. Definitely go for the tower room if you can as it only costs a few dollars more but is wellworth it. In general, the area continues to improve from years past and is muchsafer than its reputation from the bad old days. Walking the streets at all hours, I was not bothered much at all, just a few panhandlers and other miscreants but no one threatening. This in now called The Entertainment District, extending east to 8th, or the parking lot of the Western Much money is going into civic improvements and there is talk of extending the Canopy down to the Western.Trendy new nightspots like the Griffin and the Beauty Bar have opened nearby. Also old standards like the Atomic Liquors, Bunkhouse Saloon and the funky old Western Casino/Hotel. A new luxury condo (I ask you, is there any other kind these days?) called Streamline Toweris going up just to the north of the El Cortez which will help to clean up the area further.Much road work going on and soon the sort of historic neon signs seen under the FSE will advance eastward. Both lead to some disturbing construction noise at all hours when the window and balcony door were open, but this is part of urban life and should be over soon.BOTTOM LINE  Although probably not for the Vegas virgin seeking the glitz of the tourist traps on the Strip, with its combination of truly classic old school Las Vegas charm and the new renovations both inside the property and the general upgrading of the surroundingarea, this is a good place to stay and I sure would stay here again.	
Apr 3 2007 	Loved it	Ok, let me tell you. This may be my most favorite hotel for under $60.00. We stayed on a Saturday night when most hotels are charging way over $100.00. I booked the room because we were only going to stay for 1 night and it was right downtown where I wanted to be. I was so surprised at just how nice the room was. I booked a deluxe room in the tower and Wow was it nice. It had a huge bed, really nice furniture, a seperate sitting area, and a huge balcony overlooking downtown vegas, the strip and the mountains. I wish we had more time to spend there. We did have the breakfast buffet in the morning and it was great. The casino is old, but the dealers and all the staff we ran into were very very nice. Dont worry about the area, All you have to do is walk across the street and you are on fremont street its that close. I love this hotel and would recommend to anyone.	
Mar 23 2007 	Not for more than one night	The hotel is old and has no insulation to block out road noise or the construction noise going on around the El Cortez. We booked from the El Cortez website where they could have posted the construction occcuring but they did not. The purchase of ear plugs helped some but not enough. We stayed for 10 nights and was exhausted by the time we checked out. Management did not appear interested in whether we were comfortable. We will not stay there again nor will we recommend it to others.	
Mar 2 2007	Good Deal	This hotel is above average for the price. We booked a regular room and were given a nice tower room instead. The facility was clean and quiet. The gambling is fun and cheap. Breakfast at Kitty's Cafe is tasty and a good deal. Don't stay here if you want all the bells and whistles but if you want a good value and like the old Vegas, this is definitely a winner.	
Feb 24 2007 	Loved it but.....	We booked a non-smoker and got a smoker BUT the room wasn't smoke-smelly, was clean, big, had a view of the strip, was well cleaned every day and if you think of the tiny bath as a big shower then this room was excellent, especially for the price. Whatever you specify when you book will go out the window when you arrive, including whether or not you want single or double beds, but I believe the above benefits outweigh the risk. Also, this is a bit of historic Downtown which those at the Bellagio etc will never see. Personally, I didn't think much of the Fremont Experience but the gambling facilities at Binions, the Fitz and the Golden Nuggett are second to none. One last IMPORTANT bit of advice.....the front desk personnel leave so often that they know nothing so ask the guys and girls who work there. For instance, wanted to rent a car for a day. Front desk said 'try the airport!' - asked someone who had worked there for a few years who said the Fitz round the corner had Enterprise Car Hire, and I got nice wheels from there. Also the front desk made a complete mess of.....toooooo boring to relate but needless to say have as little to do with the front desk as possible - just ask those who have worked there for a while.For the price this is one of the best bargains in town. Only gamble at El Cortez if you like smoke, and the poker 'room' is to be avoided, although the guy who runs it is a real character, really old school, looks and sounds like he knew Bugsy Siegal!! If they paid good money to get good people on the front desk then it would be the best.	
Feb 19 2007	Excellent stay at the El Cortez	Plaza vs El Cortez? After seeing the reviews and the recommendations.......we chose the El. 2/8-2/123pm check in time, but earlier check in was no problem.We had a great room (tower) with double queen beds on the 12th floor (Rm 1207) facing the strip. With our 2-4-1 coupon found in the American Casino Guide (a must to buy, but check the book when you receive it in case there are missing coupon pages if you buy thru Amazon or E-bay) and our meager slot play return, we payed $277.20 for 5 nights for a fantastic stay. Soda and ice machines on each floor. Don't put their Vegas tap water in a water bottle to save $ from buying high cost water on Fremont St or the strip. Tap water tastes horrid but suitable to brush your teeth with. Front desk clerks were sooo nice and very helpfull. They had lost our information on our stay, so thankfully I had brought a copy of our confirmation that was done thru their web site. I recommend that everyone print it out and bring it.We asked for a fridge, which was rolled in on a nice size cart that we were able to set up our own one cup coffee maker on top of. My husband loved that . Also the love seat with coffee table which he loved relaxing on after a long day of walking. The t.v was a bigger than what we saw in the other reviewers pictures and worked great with lots of channels. Again, nice to relax to for the short time spent in the room. Plenty of super hot water, great water pressure (even during peak usage times) and tub drained quickly. No water backed up.The bathroom and large window in the room opened up (4 inches) for ventilation. The beds were soooo comfy &amp; very clean. The curtains darkened the room so we never knew what time it was in the a.m. Housekeeping never bothered us in the morning when we had the &quot;do not disturb&quot; sign on the door. Great!!We were there 5 nights (including weekend) and thought we had the whole floor to ourselves because we only ran across two people in the hall on our last night. Very quiet rooms.The rooms (rugs, furniture, walls etc) were spotless and believe me, I checked under the mattress for the creepy-crawley things that were found, with pictures to prove it from other reviewers, in nice places like the Bellagio (mice) and the Luxor (bed bugs). Nothing to report!!! yea!!!In case you forget them, they provide shampoo, conditioner, mouthwash &amp; hand soap. I tipped Housekeeping a couple of dollars each day, which I left on the bed with a note so they would know it was for them, and left them more on our last day. Please show them your appreciation. I also left them some 2-4-1 coupons that I had leftover from other downtown buffets which I'm sure they could use because they weren't just for players with cards. We won't be back for another year so no use to us.Feeling safe in the casino and area? Yes....for sure. They had security walking around and I played slots by myself until 3am while my husband retired back to the room to sleep. They also had security on the corner of Fremont &amp; 6th Ave to watch the walkers coming back from the FSE. This is also the corner that we had to wait for our Grayline shuttle back to the airport, so we felt very safe. He actually seemed to know the regulars that were coming and going and everyone was very respectfull. We did Grayline ($14 pp) round trip because we didn't know at the time of our flight booking that the El also provides shuttles. If you use the El's shuttle, please make your rez with them as they request? They're not mind readers and need to know ahead of time of your needs to get you there in plenty of time to get thru the airports security.There's a &quot;lot&quot; of constuction going on in that area because the El is fixing up their front door entrance. The road is being torn up, I'm assuming because of the new Streamline condo's needs for bigger water/sewer lines. This shouldn't stop you for going to the El as the strip is also always seeing a lot of construction and it's just a fact of life in Vegas.The gift shop is open 24 hrs with munchies to buy to enjoy before bed. After doing that at 3am every morning, the security at the elevator got to know that I was done for the night and wished me a pleasant beddy-bye and never said &quot;don't let the bed-bugs-bite&quot;LOL. Sorry to say I can't comment on the food other than the breakfast buffet. You'll have to find those reviews with the others. The breakfast buffet is o.k. How can they mess up scrambled eggs, sausage, cinnamon rolls and coffee anyway. Our needs are just basic for the a.m........ &quot;don't stop the coffee refills!!!&quot;Plenty of different denominations on the slot machines with a lot of the old favorites and new ones. Yes.....even the penny &quot;Cashman&quot;. They were by far, looser and more available (less people) than the strip but not as loose as the &quot;Fremont Casino&quot;. One bonus round on a Fremont Cashman gave me $252. Sorry, my secret as to which one. LOL!! More hits on other machines but I won't go into them as this is a review about the El.Sorry again that I can't comment on the card tables, but other reviewers have written about them. Low bets etc.The Duece ($5 for a 24 hr pass and also good on all CAT buses if going to casinos off the strip...Rio etc) is a short one block walk from the El and FSE is a quick 2 block walk. If you ride the Duece and going to the Strip, enjoy the ride from the upper level. If you're 5'7&quot; or taller, duck your head up there because that's how low the ceiling is. We enjoyd the sick humor of watching people, especially the men, smack their heads when they reached the top of the stairs before they realized the ceiling height.....even though there's a sign stating it. Very funny! LOLI hope I covered everything that you might need to know about the El. I tried to talk about the things &quot;I&quot; might want to ask if I was going to try a new place and hopefully covered it all.Go to the El, enjoy its comfort &amp; super clean rooms, feel secure and save your $ for all of the other crazy things to see and do while in Vegas.Rocky's Hun	
Feb 12 2007 	Clean room not so safe neighborhood	We just got back from the El Cortez - our first time staying here and first time staying downtown. The hotel is going through some renovations - the sports book was fantastic. The front desk staff was nice  I had read some posts about them not being friendly or knowledgeable, but we didnt experience that. The room was nice  very clean and comfortable. We requested a non-smoking king room and that was what we received. However, the area surrounding the El was fairly undesirable. It was a two-block walk to the Fremont Experience and the first block was pretty shady. Just remember  this hotel is downtown. We live in Detroit, so were used to a shady downtown, but I was somewhat surprised by this in Vegas. I never felt unsafe, but I wouldnt walk alone, even during the day. Also, a few of the dealers at El could barely count. It was okay for short periods, but we did the majority of our gambling elsewhere. The price of the room was fantastic, so if we wanted a cheap trip, we would stay here again. I think I would have rated this higher if I realized how different downtown was from the strip. If we were staying downtown, I would recommend the El  save some money on the room, cause in Vegas there are definitely more fun ways to spend that!	
Feb 5 2007 	Roberta's has wonderful prime rib	This was my third stay at the El Cortez and it just gets better each time. The entire staff has always been wonderful to me and my friends during our stay. Roberta's has some of the best meals in Town. Very fair prices and fantastic service as well. Good gaming and very nice rooms. I look forward to my next vacation and another stop at the El Cortez.	
Jan 25 2007	What an experience	We booked this hotel because we wanted something cheap and closed to the airport (within 15 minute drive). We were using the room to catch 5-6 hours sleep before our flight left the next morning.We arrived from Hawaii at midnight and got to the hotel shortly after that, to be told that there computer systems had been down all day and they had manually check in and check out guests and that needed to set aside and wait a while before they could determine if they had any rooms available for us. My hushand threw a fit and told the girl we needed a room to catch a few hours sleep before we checked out the next morning at 6am. Finally, they gave us a room key. It was 1:00 by then - Needless to say I got 4 hours sleep that night. Room itself was just okay. THEY DO NOT HAVE A HAIR DRYER ON THE WALL - so you'll need to call housekeeping and they bring a regular one up to your room. Bathroom is very, very small compared to other hotel rooms. Bed was comfortable. Decor was a little out of date but that really didn't concern us too much.	
Jan 17 2007 	"Hidden" Treasure	If you're looking for fountains and volcanos, this isn't your hotel. Go to the Strip and spend $$$. If you're looking for a nice, clean, large (except the bathroom) room at a great price and don't need your hand held, look no further. The ElCo Tower rooms are for you.This place is a classic. Very &quot;old school&quot; with great personality. Not that it's worn and run down, it's not. In fact the property is very clean and well maintained, with great service from employees who care. One thing that impressed me when talking to the employees is many have been there for 20 or more years. (except the dealers)Ahhh the dealers. Craps is geat with low minimums, but the 21 dealers were recent grads of Joe Blow's Dealers Academy looking to refine their &quot;skills&quot; and move up to the Wynn. (Good Luck)In short. If you are looking to stay Downtown with easy access to the Duece bus and the rest of Fremont (without the noise) for a great price, (we paid $25 per night) then do yourself a favor and give the ElCo a try. You won't be disappointed.	
Dec 8 2006 	Best 2 star Hotel in town	This is the Best 2 star Hotel in las Vegas! I have stayed at most and this is above the rest! Cheap rooms, good eats, and easy comps. Large rooms with lots of nice cherrywood furniture.( not the average motel fiberboard junk) big comfortable beds. Employees glad to help without an attitude. Yes it is in a low class part of town, 1 block from the Fremont Street Expierence, but at night there is a security guard on the corner. I could not have found a better place to stay! Had a king room on the 10th floor, with view of the strip. Cost me 19.00! Look forward to going to Vegas and staying were again!!!!	
Oct 16 2006 	The best Hotel in Vegas	Hi My fiance and i stayed at the Cortez and loved it. I stayed there in the past and told her that its the place to stay. We got a room in the tower and was amazed by how big it was. The bed was soo comfy that I didnt want to get up in the morning. We got married and had our honeymoon there. We visited other Casino/Hotels on the strip and liked the bones( elevators, bathrooms, people, valet etc) more that the pricy ones. The valet did an awesome job of taking care of my car. The one big thing about the Cortez is that you can leave all of the hustle and noise of the strip and have a peaceful/romantic stay in Vegas. A great place to eat is Kittys cafe. the food is great and priced right. My wife loved everything about the Cortez. The part I loved the most was the thought that I was staying in a place where some of the stars in the 50s probably stayed. The Cortez is awesome.	
Oct 12 2006 	Glimpse of the past!	The El Cortez gave me a glimpse of glamour and charm that Las Vegas must have had in its early days. My room at the El Cortez was beautiful, with antique leather-topped mahogany furnishings, a great sitting area with a very confortable sofa and arm-chair. The room was surprisingly large, very clean and well maintained. All of the staff were courteous, helpful, and very friendly. The food in the hotels restaurants was so good and reasonably priced, that I ate all of my meals there. I met many locals who are regular customers in the hotel restaurants, which speaks very favorably for the food and the prices. The El Cortez is 2 short blocks to the Fremont Street Experience, which I walked by myself many times during my 4-day stay without any problems. The bus-stop was one block away so I bought the 24-hour Deuce pass each day and traveled up and down the strip many, many times. I will recommend the El Cortez to everyone I know.	
Oct 11 2006 	Fantastic stay at the EL CO	This is a fantastic place to stay. Some of the reviews I read scared the daylights out of me. My room was very clean. There were only small issues:1) No in-room safe2) Thermostat hard to read3) Bathroom is small (but seriously, how much time does one spend in the bathroom anyway?)4) No weather channelWhat they give you: shampoo, lotion and mouthwash. Also, the bars of soap are big compared to most hotels. I had read and asked about wireless internet and was told it was only available in the lobby. Funny, I had full scale signal in my room (cheetanetworks) and there was a button on the webpage for 30 free minutes.If you want a great room for a great price, stay here! No water pressure problems and plenty of hot water.	
Oct 6 2006 	Hidden Treasure on the 'Old Strip'!	What a diamond in the rough!! But make sure you stay in the 'Tower' rooms! Very good deals and an ok casino where you can really win! We always have a wonderful time coming to the El Cortez, the only negative is the front desk, not very friendly or knowlegeable. If this was changed and they became more hospitiable they would rule the strip!	
Sep 19 2006 	Better than expected	I stayed Friday and Saturday in a Pavillion room. From the previous reviews, I had expected a seedy dive. Well, that was NOT the case. The rooms in the Pavillion are like motel rooms with outside entrances. I was on the 5th floor. The rooms were clean, the towels were big and soft, and the beds were comfy. The TV was unimportant because who goes to Vegas to watch TV. The hotel is within walking distance of Fremont street where I spent most of my time. Played slots and actually left with more money than I arrived with. Also, had a wonderful dinner at Roberta's. It's a bit pricey, but worth it. When I departed, the bell man helped me load my luggage and the front desk arranged an airport shuttle. Overall, I LOVED the El Cortez and will stay there again my next trip.	
Aug 27 2006	El Cheapo	For $30 bucks a night- you pretty much get what you pay for. This my experience at El Cortez: I had reserved a non-smoking room, and they gave me the opposite. I had put the DO NOT DISTURB sign outside my door, and three hours into my stay, a maintenance man knocks on my door telling me that he had to fix the bathtub because it was not draining properly and the faucet was leaking. I got hungry, and thought I'd try their Chinese Buffet downstairs... it was the worst chinese food I've ever had. Worst than those fast food chinese places in your neighborhood. The location itself is pretty ghetto and slummy. And the hotel was kinda dirty. But like I said, you kinda expect these things when you're paying bargain basement price.	
Aug 8 2006	Ok for the price	Booked a two night stay on the El Cortez website at $30.00 a night prepaid with taxes it was about $65.00 total. The room was on the top floor of the parking garage, there were about 20 rooms on this floor. Absolutely nothing wrong with where the room was. It was quiet, comfortable and clean. Check-in was at 2:30pm and since I was early, I did have to wait. Front desk staff was pleasant and check-in easy. This is a old hotel, and the lobby and gaming area look it. Again, its ok for the price, in fact there was a promtion going on at the time, any guest staying in July or August was offered two free nights in Sept. I was not able to take advantage of this. The only low point was going to the bufett breakfast in the morning, $5.99, and it was like I would imagine going to a Salvation Army mission, or a bread line for the homeless. It was very poor, at least in my opinion, but again the bottom line, you get what you pay for. I would certainly stay here again, it is downtown, on Fremont St. and two blocks from the Fremont Experience mall.	
Jul 25 2006 	Tower rooms are fantastic!!	Stayed at the El Cortez for two nights at the end of June and was so pleasantly amazed at the room!! Had doubts, had read some bad things about some of the rooms and read that the Tower rooms were all recently renovated and very nice, so I gave it a chance. I was on the top floor (15th) and had a king non smoking, which was what I requested. The room has wonderful, dark woods, a little sitting area, and the bathroom had a little window in it (similar to some rooms at the Orleans) and I loved it!! Very comfortable bed, very quiet and would definitely stay there again.Now, the area is not the best and the outside of the hotel is not glamorous. The parking garage isn't top notch, but use valet parking and the problem is solved. Robertas steakhouse is a great restaurant there-the prime rib was huge and done perfectly!!Can't beat the price and I even had luck on the slots in the casino.	
Jun 17 2006	our stay	El Cortez, we found this a great place to stay, rooms large and cool facilities great.The service was great and the staff 1st class and very helpful, we booked through &quot;Boots and All&quot; booking agent on the internet, no problems on booking in we were on the 15th floor, I would reccomend this hotel to anyone.Thanks for the great stay.Trevor &amp; Val Service Hamilton New Zealand	
May 23 2006	Hated it	The El Cortez was the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. One bad experience after another. I stayed there for two days. When we got in the elevator to a pavillion room I knew there was a problem right away. When you get off the dirty elevator you are staring at a dirty window overlooking a dirty roof. This was only the beginning, the air conditioning sucked, not to mention the toilet. We saw people getting arrested and were woken up by a fighting couple in the next room. They also put a hold on my credit card even though I paid cash for the room. The staff was rude, when we saw a bell boy and we were tiredly carryng our luggage he did not even offer to take it. I will never stay there again. It was heaven to get out of there. Lori Canyon Country, CA	
May 11 2006	What a Difference	We just returned from 7 nites in Vegas, I usually stay at the Plaza downtown, however they were all booked on the week end so had to find accomodations elsewhere, managed to get the Fitz for 2 nites and the only alternative for the week end was the El Cortez, I had only been in the El Cortez once about 3 years ago,.and that was enough I got out of there fast being a single women on my own i thought it was slummy so. I was amazed at the change and our room was on the second floor over the casino, it had new funiture/broadloom and completely redone, actually better than the Plaza. I would return in a wink now.	
May 10 2006	El Cortez is improving....still has old-style charm	I spent a four-day trip in Las Vegas and didn't stay in the El Cortez, so I can't comment on the rooms, but I visited the casino all four days. The El Cortez has improved alot in the past year-----they have redone the ceilings, lighting fixtures and replaced the blackjack tables. The place is overall alot nicer....there is a bar/lounge in the back of the casino that I think is new that is really nice with a surprisingly good selection of beers on tap.The Tez still has single-deck blackjack, but any bet over $25 will draw a &quot;checks play&quot; signal from one of the dealers to let a pitboss know that there is serious player at the table. Prepare to be scrutinized by pit-bosses at single-deck tables.The real hidden gem of the El Cortez is &quot;Roberta's&quot; restaurant.......I had the double lobster tail for $40 and it was worth it, the lobster tails were both very big and well-prepared. A buddy of mine had the prime rib and liked it alot....I think it was only $17. My meal came with fresh bread, an outstanding and very large bowl of corn-chowder soup, rice pilaf, and steamed spinach. Only the rice pilaf was mediocre....and actually it wasn't that bad. I had planned on ordering the rack of lamb which was listed on the website as $18....it seemed to good to be true.....instead, when I got there they had lamb chops for $30....so I opted for the lobster. The service in &quot;Roberta's&quot; was great and the ambience was relaxing.....not spectacular, but very nice. I like the place alot and think it's very underrated and a great value.Summary---the El Cortez is a fun stop when downtown to see &quot;Old School&quot; Vegas....the place really isn't that crummy anymore and you have nothing to fear about the walk from the &quot;Fremont Experience&quot; overhang two blocks down to the El Cortez. Don't bother going to the Gold Spike or the Western (too trashy), but the El Cortez is worth a look.	
May 8 2006	Absolutely Horrible Experience	My wife, who has never been to Vegas, booked us in the El Cortez thinking it was &quot;on the strip&quot;. It isn't. It is in seedy downtown Las Vegas - an area where you might not feel comfortable walking after dark. Although my wife called ahead the morning we were to arrive confirming her request for a nonsmoker room, they did not save one for us. We were given a &quot;vintage&quot; room (code word for a room that has not been updated since 1950). At five AM the fire alarm went off for 20 minutes. The announcement said that evacuation was unnecessary, but they allowed the alarm to continue anyways. The next morning, we checked out, abandoning our already-paid next night. This was the most horrible experience we have had at ANY hotel ANYWHERE in the world. Too bad Trip Advisor does not allow a &quot;zero&quot; rating.	
May 7 2006	my vegas trip	went to vegas for the third time this april and once again had a blast! I just never get bored with that town. We stayed at the El Cortez for a few nights and was extremely impressed. the staff couldn't have been nicer and we weren't quite sure what to expect with the hotel itself. but I would go back there in a heartbeat. the rooms were very nice. and we even saw about 4 different ones. they were wonderful. I would definitly recommend this hotel to anyone. We also had a wedding at the stained glass chapel and found the staff there very nice. The wedding package wasn't quite what we had expected but it all worked out ok. I would definitly ask more specific questions next time about how their services work but all in all they were ok. but I would never go through the las vegas wedding authority again. They were misleading from the start. I have been calling since my return for a rebate that was promised for the package and they won&quot;t even answer my phone calls they got back within minutes to me when I was setting everything up and they wanted my money. but now they are totally ignoring me. so don't deal with the las vegas wedding authority. all in all had a wonderful time and plan to go back for our aniversary this fall.	
May 3 2006	Surreal Experience	We were going to a wedding on 4.20.06 in Vegas so we flew in a day early. Due to Atlanta Airports security scare (software glitch) we arrived in Vegas hours late. I confirmed with our internet reservation site (found through TripAdvisor) that our room would still be available. Our rental car had left hours earlier without us, so we hoofed it on the public bus for $1.25 each. It dropped us off 1 block from the El Cortez. Before reserving the room, I read all of the reviews and many reviews of similarly priced hotels. I &quot;bet&quot; on the El Cortez due to the location and the price. Pros: Price ($35 incl. tax per night)Location (1 block from Freemont Experience, Public City Bus or Strip Bus)Amenities (Gambling, Small C-Store, Restaurant, Barber shop on site)Ambiance (Classic Vegas as I remember it from years ago)Free Parking (We didn't use it but I saw that it was there)Room Toiletries (Nice assortment of soaps and girly stuff for the Misses)HVAC (No window unit, but a functioning thermostat unit not constantly blowing)Cons:No elevator to our specific room (Older section, we were on the 2nd floor)View from room (Rooftop of casino view with privacy screened window)Small Room (Not a problem for us as we cruise a lot)Due to the time difference and wedding events we were back and forth to the hotel every few hours. I felt safe at all hours.If you are a confident person in you own neighborhood you will be fine here. If you are a Nervous Mervis you will feel &quot;funny&quot;. Not necessarily because it is unsafe, but because you are just a more anxious person and out of your normal &quot;safety&quot; zone. I never felt unsafe and was grateful that such a reasonably priced hotel was downtown. There was police action all over Vegas. I look at it as the police are staying on top of crime or possible crime by being proactive. Any large city will have similar situations.I would definitely stay here again without hesitation. It is best for budget minded people. I'm to understand the more expensive rooms are much larger and have nicer views. Perhaps on our next trip I will upgrade. If you have Strip related business, you must allow for travel time. You can bypass the traffic/crowds on the Strip/Bus and take the Public City Bus that almost runs a loop around the strip. If you are driving, Maryland Ave. runs parallel about 5 blocks to the East of the Strip.Vegas is a fun place to visit for an interesting vacation.Due to the 3 hour time change, the travel delay, jet lag, the bright lights, noises, smells of the city, adult oriented themes, wedding chapels on almost every corner and general humanity it was a Surreal Experience. One that I hope to experience again soon!!!	
May 2 2006	Great budget hotel/casino	I absolutely loved my stay at the infamous El Cortez and would definitely stay here again. Arrived at the hotel at about eight thirty and check in took about 10-15 min's. Went up to room (#1004) and was pleasantly surprised with the cleanliness and size of the room, although the bathroom was pretty small. The hotel's casino has good /cheap black jack and $1.00 roulette which was a lot of fun and is only about two blocks from the Freemont st. experience. A lot of people have complained about the neighborhood and frankly I just don't get it. I never once felt unsafe when venturing out of the hotel to walk downtown or to the bus stop which was only about a block and a half away. At only $35 a night this place is a steal and highly recommended.	
Apr 29 2006	Great place..but...	We just got back from spending a week in Vegas at el Cortez. We spent six days in the tower room which was in excellent condition. The tower room was spacious and very clean definatly worth the extra money. Our room looked over the Valet parking which was ok cause we could watch over our car. We did hear some sirens but if you party right in Vegas when you are in your room you can sleep through anything. Housekeeping came really early so make sure to hang your sign on the door if you want to sleep past 8am. We also spent 3 days in a pavillion room wich was much smaller and literally above the parking garage. There were a lot of cameras and A security Guy who had a severe limp. I still felt safe though with all the cameras. The only downfall of the hotel was the staff. The check in staff was short and rude not what you want to encounter after spending 31 hours in a car to get there. Plus plan a good half hour to 45 min to check in only one staff person to a huge line. The cocktail waitress that we dealt with was even ruder...My husband was in the process of changing machines (we had been there for an hour and it was the first waitress to come around) when the waitress came around he asked for a coke and she refused to bring it because the game ticket that he had in his hand was still not in the machine. I had a 12:30 check out and they deactivated our keys at noon. so I had to wait 25 min for them to activate the key and then 35 min to check out once we able to get the baggage. The staff lady then chewed me out cause It was 1:15 before I reached the front of the line to check out. The building is in great condition, the area is secure, but the staff needs to learn to be more curteous, but then again how much time do you spend with the staff when you are in Vegas.	
Apr 27 2006	great value	23 y/o who traveled to vegas for only one night and needed a cheap place to stay. Didn't check out the casino, but my room was very adequate for the night. I payed $5 extra to stay in the tower and I could see that the rooms and hallways had been recently renovated. The room was very clean and water was hot, thats all I was looking for. TV didn't even have espn, but I'll let them slide since nobody spends to much time watching the tube. Overall, I would say if you want a clean, quite room with no frills, this is the place for you. Me? Oh ya, I would stay again, I am already planning on booking another room pretty soon.	
Apr 27 2006	Old Vegas Charm	I made my reservation at the El Cortez well in advance of my trip to Vegas April 17-22. Family and friends all had antidotes about the El Cortez and the downtown area. I found all thier concerns to be unfounded. We reserved a Jacuzzi suite and it was very impressive; Clean, comfortable, and no detail was left to chance. The desk staff, especially George, were all so kind and attentive to our every need. The valets were also equaly impressive. One afternoon we were to meet family across town. When I asked for directions, the valet was aware of rush hour traffic on the freeway, and was kind enough to provide me simple and very helpful directions to our meeting place. We only ate in Kittys once but found the food very good and the prices reasonable. From the hostest, to bus and wait staff, they all exibited a friendly attitude and willingness to serve. We made a couple of trips to the gift shop and found the merchandize of good quality and value. It was nice not to feel like they were trying to gouge you. As for the gaming areas, the slots were not as loose as we had hoped and the hostesses did not offer drinks very often; In fact we did not have a single drink served to us by a cocktail hostess. The casio was smoky at times but no more so than many of the other casinos we visited. All in all, the El Cortez was a great bargain and we would not hesitate to stay there again. For those looking for the old Vegas charm, the El Cortez has it.	
Apr 20 2006	The Good and The Bad - With Photos	THE FACTS: Stayed weekday,Tower, corner room (rooms in the corner with numbers ending in 14 or 15 are slightly larger). THE GOOD: 1) Cheap place to stay. $40. 2) Biggest standard room I've stayed in. Corner rooms only. 3) Clean for an older room. 4) Parking lot well lit. 5) Air conditioning worked great.THE BAD: 1) The area surrounding is suspect. Not recommended for kids/elderly. 2) Heard alot of &quot;security to...&quot; in casino from workers with walkie talkies. 3) Parking is free for everyone, so can be hard to find at night. Upper levels were closed that night for some reason. 4) Bathrooms are small, but typical of older hotels. 5) Hot water more like luke warm in the late morning. Other times fine.CONCLUSION: My wife and I would stay here again if looking for a cheap place at the last minute. We thought the rooms were very spacious and generally clean, although we can't attest to the carpet since we travel with slippers. We stayed at the Las Vegas Club on Fremont the night before and The California the night after and El Cortez was much better than Vegas Club, but not as nice as California (both reviewed). We didn't try the restaurants at the El. Check out the photos, but excuse the mess!	
Apr 14 2006	Cheap and Cheerful El Cortez	Booked the El Cortez as it was really cheap. Stayed at the beginning of April 06. When we got there Reception were very slow, however worth the wait as they upgraded us to a Tower Room, which is in the new wing of the hotel. The room was very nice, with fruit, mints and chocolates in and very clean. It was a minutes walk from Fremont Street. We played roulette which had $1 minimum bets, fantastic, especially when you get free drinks playing on the tables. Dont be put off by anyone saying its a bit rough, if you have ever been to London its a million times safer! I Recommend this hotel if you are on a budget.	
Apr 2 2006	great	I stayed at four different hotels in Vegas. El Cortez surprisingly had the biggest and nicest rooms. There was no pool and the hotel was not on the strip but a 2 minute walk to the Freemont St. Experience Five minute walk to the city bus depot that will take you anywhere on a bus for $2. The service was good. I would definitely recommend this hotel for the low price we paid. Very satisfied.	
Mar 5 2006	Fun stay at the El Cortez	My husband and I stayed at the El Cortez February 23-March 1, and were very happy with our stay. We stayed in a queen vintage room above the casino, its probably worth the extra 5 bucks to upgrade to a tower king (we checked out the tower, and it is a lot nicer), but we liked our room  it was cute and cozy, vintage is an accurate description. The shower/bath was clean and had good water pressure, the room itself and most importantly the bed linens were very clean. I did notice some dust on the moldings however. Our room was quiet; we could not hear the casino noise from our room, only once were we woken up by noise, someone slamming a door to the room across the hall. There was a new flat screen TV with a decent amount of cable channels. There is no elevator to the queen rooms above the casino floor. For $30 a night, $50 on the weekend, we felt we got a great deal.The front desk people were brisk, but not unfriendly, the rest of the staff were nice. Housekeeping was excellent, new bedding, towels, glasses, soaps, etc. every day. Parking was easy. The casino was OK, authentic 60s décor and all. It was laid back, and a good place to hang out, gamble &amp; relax after a long day of running around sightseeing. We didnt try Robertas or Kittys, the breakfast buffet was a typical breakfast buffet, nothing great, but not too bad either.Its a short walk to the Fremont Street Experience. We felt safe the whole time and nobody approached us except for the time share shills inside the downtown casinos and the porn slappers on the strip, very annoying. During our stay we went to Red Rock Canyon and Valley of Fire parks, both were great daytrips.I think most of the previous reviews are right on, it depends on what type of traveler you are. For us the El Cortez was perfect, a clean, comfortable, convenient and cheap place to hang out and stay, but it is not glamorous or glitzy.	
Feb 22 2006	Loved it but know what to expect!	As the previous reviews note if you want a classy, flashy, special occasion sort-of hotel then the El Cortez is not it - you will need to go onto the Strip or check into the Golden Nugget. However for the prices (generally from about $35 weekdays, $65 weekends) this is a decent, old-style casino-hotel. The main level seems to be divided into two areas where you can almost tell the old part (front casino, Careful Kittys restaurant) and the new part (check-in, Robertas Steakhouse, Gift shop, etc) - the new areas are very tasteful and hold their own with some of the other downtown properties. The casino itself is a little smokey (not too bad though) and locals seem to outweigh the tourists in the place. The gaming is cheap - $3 minimums on a lot of tables and plenty of up-to-date penny games. Staff are a little curt but I'm guessing that being a Brit they seemed to have a little trouble understanding me sometimes (I doubt there are many Europeans that stay downtown compared to the Strip) - I had issues with the maid leaving the door open in our room (it did not shut correctly and had to be slammed) and an issue with my leaving date (they got it wrong) - apologies were not forthcoming but they did fix it and that was good enough for me.There is a free express airport shuttle from early morning to early afternoon (I'm not sure it picks you up - just seems to drop you off) and the cocktail waitresses look after more than other properties.Poker players might like to know that there is a poker room and it seems the only place downtown which offers a stud game. I will mention the area it is in. If you are used to street people then thats ok - but it is two blocks away from the Freemont Street Experience (and the rest of downtown casinos) and one block from the Strip shuttle buses. In two stays I have never had any trouble other than the occasional request for some coins but some of the people may alarm you. I certainly would not advise you to walk in the other directions alone.	
Feb 21 2006	El Cortez	The front desk is Rude and the note efficient at all!They don't acccomadate any request even though it was already listed on the online reservation. The tower room we booked online was not given to us even though we paid for one. we got ripped off.the bath tubs were scary looking and the shower heads so low, it was hard to take a shower if you were tall.the beds were on the soft side.the rooms and hall ways had horrible smells.the only good thing was the very friendly maid.the walls were thin, you can hear things easily, even when the room above you has the shower head on.Don't stay unless you are dirt poor and have no place to sleep.	
Feb 16 2006	The best kept secret of the locals...	The El Cortez Hotel is far, far nicer than some folks will admit. The rooms have been recently remodeled and totally refurbished to rival any on the &quot;Strip&quot;. In fact, their rooms are the finest in the downtown area. I've stayed in the tower rooms, and they're comparable to the best anywhere, offering nice views and comfortable, rich furnishings. The housekeeping service was prompt and the staff assured my room was impeccably clean. I asked for an iron and ironing board, and it was delivered within minutes.I found the best food in the area at the El Cortez too, especially the breakfast buffet on the weekend. There's a Subway and other Fast Food/Coffee venues as well. I particularly liked the 'specials' at Careful Kitty's Cafe for lunch and supper. I had a Prime Rib dinner with all the trimmings for less than $8, and it was delicious. Roberta's is the up-scale restaurant at the El Cortez, and I treated myself once to their Lamb one night. Spectacular, Primo, and what can I say... It was the best dining experience in downtown Las Vegas for the price. The only thing could possibly complain about is the neighboring area just east of the El Cortez. If you're driving, please use the valet parking, or the self-parking. I've never had any problem in the 15 years I've walked around there, but if you walk from the Fremont Street Experience area, use your &quot;street savvy&quot;. Well, that goes for all of Las Vegas... Check the room rates at the El Cortez and then plan your vacation. You'll be very pleased with your room and the amenities!	
Feb 1 2006 	Fantastic Suite	The biggest thing I see going against the El Cortez is the location. We booked a jacuzzi suite in advance for $100 per night and the room was fabulous. It didn't have much of a view since the room overlooked the valet parking lot. We thought that was great as we could keep an eye on our vehicle. The room was spotless, new and I enjoyed the stay (especially the jacuzzi tub). We ate at the steakhouse and the food was neither to brag about nor gag about. It was excellent for the price and the service was good also. As for the casino, we aren't really gamblers but did piddle about a little. It was comfortable, quiet and paid back enough to at least let you sit and play a bit. My only gripe is that I missed the Freemont Street Experience because we were afraid to go out the front doors after dark. The locals in the area are not someone you want to have a conversation with. We stayed in the hotel and felt totally safe &amp; comfortable, but nothing short of a bomb threat or earthquake could have gotten us to go out those front doors. Sirens went all night long, but I expect everyone in that area heard them, not just those of us in the El Cortez so I didn't hold that against them either. Service was very friendly and helpful. Again, my only real complaint is that I didn't feel safe walking nearly 2 blocks to Freemont so we didn't do it. My best advice if you are looking for a decent room and don't mind hiring a taxi is to book a suite in advance and at least enjoy the room. I've seen bad reviews on the older rooms, but the suite was really cherry and priced for less than what a standard room costs on the strip.	
Jan 18 2006	A Mediocre Place	We stayed there for four nights in a double-double Pavillion room. After reading about the &quot;open-aired&quot; &quot;garage downstairs&quot; review, I tried to get a tower room and was told they were all booked. It is a motel-like room on the 5th floor (1-4 are garage). The room is clean. The bathroom is small, and there is no sitting area. Since we spent most of the time on Strip, it didn't bother us much. I hanged the &quot;donot bother&quot; sign outside every morning, the maid didn't knock our door, but knocked all the others and shouting &quot;room service&quot; A little uncomfortable for us.The casino was smokey, the front desk clerk was OK. But I really didn't think much of the food in the Kitty Cafe.The most important part, the safety, which I worried a lot before the trip. The hotel is one block to the bus stop(Deuce) and two to the Canopy.Although I didn't have any problem walking back to the hotel with my parents at night (the street is well lit and there are people walking around), the neighbourhood didn't look nice. I don't suggest walking alnoe at night.In summary, considering the price, it is an acceptbale place, but a strip hotel will definetly be better. Don't forget that you need to take a bus to the strip. Sometimes, the trip would be longer than what you think. We spent one hour and 10 mins to get to MGM from Fremont.	
Jan 2 2006	Excellent value	I had read the negative reviews and must admit I was worried about staying at this hotel. (We were there in August, 2005.) However, to my suprise, it was excellant! I have stayed at Mirage, MGM, Harrahs, etc. and they were also nice but way, way overpriced. I come to Vegas to gamble not stay in my room! Yes, the casino was a bit smokey, but bearable. I am not a smoker but I still gambled quite a bit at the El. The food was good and the rooms were clean. The bathroom was small but clean. Also, you didn't have to walk a mile to get to your room when you got off the elevator. (that's nice after all the walking that you do while in town) The crowd was a little older than the strip crowd. However, this was not an issue for us. I agree that this is not the place to stay if this is your first trip to Vegas, but I believe this is by far the best value in Vegas for seasoned Vegas vacationers! By the way, we plan to be in town again next week, staying at the El Cortez!	
Dec 3 2005	Greatly Surprised!!	We were under a budget for this trip to vegas. We read reaviews and after many others who have already been to vegas warning us about &quot;downtown&quot; I am glad we booked this hotel. The staff was a bit rude and slow at times, but you pay what you get for. The room was VERY large in the tower (compared to what I've stayed in at other budget hotels). The rooms did not reek of smoke(we stayed in a smoking room, our friends did smoke next door) The bathrooms were a bit weird and the showers could use some attention (the shower heads sprayed weird) All in all, the 40 bucks a night was well worth it compared to the hundereds to stay on the strip. As for safety, I personally felt safer downtown in Fremont than on the strip. We saw plenty of officers and bike cops downtown. When we were on the strip it seemed like every few inches we were being harrassed by the &quot;strippers direct to you&quot; people. I would highly recommend this hotel to any budget traveler.	
Nov 10 2005	Good value if you are open minded	I had read the reviews prior to booking about the El and had mixed feelings about staying here but couldn't resist it as the rates were so cheap for the weekend.We managed to get a tower room on the top floor with a fantastic view of the strip. We requested a non smoking room (I am a smoker but my husband is not), and they could not accommodate us, however, the room was not smokey at all, and it had a nice big window you could open up! Only negative about the room was you could hear what was happening in the room next to you and people in the hallway, especially housekeeping early in the morning. We hung our do not disturb sign out each night and were not intruded upon by housekeeping, contrary to some previous reviews we had read.Yes, the casino is SMOKEY to the extreme, and even being a smoker I could not hang out in the casino for too long. My husband wanted to walk up to Fremont Street on our first night and I was reluctant because of what I had read about it being too risky to walk from the El to Fremont Street after dark, but my husband assured me he would look after me!!! All concerns were unfounded - it is ONLY about 100 yards and quite well lit up so we didn't see what the issues were all about. It was fine.We didn't gamble too much at the El as they only had single deck blackjack so we did most of our gambling at other casinos, however, we probably had our best meals in Vegas at the El. We had lunch at Careful Kitty's one day which was surprisingly good, and we had dinner the first night at the steakhouse restaurant, and loved the meal and service so much we went back the next night. Do not underestimate this restaurant - better than most we ate at in Vegas on our trip.The clientele at the casino we found interesting, however, security was on hand quickly for the couple of minor incidents we witnessed!I only had two complaints about the El. One already mentioned about the smokey casino - the other the elevators - scarier than riding up the top of The Stratosphere. Never felt I was going to make it to the top floor and avoided going to my room unnecessarily. (I'm not one much for heights at the best of times and do have a problem with a bumpy ride!)Overall, the casino I would rate as ordinary, the location is not as scary as some people have mentioned, the food in the steakhouse was great, and for the money you pay it is fantastic value if you are not after all the frills and swankiness of Vegas.	
Nov 8 2005	Pretty decent for the price...	I booked this room through Travelworm and got it for $35/night during the SEMA car show in Vegas when all of the prices at all other hotels went WAY up. I was happy to find something reasonable during that time. Surprisingly, the room was tastefully decorated (we got a room in the old, vintage section). My only complaints was that there was a fan right outside of our window that was REALLY loud and that there was never hot water in the shower (lukewarm at best). There was always parking in the garage and the food at the coffee shop was really good (we got 2 $5 certificates at check-in, which made the breakfast really cheap). Also, the DO NOT DISTURB sign didn't seem to work that well in that they knocked twice to see if we wanted our room cleaned, even though the sign was up. It's in kind of a sketchy neighborhood. I was asked for money and if I wanted to buy drugs more than once. This really doesn't bother me that much, but I could see how it could some people. I didn't gamble at all at the hotel, just used it as a place to sleep and drove to do other things. I'm not sure if I'd necessarily stay there again, but it was okay.	
Nov 4 2005	Have not stayed here and now I never will....	After reserving a room here and unfortunately having to have cancelled it, my checking account was charged one nights stay in error. Apparently there was a mixup between Hotel kingdom and the hotel and each is blaming the other for it. Subsequently, I am out that nights stay and bank fees. I have attempted several times to resolve this with their accounting department to no avail. I have not received phone calls back from upper management after a first call which led to no resolution.It is obvious that they have no interest in fixing their mistakes or in taking care of customers, nor does Hotel Kingdom. I have attempted to contact both businesses to resolve this.I sincerely hope that no one else has a similar experience. I would recommend blocking any charges in the event you have to cancel your reservation so that your situation does not end up like mine, costing you time, money and a poor experience.	
Oct 31 2005	Second Visit and Plan on More	This was my second trip to the El Cortez this year. Got another large, clean room on one of the upper floors with a view of the mountains. The rooms are neither perfectly spotless nor exquisitely decorated, but they are a level of clean above reasonable, quiet, and very comfortable. And you won't find rooms this spacious at this price anywhere else in LV. The rooms are more than adequate for sleeping and showering. And I was again amazed at the efficiency of their only two elevators. I don't think I ever waited longer than one minute to hitch a ride going up or down between the casino and my 11th floor room. The casino also gets another thumbs-up. However, if you're sensitive to smoke, questionable fashion choices, or some &quot;fringe&quot; members of society, this probably won't be your scene. Being a serious slot player, smoker and people watcher, this is my kind of place. Plenty of newer slots (and some &quot;old&quot; classics) with loose tendencies - even won a couple of decent jackpots on the same night. Attendants were quick to bring out the paperwork and money and were very friendly. Decent drink service most of the time (and for the love of Pete, remember to tip the waitresses/bartenders. If you can afford to gamble, you can afford to tip a buck a round while you're playing). No, this is not where the beautiful people hang out. But then, I went to many of the Strip casinos where the beautiful people did hang out, and witnessed more of them being drunk and disorderly than the El Cortez crowd. My only complaint about the casino was the the sound system (this time they had some sort of poor quality smooth jazz - bring back the oldies rock!).As for the surrounding area, it's a quick step over to the Fremont Street (not even a 3-minute walk) area and, if you use common sense and keep alert, you shouldn't have any problems. My sense is that those that wig out about some of the locals hanging about (maybe one low profile hooker, one junkie, and/or one homeless person between the El C and Fremont Street) have spent little if any time in a typical city. However, I wouldn't advise walking in any other direction than towards Fremont Street. Take a bus or taxi from downtown to the Strip - do not walk that stretch day or night, no matter what your state of sobriety, physical fitness, or personal weapons. In closing, if you're a seasoned Vegas visitor and just want a decent place to stay and gamble, go to the the El C by all means. I wouldn't recommend it for Vegas newbies, prima donna types, or people under 25. In fact, this applies for the downtown casino/hotels in general. I hope to get back soon!	
Oct 28 2005	Please Please ~Reconsider another hotel	Please, reconsider your stay at this hotel, you are definitely putting yourself in harms way to save a few dollars. I stayed here for four days, and a past Las Vegas resident, and remember Fremont Street before the &quot;experience&quot;. When someone stays at a hotel/casino where people gamble, it is the hotels/casino's responsiblity to insure their quests, and others security are priority ONE, but not at the El Cortez. I was threatened by a many casino patron (I am a disabled person) to &quot;take me outside&quot; just for watching, and when I filed a incident report, they ignored it because the patron was spending his cash at the table. I ended up staying in my room in fear for my life. The room had no security lock, the door didn't close completely, the single pane windows were &quot;screwed shut&quot;, and the ceiling leaked water while the water drain outside the window constantly ran keeping me awake. I am still trying to recover from this two weeks later. The hotel security, and staff were seen in uniform playing slots, texas-holdem, and tables games to get advantage over the people, now think about that for a moment. One evening while eating at &quot;Careful Kitty's&quot; resturant (btw the food is the worse) in the El Cortez, a drunk patron started a fight, threw his meal all over the counter at others, and screamed he wasn't going to pay (trying to get a free meal) hitting me with food. Security didn't show up for 10 minutes, and when they did, they didn't escort him out, they just made him pay his meal, never asking the other patron, or guests if they were alright. It doesnt do any good to complain, they just don't care, and you are putting yourself in grave danger both in the hotel/casino, and the walk down Fremont Street unlit, bums asking for hand-outs, and no lighting walking outside the El Cortez. Be sure to carry mase, or something to protect yourself, and honestly, i don't know about you, or where some of these people who stayed are trying to fool, but I suggest you read these other negative reviews. Your safety is more important then saving a few bucks, &quot;especially in this part of Las Vegas&quot;, and there are other hotel/casino's besides the El Cortez. I had stayed for three days prior at Harrah's on the strip with no problems like this, and with it being the weekend, I couldn't just pickup and go to another hotel/casino because they were all booked for the weekend. Also, recall that all hotel/casino's have security cameras everywhere, but what good are they if you don't protect the people. I remember downtown not like this, it used to be safe, and with 5000 people moving to vegas a MONTH, many end up on the streets of downtown, not on the strip. Im sure you've seen the cop show on tv, where do you think the incidents happen? You quessed it. As for the El Cortez, you only get what you pay for, isn't that the truth !! In closing, many many people carry cash in these casino's, and what good is it if your life is at stake? I realize some have had no problems, while others have, but for heavens sake, how many complaints does it take before someone's life is taken over money!	
Oct 8 2005	Pleasantly surprised	My father, who passed away almost two years ago, introduced me to the El Cortez back in the early eighties. This is where he and my mom liked to stay when visiting Las Vegas. It has became a tradition for my husband and I to stay at the hotel everytime we go to LV. Recently on our last visit, I walked into the lobby and was very impressed with the new decor. The lobby seemed more spacious and the old carpet had been replaced. At the enterance sat a huge beautiful table with an exquisite flower arrangment. The reception desk, though small, had also gotten a face lift. When we went to our room in the Tower, I couldn't believe my eyes, the room was absolutey beautiful. Beautiful antique furniture, new wall paper and paintings hung on the walls. The comforter matched the wall paper and the theme of the wall art. The carpet was brand new. Even the television was new!! The only thing I was disappointed in, was the drastic price hike. We have never paid more then $39.00 for our room, and now we paid $79 for one night!!!! I guess you get what you pay for. Even the hotel guests seems to be, pardon me, of a more sophisticated class. It never bothered me that the hotel was located in a not so &quot;good&quot; part of town. In the many years that we have stayed here, never have we encountered any problems. Kudos!!! We even have a reservation booked for December. Thanks El Cortez for always making our stay a pleasant one. This one is for you Dad. The G's from Ca.	
Sep 24 2005	Hotel El Cortez Great Place to Stay	This was our first trip to Vegas, and we were looking for a nice and reasonable place to stay. The El Cortez is off the Fremont Street Experience, but the walk was not bad. The hotel is located in a diversed part of town, but we did not have any trouble at all and were not afraid to walk back to the hotel at night. The room was small but very well decorated and clean and confortable no problem with nose. But would stay in the main building next time. The food was good and staff was pleasant. Gambling was good and we only seemed to win or break even at the El Cortez.The staff were great, the valets were extremly friend and helpful. We would recommend this hotel to any one that would like to go to Vegas and not have to pay a arm or leg for a confortable and pleasant hote.	
Sep 5 2005	Great Stay at El C	We stayed at the El Cortez for 2 nights (out of a 6 night trip) because it was too expensive to stay on the strip for the weekend. Check-in was not super friendly but quick and easy. We were given a nice 14th floor tower room with a view of the strip. The room was very nice other than the small bathroom. The room was also very clean and quiet. The carpeting and all furniture were new and nice. The casino isn't bad either although not very exciting. The casino is no longer dark and smokey nor crammed. You can get a free deck of cards or dice for signing up for the slot club, as well as 1,000 points and some other good coupons. We did eat at Robertas one night, which was one of our best meals of the trip. The restaraunt was somewhat plain but still felt elegant and the food was very good. If you have a 50% off coupon Robertas is certainly worth it and still a decent deal if you don't. The walk to freemont wasn't really that bad, and the hotel is as close to the bus as any other downtown casino. It was a great place to stay for 2 days although not very convenient if you spend most of your trip on the strip, or like to swim.(no pool)	
Jul 27 2005	I enjoyed the El Cortez	The hotel is old but charming.I am 26 years old and I must admit I only saw a few people who were either my age or younger(less than a hand full).It is definately oldschool, but I happen to like that.The rooms are large but they have a small bathroom.The bathroom does have a window that opens for fresh air.My favorite part about the El Cortez is the blackjack.They have $3 tables with good rules and still pay 3:2. I love the side bet also.This Hotel/Casino doesn't compare to the strip mainly because of its location and clientel (sp?). But it is a fun experience.I understand this hotel is not for everyone though. If you love and are use to staying on the strip than this Hotel is probably not for you.If you are like me and just go to Las Vegas to have fun, drink, and gamble with low limits than it's worth a try.	
Jul 23 2005	Don't waste your time	When I told the cab driver where I was staying, he did a double take. That should have been my warning but since I had no where else to go, I was stuck.To say this place is tired is an understatement. Upon entering, it took me about 10 minutes to locate the 'front desk'...which is little more than a recessed kiosk. I got to the elevator and into my room. The room was cavernous...very large and covered in old stained pink carpeting. The doors rattled and the lock didn't seem secure. At night, I wedged a chair against the door for added protection.This was a huge room but the sparse furniture in the room was all set around the walls and made the room uncomfortably large. The bed was set against one wall and the small tv was set all the way across the room on an old dresser. It was so far away, the remote didn't work unless I got out of bed and walked up a few feet.The casino itself is old...old...old. Carpeting is old, stained and tired. Much like the elephant's graveyard, I truly believe this is where gamblers to go die. I played some texas hold 'em there and true to some of the 'press' the owner sat down and played with us. He was a nice enough guy but has some serious health problems and drank himself into a stupor while playing. The drink lady obviously knew him well and had been there for years. She was visibly concerned about his health and questioned his drinking...which just aggrevated the owner. It was not a pleasant scene and was actually depressing. The owner eventually staggered away.While at the table, I struck up a conversation with the guy next to me. We were having a pleasant conversation and this particular dealer ragged on us incessantly about 'table talking'. I like social games and that's half the fun but this guy ragged us to the point that we quit tipping him. The other guy eventually told the dealer to go ---- himself and left and I followed suit. The casino is a block off from the Fremont Street Experience and block you have to cross is a concern. The cab driver warned me not to be out at night in that area. He said there were a lot of crack heads and they were known to mug people. I ended up playing downtown a lot but made my way back before dark each evening.Careful Kitty's is ok. It's an old diner. Food was alright and the service was friendly.There were lots of old tired-looking people hanging around who appeared to have health related problems. I'm truly sorry for these people but I was there to have fun and it was just depressing.I went back there once with my girlfriend to show her the place. She couldn't believe I actually stayed there. She played some slots and then said that the place 'creeped' her out and she wanted to leave NOW...I'll stay downtown anytime and actually prefer it to the strip but I'll never make this mistake again. The room was cheap but I paid a much higher price by sacrificing my enjoyment. I've been to Vegas many times and this was, by far, the worse experience I've ever had.	
Jul 6 2005	Much more than you pay for	Wow, I was really impressed with this place. I visited the casino in Nov 2004 and received a room offer with a weekend rate of $35. I took them up on that and was really glad I did. Just the casino alone has been cleaned up and refurbished since my last visit. I hadn't seen the rooms before, but I was VERY pleased. The room was HUGE (I had a tower king room). The check in clerk was very nice, checked us in early around 11am, and offered us a strip view (which we took and was very nice). The room had obviously been recently remodeled. The bathroom was a little small but not uncomfortable. There was the bedroom area and a semi seperate sitting area. This room was easily worth twice what I paid for it, especially for a weekend in Vegas. Highly recommended.	
Jun 15 2005	Loved El Cortez!!!	My husband and I stayed June 4th and 5th at the El Cortez. Our room was neat and decorated very nicely. We loved playin at the casino and I actually won$2800.00. on the second night there playing keno. For Friday and Sat. nights, you can't beat the price and it keeps us away from the crowded strip on the weekend. We will definitely stay there again!	
Jun 6 2005	Hidden Gem / OK area	The El Cortez Hotel in Vegas is a great little hidden gem as long as you know what to ask for and as long as you know where you are in the neighborhood. The hotel has a great old school feel to the lobby and casino. Plenty of different slots, video poker and some basic tables... If you are staying in the main part of the hotel, not the motel house, or the extension, but the recently upgraded rooms, then you are in for a treat. The rooms are excellent. Great, tasteful and clean... the bathroom still maintains an old 70's look, and it almost feels like you are in a submarine since the enclosure comes up and over your head. Other than that the deal is incredible and hard to beat. The cost for those rooms are next to nothing compared to some less than respectable hotels on the strip. Just keep in mind, you are located well off the strip and a few blocks from fremont experience. Some say its just a short walk, but its what you have to walk through to get there. The neighborhood is not the safest nor is it the cleanest. I am a single man in my 30's and would not dare walk the dark street to get to fremont experience. I preferred to stay at the El Cortez. Last note, food is just ok, stay away from the steak, and they don't serve to-go orders yet...	
May 29 2005	pleasantly surprised	We stayed here on the Friday and Sat night of our trip when the rooms on the strip were more than we were wanting to pay. We went in with low expectations and they were exceeded the rooms are basic but clean. The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful we were pleasently surprised the only complaints we had was the water in the shower was tempermental going from icy to scalding without touching it. The service at careful kittys was poor also the busgirl got our tip as she did most of our serving. Metting the owner of the casino was excing to me his hidey ho how ya doin made my day.	
May 8 2005	Would Definitely Stay Again!	Stayed at the El Cortez April 30 through May 2. Here's the rundown:Although the front desk clerk was a tad cranky (in her defense, the front desk seems to be understaffed), she was quick and let us check in early. We got a room on the 14th floor (Room 1414), which was very large and clean. The bathrooms are tiny, but everything was clean and functional. Comfortable beds, and a very comfy loveseat to lounge on while checking out the view of the mountains. I also dug how the elevators to the rooms are right inside the casino - no hiking through 4 miles of hallways to get to your room. The three nights we were there were quiet. Maid service was efficient and thorough.We only ate once at Careful Kitty's Cafe while we were there. Food was marginal - probably wouldn't eat there again. Didn't get a chance to try Roberta's.I enjoyed the casino. Yes, it's a little rough around the edges, but that only added to its charm. Easy to navigate, and the cocktail staff was decent. I only play slots, and found a good variety to choose from. While I didn't hit anything big at the Cortez, the slots are much looser than those on the Strip. The clientele is mostly middle-aged, blue collar, and low-key. There are a few &quot;character&quot; types there, but I found them much less annoying than the look-at-me people and hoardes of college kids learning how to drink at the mega resorts. The casino in general had a relaxed vibe.The location of the Cortez was outstanding - just maybe a half-block walk to the main Fremont Street scene. As for this being a &quot;rough stretch&quot; to walk down, I didn't think so at all. I did see a couple of working girls and a homeless person, but big deal! It's a city. Don't bother them and they won't bother you. (However, I would not recommend walking down Las Vegas Blvd. from downtown to the Strip. It didn't appear to be a war zone per se, but there were a lot of vacant lots, boarded up buildings and dealers. Take the bus or a taxi.) I loved how it was just a few steps from the hotel to the Fremont Street action with its plentiful and accessible variety of casinos, food, and shopping. I've always stayed on the Strip before, but the Cortez has converted me to a downtowner. My husband doesn't care for the Vegas thing at all, and even he had a good time.All in all, I'd stay there again. If you're a low maintenance kind of person who wants somewhere clean, comfortable, and safe to stay and play, this is your scene. I'm looking forward to going back.	
Feb 18 2005	Love it!!!!!!	I really do like this hotel. Of course it isn't a super resort like Mandalay Bay or any of the other big strip hotels, but it's got that old Vegas charm which is what I like. It's very inexpensive. One of the times I stayed there I received a certificate to come back in a few months for free. It was like if you stayed two nights during a certain month, you could come back again for two nights for free in a few months.	
Feb 1 2005	LIKED IT!	We got a cheap price ($240 pp flight/hotel, 2nights, from cleveland). The rooms were very impressive! They were clean and updated, the furniture was very nice! we had stayed before at the Golden Nugget (which is very nie) and the Four Queens (which we did not enjoy at all). The El Cortez rooms were as nice as our Golden nugget room. The casino itself was sort of dingy, but we wanted $3 blackjack tables, and defiantely found them. The food in the hotel was decent, yet pricey for las vegas. We felt secure at the hotel. We defiantely would stay there again! As for the loose slots, we did not experience that, but others seemed to.	
Jan 17 2005	Pleasantly surprised.	Have stayed here twice in the last year, both times in the Tower. On the first trip the room was satisfactory, clean and well maintained, although the decor was a bit tired. They seem to be systematically refurbishing the hotel and on the second trip the room was newly refurbished to a very good standard. The staff, in my experience, are friendly and helpful. The casino floor is perhaps not somewhere you would choose to linger and it does seem to cater for the locals rather than tourists. The hotel is conveniently situated 100 yards from Fremont Street and the bus stop to the Strip. I have been pleasantly surprised by this hotel, given its varied feedback, and would recommend it as reasonably priced accommodation.	
Jan 10 2005	Surprised?? No Shocked!!!	My wife and I have gambled at the EC for many years. The casino is old and smokey but very friendly. We never really considered staying there because we thought the rooms would also be very old and smokey. Well we got an offer in the mail for three free night in December and decided to check it out. I assured my wife that if the room was a dump we would leave immediately. We specifically asked for a Tower room and were assured that we would get one (not one of the &quot;old&quot; rooms). When we checked in we were given room 603 in the Tower. We went up to the room a bit apprehensive. We got off on the 6th floor to find new carpeting in the hallway and everything very clean. We opened the door to our room and were shocked. The room was clean as a whistle with new carpeting, drapes and furnishings. It was much nicer than we thought it would be. The bathroom is a bit small but the room was good size. We were very pleased with our room. I cannot attest to the old rooms, but the tower rooms, while not the Bellagio, are better than the rooms at the Plaza, the Vegas Club and the Lady Luck. We would definately stay at the EC again.The only problem we found with the room is that the hot water is VERY hot. Be careful in turning it on.	
Dec 31 2004	Worst Hotel Ever!	If you love cramped quarters, filthy bathrooms, cold showers, and non-functioning basics like the ice machine and room thermostat, then the El Cortez will thrill you like no other hotel I've ever seen! After my recent stay there, I'm convinced &quot;El Cortez&quot; is Spanish for rathole. While I expect the casino to be smokey, the smell of smoke is pervasive throughout the building - even in the non-smoking rooms. The casino itself is the smokiest, and most poorly-lit I've ever seen, as well. The bottom line - if you're a smoker who plans on spending only enough time in the hotel room to wash your face and crash, then this might be the place for you. Otherwise, sleeping in your car and taking spongebaths in the local 7-11 will be more comfortable.	
Dec 21 2004	love the el cortez	spent last 5yrs. at this resort . we go theretwice a year. Great food great prices, but most of all great machines . great tower rooms. fiendly a homelike atmosphere. when we go to vegas we go to play and they give you nice comp. if you want to sightsee then you go to the strip,but if you want good machines, fiendly local atmospere, and a good time gambling ..go to the el cortez we love it.	
Dec 9 2004	Vintage Vegas at its Best? Worst?	If you're looking for vintage Las Vegas with a side-order of seedy, you'll LOVE the El Cortez! It is neither a resort or a theme park like its Las Vegas Strip and Freemont Steet counterparts... it's an old hotel with an old casino where people go to gamble, drink and best of all, avoid children! It's a little stinky and a lot smokey, but that just adds to its retro charm. The room rates are fantastic, the slots are loose and the tables have low limits. It's like stepping back in time. While there have been complaints about the neighborhood, a recent effort by the city to clean up the downtown area has proven positive. You might still run into a pesky bum or two on the street, but they seem harmless enough. Again, its part of the experience. And there is plenty of security at the hotel and on bicycle around the premises. Perhaps the El Cortez isn't the right choice for Mr. &amp; Mrs. Middle-America who are looking for Las Vegas as portrayed on the Travel Channel. Those of you would be better off to STAY on The Strip and, frankly, avoid downtown all together. But those of you who are looking for a taste of vintage Vegas; those of you who are looking for an attraction that &quot;just is&quot; and not developed by some marketing team; those of you who like it a bit on the sleazy side, the El Cortez is possibly the last great piece of Old Vegas.	
Nov 26 2004	Great Weekend!!	Stayed at the El Cortex Nov. 18, 19, 20....Was pleasantly surprised how clean and large the room and hallways were...stayed in 1209 with a postcard view of the strip...everyone there was friendly, check-in was fast and courteous and housekeeping was fabulous; appreciated the 20 dollar food coupons...variety of slots are the best downtown, and they pay much better than the strip....If you stay downtown, this is the most economical and best place to stay.	
Oct 18 2004	El Cortez	My wife and I just loved staying at the El Cortez hotel in Las Vegas. The rooms were very inexpensive compaired to other places we stayed at. There weren't any hidden cost.The cafe had a wonderful steak and lobster dinner for $9.95 and all the other meals we had were great. The staff from the bell hop to the dealers were so friendly and helpful. Our rooms were cleaned every day and no one rushed us.I will stay again. You save money to spend on other things in Vegas. I was very pleased with my stay there.Tom GilliamTennessee	
Oct 16 2004	Primo!	I was pleasantly surprized with my room at the El Cortez. The furnishings were that of a hotel room costing 5 times more on the 'Strip'; the housekeeping was superior, and the bedding was very comfortable. All the amenities one could want are for the asking, including a mini-refrigerator, iron/ironing board, or a hairdryer. &quot;Roberta's&quot; restaurant is a fine downtown choice for supper, but the &quot;Careful Kitty's&quot; coffee shop is best only for breakfast, both with good menus and reasonable prices. This is the best value of all hotels in Las Vegas!	
Aug 31 2004	great experience	We Had The Fortune Of Staying At The EL CORTEZ From 8/22 Through 8/26, 2004. We Found The Rooms Bright, Spacious And Extremely Clean. The Service Throughout The Hotel Was Fantastic, Especially At The Restaurant Where We Ate All Our Meals. The Meals Were Very Inexpensive And Delicious, Wether It Was Breakfast, Lunch, Or Dinner. The Casino Was A Pleasure To Play The Gaming Tables In, And We Hardly Had To Leave The Hotel During Our Five Day Stay. Thank You For Making Our Vacation So Trouble Free And Welcomming.We Will Definitely Return Again And Stay At The EL-CORTEZ.	
Aug 25 2004	Great place to play but avoid the "double double" rooms...	Just a heads-up to anyone staying at the El: make sure you reserve a Tower room, or even one of the Vintage rooms if you're a smoker. Steer clear of their &quot;Double-double&quot; rooms -- or at least know what you're getting into. They claim these rooms are in &quot;the main building,&quot; but they're actually in an open-air, motel-like annex built on the ROOF of their parking garage. Spring the extra $5 and get a room IN the hotel!That said, gambling at the El is terrific. No problem finding $5 single-deck blackjack on Fri-Sat. nights. I even sat in on a $3 table during prime-time Friday hours. Dealers were fine, and the cocktail waitresses were on the ball. They've cleaned up the place and turned up the lights a bit since I was there last summer, but it still has the feel of an &quot;old Vegas&quot; gambling hall, for adults only, which is nice. Crowd is mix of locals and tourists with its share of characters. One complaint about the casino is the smoke. I'm not a prude about smoking by any means, but after a night of gambling here, I was ready to cough up my lungs. Whew! The El should definitely invest in some air cleaning equipment!	
Jul 31 2004	Solid bargain!	I stayed at El Cortez for two nights. Yes, the lobby/casino area has that stale smoke smell and looks as though it hasn't been renovated in decades. However, the room we had was very clean and surprisingly large. If you're after luxury, this probably isn't the place for you; otherwise, it's a great value and the restaurants in the hotel are cheap and serve decent fare. I found the staff friendly and helpful, though I didn't push the limits with unusual demands. Overall, this is the perfect place to stay if you're looking for a bargain and don't require pampering. Staying downtown isn't for everyone, though it was nice to avoid the hordes spilling out along the strip. One plus is that it doesn't take you twenty minutes to exit the hotel as it does in one of those mega-casino/hotels on the strip.	
Jul 27 2004	Clean Family Run Hotel/Casino	Overall a clean hotel to stay in with security, a ride to the airport. Even a coupon to come back for a free nights stay. Was quiet and rooms where a little outdated but really clean. They took pride in that. Cable was not so hot. But a/c worked fine. One of the older casino, but none the less great in what it had to offer for the price. Would stay there again. Could use internet service.	
Jul 26 2004	I don't care what anybody says this is a great downtown hotel	I have just returned from a weekend at the glorious El Cortez Hotel on the eastern edge of downtown Las Vegas. I have previously been amused at the range of comments about the El Cortez. I feel sorry for those who did not enjoy their stay at this hotel. I found it wonderful, and I would sooner stay here than in any fancier hotel on the Strip. The stay came as a result of my golfing buddy, Silent Jon. He is a Vegas fanatic. The guy gets multiple letters in the mail offering him free rooms and meals. Silent Jon is the kind of guy the casinos love. He is not a high roller, or a low roller, but a mid roller. And dedicated mid rollers end up getting comp rooms at the El Cortez.Silent Jon and I were rewarded with a penthouse suite, on the house. Amazing. This was the finest room layout I have ever experienced in downtown Las Vegas. Silent Jon is like Vegas royalty, so I gave him the king sized bed. I used a convertible sofa bed, which was in a room adjacent to the master suite. Topping off the master suite as a full sized Jacuzzi. I found the roiom both comfortable and useful. The Jacuzzi got a workout on Saturday after we finished a round of golf in 106 degree heat. We both got off to a fast start on the El Cortez crap tables. Others have commented about the low minimums on the El Cortez gaming tables. They are right on. Silent Jon and I engage in a tag team crap roll in which we each kick in 20 bucks. I stunk when it came my turn to roll the dice. But Silent Jon was scintillating. Torrid. You name it. He did it. There was a black guy at the table who is a dead ringer for Laurence Fishburne. He must have made about $3,000 himself by betting judiciously on Silent Jon's ability to throw the dice. And there was another Vegas urchin who looked exactly like Christina Ricci. She was squealing with delight when Silent Jon parlayed a hard eight. Christina missed out on a lot of excitement. By the time we walked away, Silent jon turned our combined 40 bucks into 880. We split evenly down the middle, which is how we deal with our tag team rolls.All in all, I am delighted to have stayed in a penthouse suite at the delightful El Cortez hotel. I augmented the early crap roll with four aces on a video poker machine, and a new record for second tier keno payouts. I have a standard eight spot ticket that has rewarded me many times. On this visit, I reocrded one six out of eight, ten five out of eights, and ten four out of sixes. So there was never a dull moment at the El Cortez.	
Jul 22 2004	Get what you pay for	I love the 3 dollar ante single deck black jack!! You definately get what you pay for though. It's cheap and i wouldn't recomend eating at their restraunt. Freemont street is a block away, the bus stop is right there, hell i just need a hotel for a place to sleep i hardly stay there when i'm in vegas so it doesn't matter to me what it looks like, the beds are comfortable and the rooms are clean that is what matters so i give it a solid 3 star it saves you money so you can do some gambling... overall i liked the place	
Jun 28 2004	Our First Experience at the El Cortez	My husband and I were researching in the downtown area-around Fremont-for a review article.We went to the El Cortez,upstairs where I went into the ladies room.My husband stayed about 20 feet away at a bank of slot machines.On my machine was a coke and my purse.He was sitting at the next machine,guarding my things.A male waiter came over-told him to remove my purse from off of the slot-so my husband reached over to move the purse;but not before the employee grabbed for it also.My drink spilled all over my husband.I returned just as all this happened.My husband was upset,so we went downstairs and he sat at a blackjack table.A heavy-set pit-boss denied him from ordering a drink,and called Security on him.We left.Not going back there!	
Jun 27 2004	Okay for chain smokers	If the only thing you want to do in Vegas is smoke, drink, and gamble, then this place is perfect. Place is great given the price (as low as $20 a night if you book direct). I thought the food and service was very good too. However, the entire place stinks to high heaven of cigarettes, even in the non-smoking rooms. There was dried blood on the boxsprings and one of the lamp shades in my room. The place isn't too far from the strip, but it can take a long time to get there because of the traffic. For a little bit more, you can get a much cleaner place on the strip that will be closer to the shows and attractions.	
Jun 27 2004	Great Slots	I thought the El Cortez was a nice hotel/casino for the price. The rooms were clean enough and it wasn't very crowded. It took longer than expected to check in,but after a long flight I might have beeneager to get to bed. ( We arrived at 1:00 am )We plan on going back to Vegas and we'll alwaysconsider the El Cortez.	
Jun 26 2004	comfortable and a great time	I really enjoyed the Casino and Hotel. It wasn't too crowded with loads of people and the food was good. I never had to pay for a meal, they give you a coupon book worth 60.00 and I stayed for 5 days. Some waitresses were not as quick in busy areas. Has a bit of old charm as well as all the newer slots! Its also close to the old strip(walking distance) and there is a bus every 15 minutes to the new strip 24hrs, which is a few miles up the road!	
Jun 14 2004	much better than expected	I wanted a room with a jacuzzi . afer our new york new york plans fell through ( no money) we had to find somewhere we could afford. first off the room was $79.00 a night for a suite we expected a small room but some where we could celebrate alone. well we were blown away. the room was gigantic and very beautifully decorated. it could easily be compared to the higher priced strip hotels (beleive me i have been there) but it was quit and pleasant. and close to the fremont street expierence . we will be staying there again. 	
Jun 3 2004	You get what you pay for I suppose	The desk clerk was rude, the security insulting, the place old and decrepit but it was a comfortable bed and a reasonably quiet place to spend the night when we were only in town 8 hours.	
May 4 2004	Better than expected.	I must say that after reading some of the reviews on trip advisor I was expecting to check into a different hotel after one night at the El Cortez, but I was impressed with the room and it was actually an okay place to stay. The room was clean, a bit sparse, but for the price well worth it. I was a bit concerned about the security warning regarding walking to the parking lot, but the valet service took care of that problem. No problem walking down to the main area of Fremont for gambling, and as for gambling at the El Cortez it was okay. The clientel was mainly from the senior circuit but other than that it was a positive experience with the affordable table rates. Overall a thumbs up experience. 	
Apr 20 2004	As good as ever...	The El Cortez hasn't changed much in thirty years, and that fact thrilled me and my wife. My first stay at the El was thirty-one years ago - celebrating my twenty-first birthday. April 16, 2004 was my first trip back in over twenty years, and we loved it! The staff is friendly and helpful, the value is unbelievable, and the gaming excellent. I stayed in one of the original rooms (for old times sake), and it was clean, modern and comfortable. The food is wonderful and always a bargain. I got to watch Jackie G play Texas Holdem Sunday night, but the table was full and I couldn't get in the game. That would have been a thrill.If you want to experience Old Vegas the way it truly was, the El Cortez has to be your first stop. Liberal slots and probably the best Black Jack in town. Sorry if this is coming off sounding like a commercial, but Mr. G is getting older and I'm afraid the El will eventually change into just another slick money pit. We &quot;low rollers&quot; have a home just now, and for those who come to Las Vegas for the gambling instead of the glitz, I suggest you take advantage of this fine old hotel while you still can. I know we'll be back as soon as we can.	
Apr 13 2004	worst hotel i ever stayed	Its the worst hotel that i have ever stayed in las vegas. The staff never responded to anything we asked for and worst of all the hotel corridors and rooms are so worst and very difficult to find parking space. water always clogges in the bathroom and the TV never worked.	
Mar 23 2004	Want lung cancer and bad service to chase it with? The El Cortez is for you!!!	My wife, mother in law and I ended up at the El Cortez over a March weekend....college basketball and spring break bookings forced our hand, nowhere else could accomidate us.I wish we never set foot there. The tower rooms looked ok, but we were in the old building which is only slightly more appealing than a rescue mission.Between the seedy characters, serial chain smokers, spring break alkies and the steet people who seem to make the El Cortez their 24 hour shelter, it's not possible to feel comfortable for a moment there.If you have no choice but to stay in that run down, hard scrabble area, try the Days Inn across the street (Fremont Street).	
Mar 18 2004	Great Gambling	Excellent place for your gaming. Craps consistently offer $1 minimum with 10x odds. Blackjack tables have reasonably good rules. The machines have good payouts. I've stayed here three times. Don't expect great ambiance like the palaces on the Strip, but you get great hotel deals and staff is friendly. I've stayed and played all over this town for many years -- places like the MGM Grand, Mirage, Luxor, and Golden Nugget -- and find there are nicer rooms but I always seem to end up on Glitter Gulch for playing, and the El Cortez tables especially get most of my action.	
Mar 15 2004	Super deal!	I stayed at the El Cortez during the NASCAR race week 2004. Did not know what to expect because of the mixed reviews. If you are looking for a clean hotel, with a great restaurant, good casino , which is one block from Fremont St. casinos then stay here. The rates are super, phones optional, but this was a comfortable hotel. If you are looking for the glitz trip stay on the strip and spend all your money. I will stay here again!	
Mar 13 2004	The Best Casino/Hotel in Vegas	 The El Cortez is the only hotel/casino my friend and I ever stay. we spent many trips with the 4 Seasons Club. The gambling machines are almost always loose and we won our share of jackpots and shirts and jackets. The rooms have always been clean and kept that way as long as we stayed. ( I had one bad experience where I was haveing a winning streak and had $2,500 in a case in my purse and it was stolen and never found out if it was recorded on tape or not) but in the around 20 years that we were going thats pretty good. The cafe has great food at great prices and Roberta's Cafe has the best prime rib!! I have been in bad health so haven't been able to go in the last few years but when I can afford to go again you better believe the El Cortez is where we will head for our food and hotel and gambling. N. J. Thomson Long Beach, Ca. 	
Feb 13 2004	Was just fine	We enjoyed our stay. room was comfortable, food was fine, staff was great. Will stay there again.	
Jan 21 2004	Okay	Stayed at the El Cortez over the weekend and surprisingly found the facility to be okay.The El Cortez has five categories of rooms, ranging from expensive to cheap: the mini-suite (usually $99 regardless of day), the double-double tower room ($35 - $99, the latter price on weekends and holidays), the king tower room ($35-$99, the latter price on weekends and holidays), the double-double main building room ($20 and up), and the queen vintage building room ($16 and up). We got one of the uper floor double-double tower rooms. High and overlooking the strip, the view was nice. The room and bathroom were spacious and clean, water was fine, numerous clean towels were provided, and the beds and pillows were comfortable. The TV even had cable. Accommodations were definitely comparable to the large hotels on the Strip.Hotel staff was okay; housekeeping people were particulalry friendly.Our casino experience was good - saw a number of winners; one could play on the tables for a minimum bet of $2. There was also a relatively big number of 5-cent machines for those not into big-time gambling.The hotel has garage parking, so vehicles aren't directly exposed to the elements (sun and dust).We found the Immediate vicinity to be scary, but Las Vegas Blvd. and the Fremont Street Experience are only a block away, so if you're able to survive that one-block walk, you should be fine (within that one-block walk, you will find stores that sell nice souvenir shirts for 3 for $6.99, shirts that sell for $10 each on the Strip).Two things did bother me: (1) the smoke situation, which was really bad (my nose bled from the assault of smoke), though I've experienced pretty much the same thing in ALL other Las Vegas hotels (they really should have no-smoking casinos in this supposed tourist-friendly paradise), and (2) the lunch buffet at the hotel's Careful Kitty's restaurant, which at $9.95 on a Monday, was very expensive by downtown standards. (Tip: Try the food at Golden Gate Hotel's City by the Bay Diner - you can get a good and heavy meal for $3.99!)We'll definitely come back to this hotel if we can get the $35 rate for one of the tower rooms on a weekend.	
Jan 17 2004	Poor customer service	Hotel desk persons not very helpful, very young and inexperienced, reminded me of a fast food restuerant. Failed to inform me that I needed to leave a $20.00 deposit or open credit card for phone calls. Informing me of this policy at checkin would have saved me a trip to the front dest when I tried to make a local call. Desk clerk didn't even tell me how to get to room from parking garage! Too many good deals to be had in Las Vegas to be wasting your time on this place!	
Jan 9 2004	the Lowdown on the El cortez	The El Cortez is the best deal in Vegas. It's not the Bellagio. Heck, it's not even a Motel 6! But for 25.00 bucks what do you expect? The $25.00 rooms are worn, but clean. The carpets have stains but not gross. The bathrooms however are very nice snd modern. I fly in and always stay here my first night. I usually get in around midnght and I don't want to pay big bucks for a place that I am barely going to use. It's a 3 minute straight shot walk to Downtown. The next night I usually migrate up the strip where I can enjoy my room.Overall, the El Cortez is just a cheap place to crash. If you are looking for frills or to be pampered then it's not for you.--Big Rob in Portland	
Dec 16 2003	Worst Hotel ever!!	You get what you pay for. I wanted to stay here because of the history behind the hotel. Got a good deal on the room also. From the minute I walked into the hotel, it was terrible! There was not a single security person anywhere, the desk clerk was rude and couldn't even tell us how to get to our room! Had to ask several employees where our room was. Not a single person had a clue. The room was big, but the beds were box springs. The hotel was very unsafe. again. NO SECURITY seen anywhere!!! Had to call 3 seperate cab companies to pick us up to take us to the airport. Not a single one would come becuase of the neighborhood etc. Got lucky and had a cab drop some one off, had to beg them to take us to the airport. Would not reccomend to anyone to stay. Spend the extra money and stay on the srip!	
Nov 16 2003	always a great stay	i have stayed at the el cortez quite a few times and it's always great. they have vintage rooms that are only accessible by stairs and they are refurbished snd lovely (they are original rooms from the 1940's) i've also stayed in a huge suite they have on the other side of the hotel. all rooms except for the vintage rooms come with a couch and coffee table . i always find my room to be very clean and housekeeping has no problem keeping you well stocked. it's definitely 1 of the best downtown. you can't hold them responsible for the area downtown las vegas is like any other downtown	
Oct 31 2003	Cancer Capitol	From the time I walked into El Cortez I thought I was going to get lung cancer because of all the smoke. I was in there for about 2 minutes to check in and I came out smelling like an ash tray. The room was nice, but the cigarette smoke was a major problem. If you have any kind of respiratory problems or care about about your health, stay away from EL CORTEZ aka THE SMOKE OUT!!	
Oct 31 2003	Bargain	I have stayed at the El Cortez several times. The Tower rooms are roomy and comfortable. For the price, it is a bargain. However, don't go for the really cheap rooms in the &quot;old&quot; section of the hotel. I hear that they are not very nice.The staff was always courteous.
