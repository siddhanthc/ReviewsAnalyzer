Jul 31 2009 	Decent and affordable hotel in an expensive city	I researched extensively for my middle eastern trip and found accomodation in Dubai to be quite pricey in general - there is no such thing as a cheap hotel or hostel in this city. Dubai Nova is one of the few relatively affordable and decent (no noisy/sleazy nightclubs) hotels in a well located part of Dubai - still on the 'Bur Dubai' side but close to the Deira side, near the famous souks and just around the corner from Dubai museum which is worth a visit whilst in Dubai. The room was clean and adequate with satellite TV.	
Mar 12 2009 	Clean Honest Great Location	I stayed at the Nova Dubai in February 2009. I researched Trip Advisor first to get a feel for this hotel and can say that most of the reviews are correct. This is a clean, economical, well located hotel. A couple of blocks North and you are at the Dubai Creek area which has great restaurants on the river. Dubai centre is less than A$10 cab fare away (outside peak traffic). I stayed in a single room which was fine, but the only window was in the bathroom. I was on business so the room served only as a place to sleep.	
Dec 11 2008 	Ok for the price	I stayed at the Dubai Nova in November 2008 for 2 nights. It is situated in a good location, right in the heart of the Bur Dubai district. The great thing about staying in this area is that you experience 'old school' Dubai...a far cry from the massive constructions taking place at the other end of town.The room was very large and clean, but dated. The bed was extremely hard, but I didn't have any trouble sleeping. Not much natural light in the room either.The breakfast included was ok, but don't expect anything at all flash!!! I ended up just having tea, cereal and toast!The staff were ok, but at times I felt they weren't really interested in being overly helpful. I lost my mobile phone at their hotel, and they didn't make any huge effort to look for it for me.Overall, my stay at the Dubai Nova was ok. Not the flashest hotel in town, but in a very good location. Not sure if I would necessarily seek this hotel out again, but it was more than ok for what I needed.	
Oct 24 2008 	Perfect stopover budget hotel	We have recently returned from our first visit to Dubai, where we spend three nights at the Nova on the recommendation of Trip Advisor contributors. We were looking for something cheap and cheerful to use as a jump point to our onward journey to Europe. The hotel staff were very pleasant and all parts of the hotel were extremely clean. Our room was massive, with a separate anti room and bathroom, however we did not have a window. This was not really a problem as we simply wanted a clean place to stay and the shower was great. Lots of hot water and pressure. We were on the third floor and at the 'back' of the hotel so everything was whisper quiet. This is a budget hotel - however it suited our needs perfectly. The bonus for me was the breakfast. This hotel is in the old part of town ( Indians rather than Arabians), and breakfast reflected this. After the first morning of having hot milk on cornflakes we opted for the Indian - naan bread and three different curries. I was in heaven. My other half had an omelete each morning - individually made with fillings of his choice. Being situated in the old part of Dubai we were able to walk everywhere and were two minutes from the textile souks and a short water taxi (A$ 1) from the gold and spice souks. The hotel is across the road ,almost, from the Dubai Museum, which is definitely worth a visit - spend 1 - 2 hours there.	
Jun 2 2008	Great little hotel	We stayed at the Nova because it had pretty good reviews here and i must say i wasn't disappointed. the room was large and very well air conditioned, Its not 5 stars but for the price it's great.the Breakfast was ok and catered for Asian as it included curry and parathas. overall i would recommend it for the location and cheap price	
Mar 12 2008 	Great location! Great value for money!	Had never been in Dubai before and booked this hotel via internet. Turned out to be in the best of locations to explore Dubai city! It's just opposite Dubai Museum, a few minutes' walk from Dubai creek, the heritage area of Bastikayah and the souks. We got an enooooormous room. Clean. Staff were friendly and helpful. Quiet. Only downside was the breakfast. A very poor spread - BUT there is the most excellent breakfast place just two minutes' walk away - Basta café! I would definitely stay here again. A very good choice if travelling on a budget.	
Mar 1 2008 	Fantasic location	I stayed at the Nova for 3 weeks. Yes three weeks! I chose it for its price and the decent reviews I had read and not once did I regret my decision. The room was basic but clean and safe and the staff were always helpful. The hotel is located in one of the most interesting areas of Dubai, full of Indian textile merchants and near the creek and market area. When traveling on a budget you could not pick a better place to stay. I would highly recomend it to anyone looking to save money while experiencing Dubai.	
Feb 1 2008	Good value in a good location	My husband and I stayed at the Nova during a recent visit to Dubai. We needed a budget hotel--not easy in Dubai as another reviewer mentioned-- and decided to go with the Nova because we really wanted something downtown and we wanted something clean. We loved the location (although I think we were lucky to have a room not on the main street). The staff was very friendly and helpful. Internet was available at a good rate. There are different categories of rooms. Indeed, this is not a 5 star hotel. The rooms are very big and our room was not modern. However, it was very clean and was cleaned every day. We had everything we needed. Breakfast was simple, but as we were on a budget, toast and coffee or tea was enough. Remember that there are different kinds of guests and everyone's idea of what is a good breakfast is different. If you want to just hang out at a pool at a hotel, pay the extra money and go for a more luxury hotel. You can find good deals online. Because we wanted some time to do this, we decided to pass the second half of our stay in a nicer hotel. Unfortunately, in the nicer hotel we had to pay extra for things like breakfast and couldn't just pop out to get a bottle of water or a quick snack or even just a pleasant evening walk. Overall, we particularly liked the location, the fact that it was very clean and safe, and would recommend it for couples on a budget.	
Jan 16 2008 	Not a place to stay	We had tried to book the property through number of well know web-sites but couldn't got confirmation in due time. So decided to call them up and reserve it directly. They charged for triple room/occupancy but upon arrival said all the rooms are booked and we have to take double room with extra bed and no refund. When we checked in the room found it is very smelly, wash room is broken, very horrible atmosphere. Up on complain to front desk they said it is the best room they have offered to us. After waiting for two hours with my kids in the lobby they were able to show two more rooms with similar problems but little less smell. We had no choice but stayed there. We paid about $150 a night for the room but the room/hotel worth not more than $30 a night. The front/entrance of the hotel was pretty neat and good but actual hotel inside, halls and rooms are not maintained in decades. Also there were broken AC/electric switches, no iron and very creepy TV. We strongly recommend to AVOID the hotel.	
Jan 8 2008 	Not too bad	We stayed here for 3 nights and found it fine. The hotel is centrally located to shops, banks and restaurants. The museum is just walking distance. Rooms were spacious. Staff was curteous. Hotel is in a busy shopping area, but we didnt hear noise in the rooms. Breakfast was available and fresh omlette was made to order.	
Dec 18 2007	Really Disliked This Hotel	We stayed in the Nova Hotel Dubai on the 19 and 20th september. We had booked and paid for both nights however upon arriving at the hotel and finding the condition of the room to be unacceptable we left the following day and booked into another hotel. The porter excorted us to our room and I did try to keep a very open mind as I noticed that there was a curtain at the end of the passageway covering up some construction work. Hoping once he opened our door it would be better unfortunately it did not. The bedspread had cigarette burns in it - we did ask for non smoking. The room was really rundown. The bathroom had a shower rod that was held up by toilet tissue. There was a window which just looked out to a ugly wall. Construction work hammering started above our room at 8am the next morning. I could not get out fast enough. We travel all over the world and travel for up to 8 months every year and have been doing this for 3 years now and we have stayed in thousands of hotels. I am sorry this one did not work out as I do not like posting bad reviews however i though the public should be aware. thanks Julie Heady	
Nov 26 2007 	Dubai's best kept secret	Lets face it, visiting dubai is not cheap! All other hotels will run you over $200 USD (including Holiday Inn, Novotel and Ibis) Dubai Nova hotel will offer you the same service for less than half the cost! Its in a very convenient location at walking distance of the creek, dubai museum, and the gold bazar... Its also $12 USD cab ride away from all other major attractions!The hotel offers you the basics, however do not expect 5 star luxury since the installations are somewhat outdated. I felt safe leaving valuables in my room and the staff was extremely friendly and eager to please .PS. Dont forget to try the shawarmas from across the street!	
Oct 5 2007 	5* value	This hotel offers tremendous value for money and location is very good. 3 double delux rooms for 4 nights cost £534.00. Had 3 kids &amp; 1 teenager as part of party. All was content and happy throughout our stay. Hotel staff very polite and ready to help. (4th floor shower not so good as low water pressure - got moved to 3rd floor when mentioed it) Rooms were clean, spacious and we was'nt worried about valubles - some of my party went gold buying. I thought location was great. Its in Old Dubai so out of the developing mertopolis which can be a good thing and many shops within hotel vicinity seem cheaper, bought mobile fone saving £10-15. Opposite the hotel is a fantastic Shawarma place. I noticed all locals and many staff eating there. I strongly advise to try the fruit cocktail (about 30p). if they sold that here I reckon about £3.50. So so good and nothing artificial. Things to do - Desert driving, wadi water park, Burj Al arab tour, river cruise &amp; meal, all aranged from tour desk in hotel by independant staff but trust worthy. Maybe I was lucky I dont know, but I booked this place after reading the reveiws, and anybody else doing the same I would recomend this place as a good, clean, cheap place to stay for someone who wants to rest, wash and eat breakfast and leave your belongings somewhere safe. If you want a hotel that has a swimming pool, yoga classes and in general just want to hang around the hotel it self rather than explore Dubai then you may not enjoy the Nova.	
Apr 24 2007 	I recommend Hotel Nova	I stayed at Hotel Nova for four nights in April, 2007. It was my first visit to Dubai. I booked my single room on allhotels.com for $76 per night, including taxes and free breakfast.I selected Hotel Nova because it was one of the few hotels in my price range that had no bad reviews on websites, because the location looked good, and because it was within my budget.I was very impressed and entirely satisfied with the hotel. My room was very nice, and was cleaned well daily. My room had its own balcony. The refrigerator, airconditioning and hot water worked well.The staff at the hotel were very helpful and friendly. I contacted the hotel prior to my arrival, and they communicated with me by email, answering my questions and advising me. I very much appreciated this.I requested a quiet room. It appears that all of the rooms in the hotel are quiet because the hotel's outlets (shows) are in a separate building that is beside the hotel.The location was fantastic, very close to the river and the museum. I would definitely stay there again.	
Oct 16 2006 	Dubai Nova convenient and affordable	We stayed two nights at the Dubai Nova hotel at the end of September 2006. Our room was certainly not renovated, but very spacious, more like a suite. The pillows could do with replacement. The bathroom was clean and spacious. Unfortunately the fridge didn't work, but the air conditioning thankfully did. The staff are very obliging and arranged discounted tours for us. Breakfast in the morning was a buffet which included traditional and local cuisine. The Dubai Nova is a budget hotel in short walking distance to the Creek, just across from the Gold Soulks and short drive to the airport, so for us the convenience was good. Because of its proximity and cost I would certainly stay here again if on a short stay.
