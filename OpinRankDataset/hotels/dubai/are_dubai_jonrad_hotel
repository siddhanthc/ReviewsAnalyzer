Jun 16 2008 	OK for the price	We stayed in this hotel for couple of days. Polite employees, the location is excellent, right next to a big shopping mall with supermarket and food court. Nice, basic breakfast. There is a kitchen in every room, not that I cooked but it's nice to have it just in case.... The bathrooms are renovated.  The only thing I did not like is that the hotel is old and you can tell is worn out. The blankets have holes, the sheets and the towels are kind of greyish. I put away the blanket and used only the sheets…. At least they are washed more often (I hope). The hotel is excellent for budget travellers, you get what you pay.	
Mar 29 2008 	Amazingly helpful and friendly staff	Just had the most amazing week in Dubai.The staff at the jonrad hotel are just brilliant. They go out of their way to help you and make sure you have the best stay possible. Every morning the staff would clean our rooms and replace everything that had been used. Breakfast wasn’t to my liking but had enough choice, 3 selections of cereal, toast, tea, coffee, various foods.The swimming pool on the terrace is small, but it was nice to splash around in. Isn’t great for if you want a swim. The hotel has quite a nice view from the terrace, although the view from the room isn’t so good (Car park or a wall! – but how often do you spend there/looking out of the window?!) They also arranged day trips to certain shopping centers or the beach on different days which was helpful.The hotel is in an excellent location in Deira which is close to everything, shopping centre/starbucks/all food places are literally around the corner and across the road. There is a bus stop close to the hotel for you to reach most places, and boats to al nasir square where many souks are.Overall I don’t have a bad word to say about the place – I felt very welcome and would most definitely stay there again, when you check out the hotel even arrange and pay for your taxi for you.	
Feb 11 2008 	Pleasantly surprised.	The Conrad Hotel is now called the Jonrad Hotel: it is set in the busy part of Deira. The staff are extremely helpful, friendly and eager to please. Rooms are reasonable, everything works, hot water showers etc...they will provide an electric kettle along with teacups etc...free trips are arranged both morning and evening. Mornings to the beach and evenings to different shopping plazas. You can have computer usage in the main reception area for about £1.50 (10dirham) for 1 hour. Breakfasts are very good and everything is neat and tidy. They have a small swimming pool on the roof which provides a wonderful sun trap.The hotel is centrally located: walk out of the front door, turn right and then right again onto the main road which takes you straight up to the Creek which is about 10 minutes away. From there you can get a municipal water bus for 4dirhams to anywhere. Alternatively you can turn right at the creek and walk along for another few minutes to the abra station this costs only 1 dirham to go whereever you wish.We didn't visit the restaurant but I'm sure it would be good value. We tended to eat at the Panorama Hotel next door where they had a marvelous buffet (12 main dishes, 10 salads, 10 side dishes and four desserts) all for the pricely sum of 24 dirhams. You can eat as much as you like. That's about £3.50 per person and everything is excellant. The restaurant is situated on the first floor and on the ground floor is a lively bar - have fun!	
Nov 29 2007	My Stay	LONDON,UK. Olugbenga OLOTU18th Nov - 24rd November, 2007.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Got to Dubai International airport, waited for the arranged taxi from the hotel for about One and half hour (1.5hrs). Very disappointed got myself a taxi to the hotel. The receptionist sounded very carefree, and was not sure a taxi has left for the airport. He was confused and looked lost. I did not wanted to argue at this point. I was shown my room. I got to my room very tired and find out there was a leakage in the bathroom. I just wanted to sleep and take the case up the following day. I got all these sorted by another receptionist, who was very helpful and reasonable. Got moved to a decent room. The room attendants very reliable, kind and respectful willing to help and make your stay comfy. The internet connection is a dial up system in the main reception area, this needs improvement!As a guest, I was disappointed with few things - food timings, some rooms facing other property very noisy, etc. I would say you just have to be prepared to ask questions about everything really.Overall, if i have opportunity to visit again, with a restricted budget, i might use the hotel because of its location.	
Oct 29 2007 	Great 3 star hotel	Jonrad/Conrad hotel Dubia. This hotel was originally called the Conrad but had to change it's name after being open for a year thanks to pressure from the Hilton hotel who already owned the name. If you look closley you can see that the C has been removed from the front of the hotel and been replaced with a J (very strange). First impresions when you arrive is the area dosn't look fantastic ? but it is handy. Local shops include the Iranian sweet shop, several car hire agents and grocery store. Next door to the Jonrad is the Panorama hotel which is a great place to eat , 3 course buffet 19 Dirams (USD 6/GBP 2). The hotel staff are very friendly and helpful. Shuttle bus goes daily to the beach and shopping centres. Small swimming pool on the roof of the hotel is small but plesent. Tours of Dubia can be booked at the hotel.Overall if you are looking for a good 3 star hotel in Dubia this is for you. I would deffinatly go back again.	
Sep 19 2006 	Its not all bad	At first, i was i little disheartened to see the surrounding area in which you will find the Jonrad hotel (recently changed from conrad)- however when you step inside its not so bad. The staff are friendly and welcoming and the hotle is clean. Its actually in a key location in Deria so its not a bad place for a bed and breakfast. good points- the hotel is small enough to get some personal service and actually meet the other guests staying there- its nice to bump into the people who are familiar.bad points- situated near a main road and man do they like to beep the horns! the view from th window isn't great either you eaither face the extractor fans or the car park either way not great. there is a pool at the top- the deepest end is a mere 1.3 metres so not big at all!all in all, it was a really nice place to stay- if i went back to dubai- i would prob go back to the Jonrad on the service and friendliness alone.	
Apr 15 2005	do not belive in pre booking	I was the there march/april 2005 arrived at hotel approx 7.00am gmt and was told that the room was not available even though it was booked 2 months in advance i was told to sit in lobby until 2pm gmt at which time i was not even offered breakfast or cup of tea.and the manager i complained to said this is the system of all hotels in dubai that the people check out at 12 pm local time, i asked him y did the booked me and charged me for the whole day he could not answer. behind the hotel there are big electric motors runing 24 hours a day do effect persons sleep, as there is no attempt to sound proof the windows, as for air conditioners the tempreture controllers dont work so have to switch on/off manually and talked to other guest in the hotel it was same for them
