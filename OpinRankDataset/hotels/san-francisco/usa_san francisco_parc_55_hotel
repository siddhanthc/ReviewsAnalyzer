	Parc 55 let me down	I know not every one reads these all the way so if you do decide to stay here do yourself a huge favor deman a room on the club level and make sure its a corner room, these are the only rooms in the hotel that are fair. Big diff from the reg club room and the corner club rooms trust me.. This is one of the hotels that you view pics of and say wow this look nice and the price is reasonable. However the pictures are of there finest rooms. I booked 3 rooms at this hotel on the club levels. 1 Room was very large and was well laid out. However the furnishings are strait from the motel 6 catalog. Now, to the hotels defense I did just check out of a 5 night stay in Las Vegas at the Encore a 5 star and by the way most fantastic hotel I know. Our other two rooms was Dim, lacking wall coverings or art, Very bad layouts ect. Oh yes and if your planning to eat breakfast in the club or go to the club for drinks don't. Bottom line is if your looking for a quality memory of your hotel on a romantic or magical trip to old san fran do your self a favor and stay some where else. The bell hops and valet were very nice and quick. Thank god this city is so freaking beautiful otherwise I would have let this hotel ruin it for me.. Just keep looking for other hotels.	
	Nice hotel in a good location	We really enjoyed our stay at the Parc 55 hotel, it was clean and comfortable. We booked it through Hotwire and it definitely exceeded our expectations. The downsides are:- Parking was quite expensive.- Basic coffee / tea was not a complimentary inclusion.- Wireless internet was not a complimentary inclusion in the rooms (had to go to the business centre and after playing around with the set up, I gave up and went back to the room). However, the price was reasonable which made up for the above negatives.Great location - walking distance to great shopping! Would definitely consider staying here again on our next visit.	
	A lovely hotel	Judging by the reviews, I'm guessing that some guests may have stayed in an unrenovated room at Parc 55. Our room was large, clean and lovely. It was an inside room, and we heard no street noise. We also didn't have any problem with noise from the adjoining rooms. Check in was perfect. The lobby is lovely, and it feels like you are in a much more expensive hotel. I am from San Francisco, so I was not surprised by the presence of homeless people. I don't consider it to be a fair criticism of Parc 55. In my experience, the area around Parc 55 is completely safe.My only complaint is we were given a room with two double beds instead of one Queen or King. It was late and we had unpacked before we noticed the size of the beds, otherwise we would have asked for a different room. However, I was disappointed that the hotel would assign a room with two double beds to a couple.	
	Really enjoyable especially if you book the exective room levels	This was the end of a road trip around San Francisco and we really enjoyed it. I read some negative stuff about this hotel and its location, but I couldn't find it. Of course the building doesn't look nice, but all the rest was brilliant. We booked an executive room for a few bucks in addition which provides complimentary ors d'heuvres at around 6-7pm and breakfast. On top of that rooms are on the 28th + floors which results in quiet rooms with gorgeous views.	
	Great location but noisy at night	I stayed at the Parc 55 on two occasions in October for two nights each time. Each room I had was spotlessly clean and furnished to a high standard. On my request I had a smoking room so I was on the 8th floor. I obtained my room through Priceline but nevertheless my request for a corner room was granted on my first stay. I preferred to leave the window vents partially open but the noise in the street below after dark funnelled up into the room as my room overlooked Mason Street. The loudness of sirens was disconcerting but it was the shouting and arguments I had most difficulty with. I didn't want to use the earplugs provided as I was worried I wouldn't wake at 7 AM but it only became quiet outside around 3 AM. I'm sure it would make a difference according to the level and location of room allocated so I would suggest requesting a room higher up and away from Mason Street. The location of the hotel can't be beaten for access to BART from the airport as the Powell St station is just a few minutes walk away. Any hotel in this location is going to be subject to noise and I was perhaps more sensitive to it being somewhat jet lagged after a 20 hour journey when I first arrived.	
	Great Location for downtown SF	If you want a good hotel in downtown SF which is close to BART (Powell) station from airport, this hotel is it. Downtown and Waterfront are within easy walking or MUNI and Tram stops making this a great location. Can be noisy at night, even on the 18th floor as I was.	
Nov 21 2009 	Just renovation and great location!	I stay at this hotel at least 5-6 times a year. The location in unbeatable right next to Union Square, a bit noisy but I think that's what can be expected if you want to stay smack downtown! The hotel just went through a major renovation and the impression now is light, modern and open. Above average service for a US hotel. Nice gym as well. Just don't park your car here, it's 50 bucks for one night!	
Nov 16 2009 	Great place to stay!	Room was clean and spacious, hotel had nice amenties, and was in good location. Would stay there again.	
Nov 15 2009 	Noisy but great location	We had a large, well appointed room on the 19th floor so it was astounding that the noise level was so high. You could hear sirens, drag cars, police chases, etc. at all hours. The amenities include earplugs but you can't sleep with those in your ears. Also, whoever picks out the music played in the common areas must be a zombie. The music is awful, not at all soothing, loud and unnecessary. The hotel location is terrific. Close to the cable cars, BART, and within walking distance of shopping. If it were not for the noise, this hotel would be perfect.	
Nov 14 2009 	Great hotel Great location	We booked a club level king room at this hotel for 5 nights. The room was great, we had a great view of downtown, we were on the 23rd floor. The room also had a LCD TV and had a built in outlet to plug in your one AV equipment (RCA/SVideo/VGA/MP3) and watch it on the TV, great for families who might want to bring a portable DVD player. The bathroom was great, nice a big, lots of room for our toilette bags. And the room had a nice closet to hang our cloths and well as provided us with 2 robes.We also had access to the club lounge which provided breakfast every morning and snacks and desert weeknights. I think it was great... we didn't pay that much extra and always had a great breakfast. The location was great, just across the street from the Bart and Muni station and a cable car stop. And just across Market street was the downtown shopping mall. We didn't really eat around the hotel, just one night we went to the mall, in the basement food court there is a great farmers market kind of store with tons of pre-made meals. Highly recommend.	
Nov 13 2009 	never stay here ever!	Upon checking into the hotel we find out that our room we booked through expedia got &quot;bumped&quot; and the one king size bed we reserved got changed into two full size beds. Our room was cleaned the second day but the garbage, which was over flowing wasn't taken out, when we came back the garbage fell over spilling all over the floor. When we called to notify the front desk about the garbage and our discontentment with the room, all they were offering was to send a supervisor up to investigate our garbage situation that was already cleaned up (by us) at 1100 at night and were very persistent on sending someone to our room. The person who took our phone call was not concerned with our needs but rather looking to reprimand someone. We are not picky or hard to please but the hotel aspect of our trip was so bad that we felt the need to post a complaint. The rooms aren't that great, your basically staying for the location. Save your money and stay at a Holiday Inn. This is my first review of service/products, i wish it could've been a positive one.	
Nov 10 2009 	Impersonal and institutionalized.	Service was good enough, but indifferent. Blaring music greeted us as we got off the elevator, which made us want to leave as soon as possible. The manager explained the music selection and level was to wake people up - even at 10:00 p,m,? Their restaurant service was indifferent, robotic and food mediocre.The best part of this experience was the cleaning staff. We happened to be in our room when the housekeeping supervisor came by to check the rooms after they had been cleaned. She wanted to know about every little thing we thought about the condition of our room and continued to follow up when we pointed out a few neglected areas.	
Nov 9 2009 	I didn't really like it	If you can stay for less than $100/night, then this hotel is fine. There's nothing disgusting or unsafe about. However, if you are looking for a nice place to stay for $100 or more per night, I would choose somewhere else. First, on Tuesday night around 9 p.m., I called for a wake up call and no one answered. I hung up and kept calling back every 15 minutes with the same results. After an hour of trying, I called every number I could find -- front desk, conceirge, housekeeping, room service, etc. and NO ONE answered the phone. This was very frustrating. (However, I was able to place a wake up call request on the other nights of my stay)Second, I wouldn't rely solely on the wake-up call. It wouldn't ever be right at the specified time.Third, the street noise was extremely loud. I heard sirens and construction noise all day and night the entire week. As I was checking out, a colleague told me there are floor vents that are left open, but if you close them, it quiets the noise significantly. I wish I had been told I could close those vents (or if those vents had been closed in the first place.)In conclusion, this hotel is fine, but I'd stay somewhere else with all the great hotels San Francisco offers!	
Nov 8 2009 	Don't be suckered by the appearance	This is a nice looking hotel (W-esque) hiding what's underneath an old decrepit building.When I turned the tap on in tub, the water ran brown for 20 seconds.When I turned on the tap in the sink, it spewed water all over my suit.The walls are PAPER THIN. I could hear everything happening in the halls or next door (a room inhabited by a mother and her pre-teen daughter, who spent much time debating what she would wear)And for a hotel located downtown, it fails miserably in the basics for a business traveler. The business center is closed and there's no way to print anything should you need it for your meeting. The wifi on my floor kept going in and out every 10 minutes. And finally on my last morning, their internet billing system refused to let me sign up for more access.Just appalling. An utter failure.	
Nov 8 2009 	Great location and value - highly recommend	I booked this hotel at the last minute and was very happy with it. It is right across the street from the Westfield shopping center and the Powell Street BART station; quite a convenient location. The hotel itself is very modern and clean. It felt very safe, which was important to me as a female traveling alone. When I arrived I notiiced there was a conference of Ebay taking place there, and also that many pilots and flight attendants stay there. To me, that says the hotel is good, because big companies and airline employees know where to stay.I had some drinks and appetizers in the bar which were tasty and reasonably priced. The bartender served my wine with a &quot;back&quot;; a little extra portion in a seperate glass, which was nice. during happy hour, buy one appetizer and the second is 55 cents. We had the fried calamari and chicken satay and both were very good.The room was on the smaller sie but fully equipped, and the beds were comfortable. the view of the city was fantastic. The only complaint I had was that the movies on the tv were very expensive ($16.99) and the tv was hard to operate generally - I could not find the local channels at all. Also, there was a wireless internet connection in the room but it was quite slow and they charged $12.99 for each day.Overall I was very satisfied with this hotel and would definitely stay there again.	
Nov 1 2009 	Perfect location and good value	Stayed here for 5 nights end Sept in a Club room. Firstly, it was a breeze to locate and adjacent to the Powell St BART station, so no taxi necessary from airport.I couldn't imagine a better location, as its opposite Westfield SF shopping centre and right on the Powell st cable car stop and Union Square shopping district.Choosing a club room was well worth it - the views from the lounge were fantastic and friendly Sergio made everyone welcome. The breakfast in particular was really good and cheese &amp; bacon bagels with Starbucks coffee, set us up for nicely for each day's sightseeing.Overall we were extremely happy with our choice and wouldn't hesitate to stay here again	
Oct 30 2009 	The greatness stops at the second floor...or if you step outside.	My wife and I stayed a couple nights to catch Wicked and do some sightseeing. The show was great, the stay was a bit scary. The streets around the hotel are packed with homeless and the police are poorly staffed to manage them all. We decided to grab a bit close to the hotel and then walk to the show. The further we got towards the theater, the more my wife said, &quot;let's take a cab back...&quot; The hotel wasn't even the haven it pretends to be on the website. The &quot;renovated&quot; rooms are difficult to see any change. The furniture is cheap, the beds are hard, and the overall feel is cold. The pictures make it look like rich and dark mahogany, the reality is press board with light red faux cherry flat boards and furniture. No mini-fridge, and we found the previous occupants PJ's hanging on the bathroom door. The fixtures are old, the furnishings subpar, not for the $250.00 a night we paid for a King room. The club lounge, well, it was nice, but the food was not worth the elevator ride. All in all, it's a hotel that is trying to be more than it has achieved and disappointedly advertising otherwise. Stay in closer to the financial district, little Italy, or fisherman's warf.	
Oct 28 2009 	Wonderful Choice!	Great Location, great rates, great hotel! Stayed 5 days in October and was very convenient to Union Square Shops, very very convenient to BART, Cable Cars and the MUNI. Would recommend in a minute for budget concious travelers looking for a little luxury!	
Oct 28 2009 	Great location	My new wife and I spent our Honeymoon in SF and stayed at Parc 55. We had a club room located on the 29th (out of 33) floor.Judging by the pics I've seen of rooms on here, it doesn't look like the Club Room was all that much bigger than a regular room. But they are on higher floors to help keep you away from traffic noise and get's you access to the Club level which serves a continental breakfast, hor d'ouerves (sp?) in the evening and desert starting at 7pm. The hor douerves were only so-so in my opinion and seemed to be the same every night. The deserts changed nightly and some of it was very good. The Continental breakfast was rather basic, but plentiful enough to make sure everyone gets plenty to eat. Given a choice between the continental breakfast and going out to a restaurant/diner for breakfast, I'd take the continental.Given the extra cost of a Club Room, I was expecting a few more amenities like a small fridge or free internet access but overall, I can't complain as it was still far cheaper than comparable rooms at other hotels.The main draw is the location. It is right across the street from the Powell Bart/Muni Station (note: Go up the stairs to the left. The escalator will point you in the wrong direction) And you're within one block of the Powell street cable cars and various Bus/street car lines. As we were relying strictly on public transit to get around, this hotel was perfect. The hotel does tend to nickel and dime you for services that you might get for less of free elsewhere. Internet access has a daily charge. They have a mail service that charges $8 per package (in addition to the shipping cost) They have 2 computer rooms, but even those charge you per 20 minutes and charge you per page printed ($1 for B/W and $3 for color if I recall)The staff was very helpful. The concierge was able to answer all of our public transit questions. We were flying out on Virgin America. While the hotel does have computers (free of charge) set up for people to check in and print their boarding passes, for whatever reason, the Virgin America site was partially blocked making it impossible to print out the boarding passes. The front desk print out the boarding passes from their computer for us. We had the &quot;Do not Disturb&quot; sign on the door one time when housekeeping came around. Housekeeping called and said we could call them anytime and they'd come up and take care of the room.	
Oct 28 2009 	Very good choice	Pros:- Beautiful rooms, especially those on high floors with view of the city- Great location at Union Square- Well maintained and clean- Airconditioned rooms (which is not trivial in SF)Cons:- Staff isn't that friendly (especially front desk)- No fridge in the room- No safety deposit box in most rooms (there are deposit boxes at the front dest for free)Overall, a very good choice for visiting SF.	
Oct 27 2009 	Only let down by the little things	Great location, clean rooms etc but just lacking a bit of class and thought.First example is when you check in. Total bedlam if it is busy. Never enough check-in staff and because there is no roped line people just jostle for position and hope that no one tries to jump the (non-existent) queue. I'm sure it turns ugly there sometimes and all for the sake of a rope and some extra staff.I was upgraded to a suite on the 31st floor which was great. However whoever did the lighting in the rooms favours chic over practical. Even with all the lights on I could have done with a torch to find my way around. And with all that space they couldn't find anywhere to put a full length mirror? And $50 for overnight parking?!	
Oct 25 2009 	Best Location Average Facelift	I read that this hotel was given a complete remodeling in the summer of '09, so I was looking forward to brand new fancy rooms. I was disappointed- the rooms weren't fancy, but they were comfortable, which is what is most important anyway. But I could still tell the building is quite old. The location is very central to everywhere you would want to go, including just a few steps to the cable car. Stay here if you didn't rent a car, because you can walk almost everywhere. If you did rent a car, don't park in the overpriced hotel lot. Overall, If you don't pay over $200 USD (for the basic room), it is worth staying.	
Oct 24 2009 	Excellent central location	We paid 200 euro for a deluxe king room, this was two thirds of the actual price, as we got it for a reduced rate. The room was decorated really well with a wide screen tv, and the bed was very comfortable. It was in an excellent location, central to everything. Do not pay more than 200 for a room though as it's not worth it. I only have a couple of criticisms... 1). The coffee maker was bogging! So it needed a good sterilizing before use. 2). As we were staying for 9 nights we thought that they might give us a complimentary breakfast or dinner, but the manager kept telling us to call back to the desk later. I wasn't impressed by this at all. It would have been a nice touch at a small expense to the hotel. They seem to favour the more lavish guest (a lot of business people stay here, pilots and I.T. professionals) and not give the same welcoming to all their other guests.	
Oct 23 2009 	Good Overall Value - will stay again	Parc 55 has a great location. Next to the cable cars and on the base of Market Street, It's an excellent hotel for the casual vacationer. It is also 3 blocks away from Union Square, a great area for the tourist. We lucked out and got a room that isnt facing the street (11th floor) and didn't hear the street noise, except for the occassional fire truck. You can notice some things that they haven't gotten to in the renovation, such as the carpet and the service issues. Room service trays were left in the hallways for a couple of days, and carpets in the hallways were a little worn. Don't try to call concierge or service, just go down there ans ask the question in person. You'll be on hold on the phone for a while. Otherwise, its a stay again, and honestly for the value, you really can't beat it.	
Oct 23 2009 	Excellent Location - Good Value via Priceline	We stayed at Parc 55 for 3 nights at the beginning of Oct. We paid £64 per night through Priceline, which was a bargain. We were on the 11 floor and didn't have any problem sleeping. You need to remember that you are in the middle of a city, so there will always be noise!The location of this hotel is fantastic. Its in the downtown area of San Francisco, 2 blocks away from Union Square. All the shops are on your doorstep as well as the buses, bart and trams.Parking is pricey at the hotel but there is a couple of car parks within a block or 2 away.We would definately stay at Parc 55 again and we recommend eating at The cheesecake Factory on top of Macy's, Union Square on th outside patio!	
Oct 21 2009 	An excellent deal through Priceline.com	The Parc 55 has expensive parking. If I had not Pricelined my room I don't know if we would have stayed there but I am glad that we did. The staff was super helpful and friendly(including a girl named Tip). The bar was a wonderful addition to our stay, we frequented it often. The room was clean and attractive with all the amenities. Taxis are always waiting outside and the subway is a two minute walk. Not to mention the trolleys are close. The one problem is our room was hot because of no air movement. When I checked the air conditioning filter it looked like it had never been changed. I called the front desk and the promtly brought me a new one and the roon stayed cool the rest of the trip. Always check your air filter. I would definately stay here again.	
Oct 20 2009 	nice hotelgr8 location and staffcalls from room a rip off!	Lovely rooms, but some face the road and are too noisy to sleep in, esp with fire engines etc...constant noise explains earplugs provided in bathroom!Staff polite and helpful, but the calls, esp so called &quot;loca&quot;l calls, were a rip off..not explained to us by operator when we asked...£5 for a few seconds!!! Daylight robbery!! Do NOT use!!	
Oct 19 2009 	Great place if you get a good deal	We got a great deal on the Parc 55 and were very pleased. The rooms were clean, the location was good and the hotel staff was courteous. It may not have much character, but it provides a soldi's night's stay.	
Oct 17 2009 	Let down by the bar staff...	First of all, I'd like to say that generally I thought the hotel was very good. The location was great, just across the road from the Westfield Shopping Mall, and a few blocks from Union Square. The views from our room were pretty good too, even though we didn;t get a room with a premium view.All that disappointed me was the service from my one visit to the bar, which just left a disappointing taste in my mouth before leaving the hotel.Without going into too many details, they were running their Happy Hour promotion of buying one round, and getting the same again for 55 cents. On not fulfilling this, and then pouring a second set of drinks not anywhere near the first standard of the first (it was a cocktail) I was told I must have had too much to drink when I queried why the drink tasted so much different.I found not only this attitude pretty pathetic, but also in a hotel that size which charges teh price it does, to make me pay just a handful of extra dollars which would perhaps make me not personally visit again, I thought was quite disappointing.	
Oct 17 2009 	Excellent hotel with great staff	What a brilliant hotel! The location is second to none - a minute's walk from the Bart Powell station (which costs $8.10 per person from SFO). It is also right near the tram Powell line Cable Car turnaround which makes it very easy to get around the city. We bought a 7-day 'muni passport' (which costs $24 per person) which enables you to ride any municipal railway passenger vehicle within the bay area - this paid for itself within about 2 days as the cable cars alone cost $5 each way.We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights and had a 'club room' which was fantastic. We were on the 27th floor, and the views were amazing.Breakfast was also included in the 'club lounge' on the top floor which was very good. On arrival, our greeting was very friendly and helpful. The room was clean and spacious and the bed was heavenly! I would say the only improvement would be to offer free wi-fi (we also stayed at the Donatello hotel which did offer free wi-fi).	
Oct 16 2009 	Great location	Newly redone rooms, comfortable beds,some rooms with view,located close to union square shopping and muni for transportation...a little street noise...sirens...we were only on the 8th floor	
Oct 15 2009 	Great Location Nice Hotel	I've stayed here a few times over the last few years, the hotel is in a great location near all the SF shopping, the rates are great and the rooms are very nice. I would definitely recommend it for everyone.	
Oct 14 2009 	clean hotel terrible service.	We recently stayed at Parc 55 because it had so many good reviews. It was a little pricey but we went for it. The rooms were nice and the hotel was clean but as for customer service is was terrible. They charged us extra fees with out telling us so we had less to spend on fun in San Francisco. Also, when we wanted to talk to the concierge about restaurants we had to wait an hour (along with about 10 other people) because he was on a break (on a Saturday night). When I asked a receptionist to call the concierge from his break, she told me that she couldn't pay attention to me because it wasn't her job. Made our anniversary very stressful.	
Oct 12 2009 	Great Location	Had a fabulous time at the Parc 55. The renovations were spectacular. Great service. clean room. Best Location!! Short walk to all the best sites, shopping and food	
Oct 12 2009 	Great stay at Parc 55	I booked our hotel through Hotwire, so I didn't know where we were staying until after booking. Then I read reviews online and I must say that they were all over the place -anywhere from poor to excellent. So I was a little concerned and I called the hotel directly to see what our room would be like. I was told I could make a request for the type of room and location, but that they couldn't guarantee I'd get that. When we arrived to check in, the clerk said &quot;I have the perfect room for you.&quot; She was absolutely right because she gave us a corner room on the 17th floor and we had a fantastic view of the city through two huge picture windows! The room was bright, clean, large, and quiet. The shower had great water pressure and we had absolutely no complaints. The staff were friendly and helpful and the location was perfect for us. It was close to all public transportation, restaurants, and shopping. All in all, it was a wonderful experience.	
Oct 11 2009 	EXCELLENT SHORT STAY	Stayed 1 night pre cruise last month and had a great stay. Caught the BART from SFO, walked out at Powell St, turned left, walked 1 block and there it was.....very handy for our weary bodies! Room large with good view, 2 king size beds, very clean and lovely reception. Very handy for both the Union Sq shopping and the tram....always a must for the SF traveller! Would definately stay again.	
Oct 9 2009 	Great accommodations	We wanted a hotel that was in a safe area &amp; centrally located to trolley, cable car &amp; shopping. Couldn't ask for anything better. The rooms were a good size &amp; very clean. The staff was friendly &amp; helpful.	
Oct 9 2009 	Always Great	I go to SF at least once a year, sometimes twice and have for almost ten years now.Consistanly, the Parc 55 hotel is always a pleasant stay and a reasonably priced hotel to stay in. Another key factor I like about Parc 55 is there seems to always be a room available.It's not the only hotel I have enjoyed in San Francisco, and it's not the only one I will return to, but it's one of the few I can say I loved the stay, I loved the room, I love the view, the price is always reasonable (comparably) and I will be back. Try to get into one of the higher floors.	
Oct 9 2009 	Great Room 	I stayed at the Parc 55 for 3 nights after getting an excellent rate on Expedia. We stayed in a newly renovated room and it was fantastic. The room was well decorated, very comfortable king size bed, large flat screen tv and large bathroom. The Hotel is located right next to train station - which connects to the airport - which was great and there is a large Westfields Mall across the street. Within 10 mins walking distance to Chinatown and other city locations. 1 min walk to the cable car turn around. We even stored our luggage downstairs upon check out and staff were more than happy to accommodate us. Make sure you get a newly renovated room to appreciate the luxury of staying at the Parc 55. Compared to other hotels on our trip around the USA - this one topped our list - wish we could take it everywhere around with USA.	
Oct 8 2009 	Hip Clean Friendly Room	Wonderful stay, clean room, friendly staff, great bar! The Hotel is located about a block from the Cable Car ... easy walking!	
Oct 8 2009 	Great location nice room and helpful staff	We were in SF for a few days and thought the hotel was in a great location. Booked several months in advance so got a really good rate. Very close to Union Square and lots of shopping. The parking was expensive (about $50/day) but that seemed to be the going rate at most nearby hotels. The room seemed to be recently renovated and was very comfortable. I would definitely stay here again bc of the location.	
Oct 8 2009 	I really enjoyed this hotel!	The only negative thing I have to say about Parc 55 is that the elevators moved incredibly slow (lol) and the rooms were kind of small. I was expecting the small rooms though. We stayed almost on the top floor, but could still hear a little bit of noise outside. However, after sightseeing all day, we just passed out. The location was excellent, the women who checked us in and out were extremely friendly, and the hotel was nice and clean. We got a great deal on Expedia too!	
Oct 8 2009 	Great location and hotel ...front desk service however is questionable	Thoroughly enjoyed my stay at this hotel ..great location and very central to shopping, restaurants etc . The room was amazing eg View room with panoramic sight of the city lights. Was a little disappointed however with check in as when I got there, they couldn't find my booking!! Booked it online with hotel website and yet it was confusing to them! They made up for it however after standing around for 15 mins.By the way concierge was amazing - thank you crew as they managed to make reservations at my favorite restaurant the Slanted Door at the very last moment.Will I go back..absolutely!	
Oct 8 2009 	Great price in the heart of Union Square	A very nice room - couldn't beat the price. It was very convenient to be right in Union Square, but also extremely loud. There was plent of noise throughout the night.	
Oct 8 2009 	Excellent Hotel. very clean and Comfortable	Hotel very clean, very friendly staff. The room was a nice size. the bed was very comfortable. Price was Excellent for a downtown location. And hotel is walking distance to everything.	
Oct 8 2009 	If you like the sound of ambulance sirens this is the place for you!	Parc 55 hotel, near the Union Square in San Francisco, has wonderful cushy pillows and beds, but the noise level is a bit disturbing, especially when one is trying to sleep through the night. We heard ambulances throughout the day and night at different times, which was annoying.If that doesn't bother you, then the location is stellar and close to the main downtown attractions (e.g. Chinatown, Coit Tower, etc). The accommodations were comfortable and inviting, and the service was fine. We got a good deal from Priceline-$79 per night, although parking fees can add a hefty amount of money if you choose to use that service.	
Oct 6 2009 	Very nice comfortable rooms and good location	I stayed at the Parc 55 for 4 nights for a conference in July. The hotel itself is very large and seems to be have been recently redecorated so the rooms and the lobby area are trendy but comfortable. I was sharing my room (a double queen) with some friends and while the room is quite spacious there is not a lot of space to keep luggage. The hotel itself seems to be geared towards hosting conferences etc. so the majority of people would not be in their rooms all that often but rather in the conference facilities which are nice and very large. I did not get a chance to check out the other facilities such as the gym or spa but I heard they were good. The Parc 55's location is very convenient. it is in the middle of union square which has a lot of up market shopping and department stores as well as being nearby the financial district. it is very easy to travel to other parts of the city (Fisherman's Wharf etc.) by bus or tram if you can stand the wait, but otherwise it is a central point to walk to other areas such as Chinatown.	
Oct 3 2009 	Very nice hotel in a great location.	Great hotel, rooms are very well presented, clean and spacious. Check-in was smooth and receptionist was very nice and friendly (we were upgraded to higher floor room with view). Hotel is in really good location and if you drive, you can manage to see a lot as the hotel is not far from anything really.I have not experienced any noise whatsoever as some complained, but maybe it's because we were on a higher floor. There are awful lots of homeless people around the hotel though. Also, parking in the hotel is very expensive but there are lots of other places around the hotel where you can park and they are a bit cheaper.I would not hesitate booking this hotel again!	
Oct 1 2009 	Excellent In Every Way	The hotel is perfectly located mere steps from the Powell Street BART station and the cable car turnaround on Market Street. I stepped off the plane, stepped on to BART and in 30 minutes stepped into the hotel. In addtion to its perfect location, the hotel was extremely clean, comfortable and updated. The service was great as well. Could not be better.	
Oct 1 2009 	Love this hotel would stay again. Located to EVERYTHING!!	Check in was a breeze. Our room was very nice. I recommend to upgrade your room to get a better view of the city. We stayed on the 22nd floor, had a corner room and had views that were AMAZING!! Staff was very nice and helpful. Hotel was clean and didn't smell like smoke/cigarettes. Just steps from the hotel is the Visitor Center where you get a lot of transportation information, maps and help on where to go and how to get there. There is a lot of places to dine,shop and explore galleries in that area too. Cable car is 1 block away and that one takes you right to Fishermans Wharf. You really don't need your car in this city, just take mass transit everywhere and if you get the $11.00 daily pass at the visitor center it is well worth it. Yeah parking is expensive, like $50.00 a night, but we didn't mind. The hotel was well worth our stay in San Francisco and we would stay again.	
Sep 30 2009 	Fabulous Fabulous Stay!!!!	If you're thinking of a trip to San Francisco, Parc 55 is the hotel to stay in. I visited San Francisco for 5 days including my birthday and we had a great time. The staff were unbelievable and very helpful. The Concierge was wonderful and help us arranged tours of the city and Alcatraz. She also assisted us with dinner reservations at Morton's steakhouse, where the service was excellent. The view from my room was spectacular. At the heart of the shopping district, the proximity to the BART train and public transportation, the location cannot be beat. Thanks Parc 55 for making our first trip to SF memorable and enjoyable. We will definitely be visiting again.	
Sep 29 2009 	Be ready to hear your neighbor's every move	These walls must be made of cardboard. Great location. And they let us check in early. The rooms are like an 80s Ramada Inn. Great place for a deaf traveler.	
Sep 26 2009 	What a view!	We stayed at the Parc for 1 night last week as the first night of a 6 day NorCal trip. For our $71.00 rate through Last Minute Travel, we got a very nice room on the 22nd floor with a bay view. I'm not sure we would have been as happy with a lower floor and higher rate, but were very happy with everything - cleanliness, service, location - nothing could have been better. We even had a bedtime view of the fireworks at Candlestick Park - a great start to a great vacation.	
Sep 24 2009 	Hotel adequate location great	We spent two nights at the Parc 55 over Labor Day weekend. We called ahead to say we would be arriving late and to make sure that a room with a king bed, which I had reserved a month earlier, would still be ready for us. We were assured it would be. When we arrived, we were told there were no rooms with king beds available. After fifteen minutes of discussion, we were given a room with a king bed on an upper floor. I assume the upper floors with views of the city were considered upgrades. The room was clean and the bed comfortable. The hotel itself is nothing special. The reservation area/lobby is stark and bare. Not much atmosphere. There is a restaurant which has a wonderful breakfast buffet but it is pricey. The location of the hotel is wonderful..near the BART, the cable car stop, and across the street from shopping at the Westfield San Francisco Center. Parking was expensive but that's to be expected in the city. There is a business center with 24 hour access using your room key. The hotel room was clean and the location was great so I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.	
Sep 24 2009 	Average HotelGreat Location	Average large American city centre hotel.Though lobby area being updated at time of visit.Nice room great view though lots of street noise.Great but simple Thai cafe on 1st floor.Great location for the city.	
Sep 23 2009 	Wonderful Hotel - we truly enjoyed our say . . .	We stayed three nights at the Parc 55 last week and could not be happier. The location is perfect, central to most areas in SF. When we checked in we asked if they had any rooms available with a view. This was an anniversary trip for my wife and I and we were upgraded to a lovely room on the 24th floor with a fantastic view of the city. The staff was excellent in all areas. We would recommend the Parc 55 to all and look forward to our next visit to this wonderful city. When we do return the Parc 55 will be our first choice.	
Sep 21 2009 	it was okay. average	fabulous location.not so good service. not so good lobbyclean room with nice view, but that's it.	
Sep 20 2009 	Great location but expected more for the money	From the hotel's website, we expected a much more luxurious experience for the &quot;club floor&quot; reservation we paid extra for...still can't figure out where the floor to ceiling windows are in the hotel, having seen nothing that resembled the pictures on the hotel's website. Biggest disappointment was with the &quot;complimentary&quot; appetizer/happy hour. Food selection was minimal--far below what is normally offered at a boutique hotel or B&amp;B--and there was a charge for wine, which was not apparent either from the website or when making reservations. The staff in the continental breakfast &quot;club room&quot; wasn't overly friendly and began putting items away before the end of the posted hours of availability. While our room was nice, it wasn't anything special. However, the location of the hotel was GREAT! One final note...We were somewhat uncomfortable with the fact that anyone could enter the hotel and directly access the elevators, and thus room floors, without a card key.	
Sep 13 2009 	Nice hotel location ok great staff	Hotel was very nice, updated, and clean. Rooms were spacious enough. Staff was very accommodating and professional. Location could be better and was more evident at night. Only con is the large groups of airline employees congregating in the lobby make it difficult to enter/exit with luggage. Overall good hotel and would stay again for good rate on Priceline.	
Sep 12 2009 	Excellent location	I would have given this hotel five stars if it wasn't for the $44.00 a day for valet parking and $12.95 internet access. However for $99.00 a night, it made up for it.You can't beat the location. Right next to a BART Station and Trolley stop, you don't need a vehicle. Get a $11.00 day pass and it will get you where you want to go.Rooms were clean and spacious. The staff were very friendly.The noise and street people are to be expected for downtown San Francisco. You just have to learn to ignore it.	
Sep 10 2009 	great location but very noisey	This hotel is ver central to everything. Tourist infomation is just across the road and are very helpful. The reception area is up one level. The rooms are quite good and they are clean with great linen and towels. The room we were in faced the road and i should have know when they give you ear plugs that you are in for a load night. Beacuse of the location there is an ambulence or police station very close and so there are sirens all night really load so not much sleep was had. we had 2 double beds in the room and they were quite big rooms.The other downfall is the amount of homeless people near the hotel and also they did not give us a map of the area when we checked in which I think is really important for out of towners.On the plus side there is grat shopping with the main malls right across the street, and also very close the the tram and cable car. the cable car is good if you want the experience but expensive it is cheaper to pay the $2 to get the the pier then I think an $8 for the cable car. We did not eat in the hotel but the breakfast buffet look quite nice. there are great resturants around and the indian across the road is fantastic.	
Sep 8 2009 	Very central	Only stayed here for 2 nights.We caught a taxi from the airport which did not cost very much at all.The reception is up 1 floor and on arrival the hotel was spotless, and the greeting was good and efficiant. The room was very clean and spacious and it was a very quiet.We did not use any of the hotels facilities, we just used it as a base to explore.We caught a bus close by and went down to Fishermans Wharf to see the sea lions, and we also went to Alcatraz.The hotel was ideally located to explore.	
Sep 8 2009 	The best location	Booked this hotel for 5 nights on Expedia, great rate (under 500$us with taxes). The location is perfect. Took the BART from the airport. Arrived at the hotel at 2:30 PM, the only room available was with 2 double beds. After a long flight, didn't want to wait 30 minutes for a room with a King bed so we took it. We were told we could change room later in the week but never took the time to do it. The room we had was fine.We were on the 5th floor, so no view. I read a lot of bad reviews about the noise at this hotel. It wasn't that bad. Of course we heard sirens at night, but it's not a bed &amp; breakfast in Vermont, it's a downtown hotel so you should expect that.The CityPass was a great buy. the Muni 7 day Pass is a must. I would recommend Parc 55, you cant beat that location !!	
Sep 8 2009 	great location but a little soulless	We got a great deal on Hotwire for this one, so the value for money was excellent. However, the hotel itself is lacking real charme..But you couldn't fault the rooms, the amazing location, the great view or the cleanliness. I didn't get to see a lot of staff in the place, it's just huge. I would recommend the park 55 for business travellers or for shopping trips. One word of advise: There is pleanty of &quot;flat rate&quot; parking in lots just a block down the road. No need to pay 49$ a day (!) for valet. We found a place that charged 20$ a day and we left our car there- the location is so central, we didn't need the car in 3 days.	
Sep 4 2009 	Excellent location and price	My husband and I spent two nights at Parc 55. We paid under $100 a night on Hotwire and were pleased with the hotel. The room was clean with comfy pillows. Their laundry service was excellent.	
Sep 4 2009 	Good location rooms were fine	This is a very tall hotel! We had the huge fortune of having a room really near the top and as such we had fantastic views. The sunsets from the room were amazing. We had to wait a couple of extra hours after check in for a high up room to be cleaned, but it was definetly worth it.The rooms are pleasant enough, clean and do the job, nothing in particular to rave about.We have an interconnecting door and could hear the man snoring in the next room, so try and avoid this if possible.One of the best things about this hotel is it's location, it is literally on top of all the useful transport links, you arrive at the train stop from the airport and the hotel is right there. The cablecar turnaround is a 2 minute walk away as well that takes you all the way down to fishermans wharf. Also, if you are hiring a car when you are moving on from the city as we did, the big rental companies all have offices on the adjoining street - perfect! I would be quite happy to recommend this hotel as a base to see the city.	
Sep 3 2009 	Beautiful Hotel Great Location!	Stayed here on vacation for 5 nights. I got a great deal booking in advance with a AAA discount ($550 including taxes). Several days before arriving, I called to confirmed and to mention that we would be arriving on a late flight. Upon check-in, I was told that they didn't have any King rooms availalbe and was asked if a double would be okay. I mentioned that I confirmed with a late check-in several days ago and didn't really want a double. After checking with a manager, I was told that a King had just become available (at 11:30 PM!). The room (1719) was beautiful. The bathroom was large as was the rest of the room. Throughout the stay, the room was keep very clean. We didn't eat at the restaurant and didn't really use any other services as we were out most of the time. The staff were very helpful when asked for directions, reccomendations. They also printed out of boarding passes for us. The location is prime! Right accross the street from the end of the cable car line and BART/Muni transportaiton systems. Used them often. Even got to the Giants game and over to Oakland for an A's game. I would very much reccommend this hotel!	
Sep 2 2009 	Loved it --- great rooms staff and location -- will stay again	Parc 55 is a delightful hotel. Airy, large bright rooms; pleasant staff; cozy bar; good location.We came to SF for the Outside Lands music festival and stayed four nights here. Everything went smoothly -- from checkin (early, at 1:00 p.m., with no fuss), checkout (late, no charge, again no fuss), larger room than expected (corner), charming and pleasant staff from desk clerk to housekeepers to doormen.Our room, on the 12th floor, was our base for exploring and for take-out food at night. The room was very clean and well-maintained (one evening housekeeping brought a bed bolster that we never knew was missing). Large LG flat-screen TV was fine, on a credenza with multiple electronic media outlets and two cables in drawer. View was reasonable and nicely lit up at night.Loveseat/sofabed combo, small coffee table, desk and desk chair all allowed comfy seating and relaxing/snacking. Water bottles provided in room at $4.50 USD for 1 liter each were pricey: instead, run to the corner and half a block east to Walgreens and grab a sixpack of H2O. We didn't use the small coffeemaker, but ran to Starbucks and local coffee places each morning (expect 15-20 minute waits, coffeehouses stay busy).Air conditioning (internal unit) was responsive, audible but not too loud. By the way, there are vents under each window that roll open to allow fresh air in! I didn't notice these until the third day.We didn't visit the hotel restaurant but it looked elegant and the menu was appealing. There are numerous restaurants within a block or two: Indian/Pakistani, Thai, sushi, Irish, Italian, pizza, etc. (Punjab was our favorite, on the southwest corner behind the hotel.) The bartender did pour generously on our visit to the bar, and the space was welcoming with relaxing chairs and careful lighting.The Parc 55 is located near the Powell Street transport station, so it's near buses, underground, surface rail, and streetcars. Easy walking distance to shopping, museum area, Union Square, and a bit longer hike to Chinatown. Taxis are queued for longer trips.On noise: San Francisco is a busy city. You will hear traffic, fire engines, police sirens, and sometimes loud voices frequently during the day and night, no matter WHERE you stay. The Parc 55 provides a set of foam earplugs in the bathroom if needed (we didn't).We will definitely will stay again!	
Sep 2 2009 	Bed Bugs. Need I say more.	We left at 1:00 am in the morning after turning on the light and realizing it was a bed bug that had been crawling on me. The night manager and a security person promptly came up and confirmed our finding. It was awful and we will not ever return.	
Aug 31 2009 	Girl Weekend	My girlfriend and I recently stayed at the hotel for a long weekend and we were looking forward to shopping during the day and going to the clubs at night. When we approached the concierage to plan our excursions and to get suggestions for the &quot;best&quot; areas to go to shop and then be put on the guest lists at night for the &quot;best&quot; clubs for our type of music that we preferred...we were treated very rudely. We were handed a map and told if we wanted anything more detailed to go to Walgreens. When asked about clubs he had no clue as to where to go. We thought we would try later as we had a few already in mind with a different staff person, but found that the night shift to be no better and even less informed as they didn't know what being put on a guest list meant??? The staff the next day was no different and didn't even call us back or follow up like they said they would on making arrangements for us. To say we were disappointed in this type of treatment was an understatement. We ended up doing all our own leg work and research, but that is what a concierage is for for goodness sake!!!! I will not go back to this hotel although it is in a perfect location for shopping and getting to where you want to go...too bad!! But it truly is the little things that count and customer service is paramount in my books!	
Aug 31 2009 	Excellent location.	My husband and I have just spent 5 nights at this hotel. This was recommended to us by a friend, as he location is excellent for sight-seeing around San Francisco. It is situated close to trams stops, bus stops, and the cable car is just around the corner. Also, the underground is close by, meaning that the BART can be used to get from the airport, saving the expense of a taxi fare. It is close to shops , and many restaurants.We did find it a bit noisy at night -not the hotels fault, though, as the noise was mainly police and fire sirens, which seemed to go all night long!The hotel was spotless, and the room was beautifully furnished. We did not eat in the hotel, but there are so many places nearby to try. Excellent stay!	
Aug 29 2009 	Parc 55 Visited 20 months later...last minute deal	My original review was for January 2008...I had wanted to go up to SF for a couple days but was tentative of commiting to the purchase a hotel room due to the threat of a BART STRIKE...Getting into the city would of been VERY problematic. (see parking tip)Now, since my trip was Last minute (No Strike, but I was told many Bay Area people took that monday off because they expected horrible traffic issues) I was having issues making a SF purchase on Priceline with the usual hotels I like. Usually I try to pay between 80-100 = taxes..I tried the PARC 55 site which has a room for 125ish a night without taxes. I kept clicking around for specials on their site. I found a NON-REFUNDABLE special for the same room for 102 a night (two nights with taxes was 235...PERFECT!!). The hotel is close to the POWELL STATION...I knew it was SAFE, CLEAN and though VERY large doesn't feel so which is why I liked it the last time I visited. My biggest issue my last visit was the lack of consistent Internet...I actually called PARC 55 to ask them if it was more stable. They said they thought so. They also mentioned that the Internet cafe around the corner I mentioned in my last review is closed for 6 months of remodeling ( FYI)The hotel has done a remodel since I visited last. Check in is now in a much more modern area on the second floor. They let me check in early at 12pm which was pleasant since I had been driving from LA and on thr BART for 40 min . The lobby was full of people but not a long wait. Originally they were going to put me in a 13th floor room but I asked my receptionist if they had anything with a view..She upgraded me to the 23th floor which was VERY appreciated by me.Sometimes being pleasant, asking with a smile makes a difference...AlsoTheir new lobby/close by bar area welcomed the NEW York Mets...I heard this is a hotel for a lot of the teams...My room was as I remembered, big bathroom with a cimfy bed, I did like that they no longer used LATHER for products which I though were sucky on my last stay. THE INTERNET was $12.95 a day but WORKED perfectly. they had both wireless and plug in. I was VERY HAPPY!AREA COMPARISION: Since I know the city better this time around I can confidently tell you that this location is WAY better then the Union Hilton and Hotel Nikko. Though they are only a block away sometimes you can feel it in a city such as SF. Plus both those hotels looked SOOO BUSY.**PARKING TIP: Go to the BART SITE, buy an extended parking permit ($5 a day,not 24 hours) Then take the BART into the city. Parking in SF can be 35-50 a day depending on the area. 3 days of parking (15) + a roundtrip from pleasanton (10.55) was = $26 bucks...Also If it is a three day weekend, that Monday parking is free! ***Dining. Hotel is super close to a SUBWAY, WALGREENS (buy water), COLDSTONE, PIZZA PLACE within a block. There is a nearby Chinese Resturant. My fave is PUCCINI &amp; PINETTI off Ellis and Cyril Magnin..GREAT happy hour ($3 champagene but not boozy.	
Aug 26 2009 	Review with cheap tips for travel on a budget	Location:My girlfriend and I decided it was time for another San Fran trip. We love the city and this time we booked a week trip through a website traveling service. The building outside reminds me of the 70s, i love the look. Although i was paying more attention to the bums about to aggresively panhandle me like they did the entire week with their gimmicks for a buck or two. Although everything else about the area rocks, stores, union sq. and bars! The Old Siam across the street is the best Thai ive had in a long time. Dont bother going out late at night for the bars unless your a big dude or you have a load of friends with you, the bums out there are on full force and stop at nothing to get your attention (typically black dudes are the aggresive ones by my experience).Room: The room was whatever.. just a plain typical room on the 16 floor. The bed was really comfortable but thats not saying much since i still sleep on a 12 year old bed at home. The view was amazing! but you have to pay a lil extra to get the best sides. There is no fridge that is free or even a small microwave so all our leftovers always went fast. The shower was blah and high pressured. the drainage was HORRIBLE .. before you know it you were standing in 4 inches of water and a load gurrggling sound of the drain desperate to make way for the dirty water. gross! Also NO FAN! it would mug up the entire room and the window would fog.. but one plus is in the morning the people in the next hotel over sometimes wake up and look out the window naked and they are usually care free european tourists.. thats a plus or a minus really.. lolService: It was fine.. cept this one asian lady at the counter didnt know how to work our room phone and said &quot;ive never seen the phones in the room&quot;.. wowValue: the nightly rate was pretty good since its a recession but DONT BOTHER parking your car in their lot.. 1. you cant get the car yourself (valet and that means tip) 2. it now costs 44-49$ each night!.. there is secure parking garages all up and down union for much cheaper.. just got to walk a few blocks.. Dont bother getting their expensive room service breakfast or buffet.. since there is way cheaper restuarants down the street that serve breakfast. Their bar is really expensive but the bartenders are really cool.. there is a few bars right outside Parc 55 and a liqour store down a block.. IF your trying to thrift it out in san fran.. oh and their is wireless service for free at various coffee shops in the area DONT bother with the 12.95 per 24 charge in the hotel.	
Aug 26 2009 	Great location and very nice room	We had great rates from the internet $87 a night. Hotel located next to the Powel ST BART station so it was super easy to get from the airport to the hotel, no taxi. Rooms were fine, 7th floor but view was on a side street. No big deal though as we used the rooms for sleeping and resting not looking. Made no use of any of the facilities other than the room. Always ate elsewhere But did have free internet even though the website indicated it was $12.95 a day. Location right next to the begining of Powel-Mason and Powel-Hyde cable cars. Plus one block over was able to catch most buses needed to go to other parts of the city. Area appeared quite safe to us, a block or 2 from Union Square so lots of restaurants. Chinatown within walking distance, not short walk but walkable. Really could ask for much more.	
Aug 25 2009 	terrable	our room bathroom smelled of mold and mildew. the carpet was dirty and crums on the carpet floor. I complaned to the front desk . No change. The airconditioning was also sub par. We could smell what they were cooking in the kitchen thru the aircondition ducsWe would never stay at this hotel again	
Aug 24 2009 	Even the Housekeepers are Extremely Friendly!	Choose this hotel as it was newly renovated and found a great rate on their website for a club room on the 28th floor. I am writing this while curled up on a little couch in the bath robe they provide while looking at my spectacular view over the city and bay! The lobby and rooms are very nicely done and the staff are extremely friendly. You expect the Bell Hops, Front Desk and conciege to be friendly but here even the housekeeping staff is extremely friendly. Also great central location!	
Aug 23 2009 	Excellent stay at Parc 55!	We stayed at Parc 55 for 2 nights while touring San Francisco and had a wonderful stay. While it is 2 blocks from Union Square, there is a trolley, street car and subway station literally outside of the door! There are also numerous shops and restaurants making it an ideal location. The hotel is newly renovated and we were very pleased with the cleanliness and spaciousness of the room. We also went to the hotel bar one of the nights and had a great time - service was great. We were able to get a great deal on Hotwire ($89 a night) - for that price, this hotel cannot be beat! I would recommend parking in another location, since they charge about $50 a night (we found a lot right down the street that was $25 a night).	
Aug 21 2009 	Thoughtful amenities and accommodations yeah if you pay	It is an OK hotel, the location was awsome. I like the Amenities and Accommodations they list on the website, basically every single one you have to pay for, you want a fridge, you have to pay for it, internet, you have to pay for it every 24 hours. Parking, even if your a guest you have to pay for it, $44 for 24 hours, as a guest. If you want to rent a movie,basically it will cost $12 for it to watch once, if you accidentally change the channel you will lost it and would have to pay again to watch it. It was totally rediculous, I'm surprised we didn't have to pay for air we breathed in the hotel. If you like wasting money for no reason at all, this is the Hotel for you.	
Aug 16 2009 	One of the best hotels we have ever stayed in!!	The views from the rooms were spectatular. They even do regular window cleaning. Experienced one while we stayed. The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. We stayed on the club level and loved it. We had a 76 year old traveling with us and a 5 year old and the staff went out of their way to accomadate everyone. The bathroom had a bar for the elder to hold on to and the staff provided our son with special desserts for his taste. We would definetely stay here when we go back to San Francisco. We liked it so much that we booked a room to stay before we departed for home after traveling to other cities. The rooms were very clean and we don't have any complaints at all. We were on the 30th and 31st floors and their wasn't any noise of the night.	
Aug 9 2009 	Avoid the bellhops at all costs!	This is a lovely hotel with nice rooms, easy access to all the tourist spots in San Francisco and some of the worst service I have ever experienced. I am a regular traveler, staying in hotels about once every other month or so for several days, and I have stayed in several other hotels in SF that are rated the same as the Parc 55. The biggest difference between these hotels is that the Parc 55 really doesn't seem to value customer service. There was a convention going on during my stay, but from what the staff said there is usually a convention going on. This might have had an effect on my service, but if conventions are a regular event, then I doubt the service improves much from week to week.The good: I got a Club room on the 29th floor and the room and view were beautiful. The breakfast was delicious and varied and I was very glad I upped my reservation for this alone. The bad: The service in general was awful, but be especially wary of the bell staff. When I first arrived my luggage was loaded on to a cart and taken up to meet me at the 2nd floor registration. During the 5 minutes of travel time a small bag containing cash and other valuables went missing. When I pointed this out I was asked to check my car, person, etc. to make sure I had not misplaced it. I did and the bag was just gone, but I know for a fact it was on the cart. This was dismissed by the staff when I brought it to their attention and I was not even offered an apology. Then, on my last day, I had a bellman up to my room to collect my bags and AGAIN during the trip from my room to the bell staff area downstairs THREE items were lost. I was again told to check my room, person, etc. to make sure I hadn't lost these items. Unlikely, as the missing items were a fedora hat, a foam pillow and a t-shirt that was on the pillow. I did as I was asked, but my items were nowhere to be found. I was then berated by a bellman who insisted that I had lost the items on my own. I asked repeatedly for the bell staff to check the service halls and elevator for my missing items, but I was told they were not there. I spoke with managers, bell staff, housekeeping, everyone they could shunt me off to, but no one was helpful at all. I finally had to leave without my items, but I took the names and phone numbers of those involved. I called the next day and spoke with another manager who SHOCKINGLY said, why yes, those items are sitting here in our lost and found. I had to drive nearly two hours to pick them up because the hotel refused to mail them.I will never stay at this hotel again for obvious reasons, but if you choose to do so PLEASE DO NOT USE THE BELL STAFF!!! FOR THE SAFETY OF YOUR LUGGAGE BEWARE!!!	
Aug 9 2009 	Great location and lovely hotel	The Parc 55 was a perfect choice for several days of touring in San Francisco. We were able to get the hotel on Priceline for a very good rate several weeks before traveling. We arrived at the hotel a little after noon. Although the room was not ready this early, the staff gladly kept our luggage as we ventured out for the local sights. When we returned in the evening, we were excited to find ourselves in a corner room (panaramic view) on an upper floor. The view of the city was amazing! The hotel has been recently redecorated in a very trendy style, and the beds/furniture are very comfortable. The location cannot be better....right next to BART, MUNI, cable cars, shopping, etc. There is construction across the street, but the noise from this is not a problem unless you plan to sleep really late in the AM. Also, some other people complain about street noise at night, which is to be expected in the heart of the city. However, it never kept me awake. I would definitely return to the Parc 55 on future trips to San Francisco. The location is ideal, the rooms are large and comfortable, and the staff is helpful.	
Aug 8 2009	Excellent!	This is my second time staying at the Parc 55 hotel and will not be the last. I love this hotel it is my favorite. The service is great, everyone is helpfull. One night the ladies at the front desk got my sister and me on the guest list for Infusion Lounge, to which we had a great time. Our stay was very pleasant, the service was great all around from the valet, technical support, guest service to bell service.	
Aug 8 2009 	Convenient downtown hotel	Close to Powell St BART station with easy access from the airport. Quick check-in. Overall friendly staff thoughout my stay. Room was spacious and appeared to have been recently remodeled. Side chairs were pretty but not comfortable. Roomy bathroom. Great bed. Nice size closet, but limited size on the room safe...could not get my laptop inside. Internet connections for a daily charge. Plenty of good eating options nearby. Barbary Coast Coffee on the corner for breakfast and people watching. 5th floor room facing another building under construction. Very noisy during the day. That convenient location does translate into noise in the evenings too with BART trains and sirens and general traffic noise.	
Aug 7 2009 	Good experience	Overall I can recommend the Parc 55. Great location, typical business class hotel with usual amenities, room in very good condition, staff very helpful. Our check-in experience was excellent. Notice a number of flight crews staying here, which I took to be a good sign. The only negative was the street noise on Cyril Magnin. It gets a fair share of traffic, and since SF drivers seem obsessed with horn-blowing, you'll get that in your room if you overlook the street, along with the usual big city sirens, trucks and such. I had no problem going to sleep or staying asleep, however, so, I would have no problem staying here again.	
Aug 7 2009 	great hotel	Had a great time at this hotel. Clean, spacious,quiet and friendly.	
Aug 7 2009 	Great value great location.	I was in SF for a conference and got a great rate at Parc 55 through priceline. For $100/night, this was a great value.The Good:- Fabulous location. One block from the Union Square Cable Car stop, 2 blocks from Union Square, 5 blocks from the Moscone Convention Center.- Room was clean, spacious. Had a double with two full beds.- No functional problems with lights, heating/cooling, internet.The Not-So-Good:- Our room wasn't ready when we arrived at noon (completely understandable). I was told by the attendant that a room had been set aside for me but needed to be cleaned; I should return at 3pm. When I returned at 3pm, I was checked in by a different attendant, who informed me that the first guy had never tagged the assigned room for cleaning, so the room was still not ready. After a short wait, however, she was able to find another room for us.- They have a limited number of small storage lockers in which guests can lock their computers when leaving luggage on your check-in or check-out day. However, if all of the lockers are already taken, they would not take the responsibility of checking my computer bag, and I was stuck lugging it around hilly SF on my check-in day while waiting for my room to be ready. I made sure to check my computer bag early on my check-out day to avoid a repeat of that situation.- No minibar/fridge. Very small in-room safe. Very limited drawer space, though the closet was sizeable.- it's never a good sign when the hotel purposely provides earplugs in every room. Having read the prior reviews about thin walls, the sight of the earplugs was worrisome. However, I never had any problems with noise during my stay.The Just-Plain-Weird:After an extensive recent makeover, you would think that this reasonably handsome hotel would try to exude a cooler vibe. Yet, on my various trips through the main lobby area, my ears were greeted by songs like the theme from Footloose. While I don't mean to insult Kenny Loggins, it just seemed odd for a hotel in an enviable location in a chic city - nothing wrong with this, just odd.All in all, I'd stay there in a heartbeat if I could get a similar rate. Not sure I'd stay there at the advertised rack rate.	
Aug 6 2009 	Pretentious and expensive but great location	The hotel is in an excellent location in Downtown San Francisco. It's posh and elegant, and staff are well dressed and pretentious (but friendly). The rooms are modern and well decorated with lots of space. There's an excellent Thai restaurant in the hotel, and a trendy bar. The hotel is pricy and parking is expensive, like most hotels in downtown San Francisco (we parked our car in a nearby multi-story parking garage for less). This is a great place to stay if you want to feel trendy and hip, and the rooms offer great views of the city.	
Aug 5 2009 	Elegant convenient location great service all at a low low promotional price.	We planned 4 days in San Francisco, but could only stay at the Westin St. Francis for the last 2 days because they were booked, so we stayed at the Parc 55 for the first 2 days. The hotel far exceeded our expectations and we found the Westin St. Francis far less comfortable and elegant. This 1010 room hotel has been renovated to a very modern theme (not my style) though, peculiarly, did not have a dresser. Our 23rd floor room was large and comfortable with breathtaking view of downtown and the bay. The location is a very short walk to the F line street cars that can take you to the ferries and Fishermens Wharf along Embarcadero for only 2 dollars (75 cents for seniors). Nearby are numerous restaurants for a fast breakfast at moderate prices. Were sorry that we couldnt stay for the full 4 days but we had already prepaid the Westin St. Francis, which turned out to be less than the elegant hotel we expected.If you are going to visit San Francisco, you should check the rates at Parc 55; you may be pleasantly surprised that this conveniently located, upscale hotel is offering very low promotional rates.	
Aug 4 2009 	Not Bad	This was a nice hotel. The rooms were nice and the staff was very professional. My only complaint was the price of the parking but I'm not sure that there was anyway around that. There was some noise from the street (I was on the 7th floor) but it wasn't unbearable. The ice machines didn't work and that was bothersome since I had a sick grandmother in the room with me. Also the vending machines were out. All in all it wasn't a bad stay.	
Aug 2 2009 	Perfect location nice hotel	This was a nice hotel located in Union Square. Perfect for transportation as BART station &amp; Cable car stop was located right by the hotel. Made traveling around San Fran very easy, and it was nice hotel to kick back and relax when returning from a full day of touring. The only downside is the restaurant/bar at the hotel is VERY expensive. Stay away from it. We were very disappointed how much they charged us for our drinks.	
Jul 29 2009 	Perfect Location	Stayed at Parc 55 in one of their double club rooms. The front desk staff were incredibly helpful and allowed us to check in early which was great after a long long flight from Australia. The room was huge with 2 full size queen beds, cable tv and a great bathroom. Rooms were always incredibly clean and towels and amenities replaced daily.The location of the hotel is FANTASTIC. The cable car is right outside the hotel and Westfield Shopping centre only a 2 minute walk. Heaps of restaurants and other shopping within very easy walking distance. Staff at the hotel were always very helpful and willing to do whatever they could to make our stay more comfortable. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone.	
Jul 21 2009 	This was a beautiful and comfortable place to stay.	I came to this hotel fearing the worst. With some reviews I've read, it wasn't supposed to be good, but it was far better than I thought.I'll mention four things I noticed that others may want to know.First: Service. When we checked in, the first lady I met wasn't too friendly, and I feared the worst. Having been there too early to check in, I went into the city to sight see before coming back to check in. The second lady I had was very nice, welcoming, and interactive. Many of the staff I had encountered from then on were exactly the same. Even in the morning, the house cleaning lady was very persistent to clean our room (Someone took our Do not Disturb sign) but that was a nice sign too. Second: noise. My response, &quot;What noise?&quot; yeah, there was the sound of traffic outside, but it wasn't too bad in my opinion. Given I was on the 10th floor, it shouldn't be too bad. On lower floors I can see it being a problem, and they know that too. That's why they provide ear plugs in the restroom. You could possibly ask for extra pairs if needed. The only reason my friend needed it was in the morning when the building next door was doing construction work. There was a crane outside our window! haha that's the only bad thing that we noticed noise-wise though. Walls aren't as thin as others claim. The hotel was pretty busy but didn't have any bothersome sounds through the floor, roof, or walls.Third: Area. If you're a music lover,then you'll be happy. The hotel is roughly 4 blocks (don't quote me on that) away from the hotel. My friend and I walked to the concert hall 45 minutes before the concert, and got there 15 minutes early. The area has a few interesting characters, but we did notice that the BART police and SF police did patrol the area and so we felt fine.Fourth: Look. The outside doesn't look like much (to me anyway), but on the inside it is beautiful. The bar and restaurant area is a beautiful area to hang out and relax, and the staff there is very attentive. and here are a few prices you may want to know:The water in the hotel room are $4.50 + tax, and they're 1 liter. The internet costs roughly $12 and it is good for 24 hours.Parking is roughly $55.and they put a $50 deductible on your account when you check in (as many hotels do)Also, any purchases at the bar (I'm not sure about the restaurant, but it should be the same) are charged directly to your room, so no need to fuss with money at the moment. You just enjoy your time.All in all, it was a fantastic stay. I certainly enjoyed myself, and I plan to come back again.	
Jul 20 2009 	Great Hotel	The perfect hotel with a great location. Clean room. Great staff	
Jul 20 2009 	We love this place!	My wife and I had decided to spend an 8 day vacation in San Francisco, May 30 -June 6, 2009. The Parc 55 was part of a flight-hotel-rental car package she found on Priceline. We cancelled the rental car after finding out how expensive parking in SF was, and honestly, we never missed not having a car! The cable car stopped just around the corner from the Parc 55, and other public transportation was just steps away. The staff at the Parc were very friendly, and I cannot say enough about Rieki (spelling?), the concierge, who knew the city and it's public transportation system so well. She was great! We felt safe and relaxed during our entire stay at the Parc. Our room was spacious and compfy!I had a medical emergency on our third night. My wife called 911, and while the EMTs were on their way, Gene from the night security staff, came right to our room to assist in any way possible. Both my wife and I were panicking, but Gene, the front desk staff, and the EMTs were all super helpful. (Thankfully, the medical emergency ended up being a minor issue, and all went well.) Our only complaint is that our room check in was to be at 3 PM, but it was another two hours before our room was ready. At the time, my wife and I were beat and I had dozed off on the couch across from the front desk. Other than this minor issue, staying at the Parc was a positive experience and filled our needs perfectly!	
Jul 16 2009 	Parc 55 is a "no brainer" sincerely	Stayed at Parc 55 for a week between July 4 and July 11 and my wife and I were treated like &quot;part of the family&quot;. On arrival night (at around 9 PM), they gave us a junior suite on the 5th floor. Pretty convenient, but we wanted at first to be in an upper floor. Since it was the 4th of July, the lady at the front desk told us to come back the next day and they would take care of business. That's what happened and we moved to room 1701. Plenty of windows, great views of the city of San Francisco, and well furnished. Place was really quiet in both rooms we were and really nothing at all to complain about.Staff was first class and always ready to give you a hand. Besides, it's really difficult to find a hotel as &quot;central located&quot; as this one. You just have to cross the street to be at Powell St station (with the BART system coming from the SFO airport and going back to it for around 16 $ roundtrip). Same thing for the MUNI system and the trolleys... almost right at your footsteps!If I had to do it again, I would do the same way I did a few months ago when I made my booking through Expedia. And even if I have read a few negative comments about this hotel on this website, I can honestly attest that Parc 55 Hotel is a great place to stay and make the most of what all the magnificient San Francisco area has to offer!	
Jul 13 2009 	Lot of noise and reservation group 	I was part of a group of over 300 staying at the hotel. We were given a gaurenteed rate, however the reservation group did not have the info from the sales group and they tried to charge me double. We were also told that a depostit at check in would be $50 per night booked, check in stafff insisted on full cost of stay. The rooms are noisey. If you say anything to the staff the answer is &quot;we provide earplugs in the bathroom&quot;. Insulated windows might be a good investment for this hotel. The chairs in the newly renovated room were very uncomfortable. Maid service failed to show up one day of the stay. The supervisor asked if I wanted someone to come out, I said yes, but I needed to get ready to go out and asked for after 5 PM, they arrived at 4:30 disrupting my plans.	
Jul 13 2009 	great time	My wife and I stayed in San Francisco over the 4th. Parc 55 was an excellent hotel in a great location close to a huge mall and public transportation. Really good restaurants and Union Square are within a couple blocks. They gave us a huge corner room on the 23rd floor with windows galore. We will definitely stay at this hotel when we go back.	
Jul 12 2009 	Very chic modern hotel in a great location.	This hotel just went through a re-model and was formerly a Marriott property (it's now independent property). The lobby and reception areas are both very nicely done. The lounge is a great place to relax, enjoy a drink and some appetizers (the food was excellent, if not a little short on portion size).The rooms are nicely done for a hotel in this price range, but not extraordinary.The workout facility is fairly well equipped with multiple treadmills, bikes, steppers, free weights, and machines.The hotel location is great, as it's located right across the street from the rail system as well as a large mall (should you want to do any shopping or need to pick up some essentials).Overall, I'd give this hotel a solid B+ or A- for it's price range and even though it is not part of a chain (where I could get points), I'd strongly consider it if I were to go to SFO again.	
Jul 11 2009 	Great location great beds but laisy maids!!!	Maids were not on par with the hotel level.Everything else was great. Also good service at the hotel bar and tasty food at the restaurant.	
Jul 8 2009 	Thin walls nice location..	Extremely thin walls in this hotel, you would think people in next door would be living with you all the time ! We were glad to have nice, almost quiet people in next room, horrified thinking if some youngsters would have been there...Otherwise service ok, nothing spectacular in there. Breakfast buffet small but worth the price. Nice location, but those walls....	
Jul 8 2009 	Great experience - great hotel	Great hotel with a great staff. Everyone employee went out of their way to be helpful and friendly. Room was modern and comfortable with a great view and a fantastic bed. Ate in restaurant for dinner one nice - pleasantly suprised. Great food and good service. Price and location can not be beat. This will remain our homebase in San Francisco. Maybe the best hotel experience I have had in last 5 years.	
Jul 7 2009 	Very nice great location	Hotel was very conveniently located for the convention center as well as area shopping, restaurants, BART, and the cable cars.Check-in was a breeze. Our room wasn't ready (due to morning flight) but we were able to store our luggage and go out to eat. When we returned the room was ready. There are plenty of elevators, so never had to wait long, even after returning from a conference event with many people. The rooms are clean and well styled, with lots of comfort (5 pillows on the bed). We did have an early morning fire alarm (4:20 a.m.) - they are loud. The security staff quickly investigated and sounded the all-clear.I would avoid the hotel restaurant - there are many places to eat in the area with better selection and value. But we had a great time staying at the Parc 55. We took BART from the airport to Powell St, only a block away, and also located there is the cable cars if you want to go to Fisherman's Wharf.	
Jul 5 2009 	Wonderful Weekend with Parc55 as our home base with "No Worries"	Overall, we were more than happy with our stay at this hotel.Our weekend started out rockey, cancelled flights, placed on stand-by, missed a lunch cruise but, our stay and weekend was perfect.We stayed at Parc 55 this past weekend for the 3rd and 4th of July 09. This was our 4th wedding anniversary. Deciding to stay at Parc55 was decided after a few calls late night calls to the hotel with questions, and each time we were transferred to the front desk staff and based on the helpfulness of this staff I booked two nights. The questions I asked were not just hotel matters but, on items such as getting around and things to see and do. They made recommendations for Breakfast, Lunch even Dinner, none of which disappointed us. Although they will not grant early check-ins, I was told that I could check bags with the Bell desk for keeping if we were going sightseeing until we checked-in. We arrived back later that afternoon (Friday July, 3) at the front desk and to my surprise the hotel had upgraded us to a premier view suite with a balcony on the 30th floor due to it being our wedding anniversary. The room was five stars all the way with everything down to the Turkish bath robes to the King bed with feather pillows with chocolates. The front desk person was one of the most pleasant people I met during our entire stay in San Francisco. The people at the front desk really took the time to provide the care that is not often found with a large hotel especially when they cater to a large volume of business from airlines and conventions; CISCO was having a convention at the time. Although I was extremely satisfied with the staff of the front desk and bell desk and quality of the room...I cannot say the same about the hostess and host in the Cityhouse restaurant / bar, our waitress was wonderful. I typically wear Jeans and Polo shirts with jogging shoes and can afford to dress however I like and have no need to impress anyone, the Hostess especially, made us feel like I she was advising us that I may not have enough money to eat or drink in their restaurant and could I afford it? The Host just ignored us than looked the other way and walked away almost offended? Go figure, Ill spend more on lunch than he makes in a week. We chose to have a couple of glasses of good red wine and eat at one of the upscale restaurants in town.I am giving this hotel a 5 star because the view from our room was wonderful, the staff, excluding the hostess / host in the restaurant, were first class and the beds were amazingly comfortable. Also, the location the location could not be better. The F-Line electric buss go to Fishermans Warf and the Powell- Hyde cable car line is across the road which gives access straight to Union Square (only a quick walk away anyway) right down to the piers on the waterfront for $5 a ride (if you are in San Francisco more than a day buy a mutli-pass 3day ticket its $18.00 it is not sold on the cars only at a ticket window). Tourist Information office is just adjacent to it too, as is the giant five floor shopping mall with many upscale stores in it. Going to and from the Airport is a fun ride on the BART for a round trip cost of $16.00 and takes about 60 minutes. The BART Station is a block away from the hotel.This will be my hotel of choice whenever we are in San Francisco. Had a great time and wonderful value.	
Jul 3 2009 	Great spot will stay here again if in San Francisco	Took my girlfriend to San Francisco which is where I was born and lived till 1997 (i had not been back to the city since 1998). I think this was the Renaissance Park Hotel when i was young, or something to that effect. But its a great hotel. Perfect location, right next to the Powell St. BART station which is super easy from SFO or Oakland airport, right next to Cable Car and F Market streetcar line, it is easy to get anywhere from here -- i recommend getting one of those City Passes for $59 that gets you free admission to the Muni and to attractions around the city, you'll use it for sure.The check in when i was there was still on the 2nd level, my understanding was they were weeks from moving it back down to the main floor. Looked like they were close to completing the renovation. The rep at check in was kind enough to give us a view room - we got a tremendous deal on Priceline, 3 nights over Memorial Day holiday at $69 plus tax per night! Incredible! She gave us a corner room that had windows all around it. The view was gorgeous, and really showed my girlfriend the city. The bathroom is nicely appointed and super super clean. I noticed what attention to detail the housekeeping has here. This was in every bit a 4-star plus hotel and it provided me with a great trip. I will hope to return to Parc 55 Hotel next time I stay in downtown SF.	
Jul 3 2009 	Great hotel	I got this hotel through Priceline for under $100 - what a bargin! Its right across from the BART - which made it easy to get to and from the airport. Located right in the middle of Union Square, you're close to all the shopping. The hotel was recently redone and the rooms and common areas are very nice. They gym is small, but has the necessary equipment. I just wish it had a hottub!	
Jul 1 2009 	Tried and Tried again...	I recently stayed after getting comped a room because previously the hotel was overbooked and didn't have my room. After finding another hotel the previous trip, I called and complained and they were very good at remedying the situation and giving me a free stay while back in town.The wait times at the front desk are long. The hotel key maker wasn't working so after several trips up and down to try and get it fixed we just waited it out. The door staff etc. were friendly.There is no pool so this hotel isn't very good for young kids, but the location is great for shopping and seeing downtown.	
Jun 30 2009 	Go Somewhere Else!	Stayed 2 nights. Very close to BART and Muni. A/C didn't work, tv reception was not clear, very, very thin noise and they didn't disclosue nearby construction. Most expensive room I'd ever sweat in as I paid over three hundred dollars for saturday night and not one sorry.	
Jun 30 2009 	Nice hotel Great Location Horrible Customer Service	A friend and myself checked into the Parc for a 5 night stay while in San Francisco for leisure travel. The hotel itself was gorgeous, when we walked in we were impressed at how nice and contempory it looked. I had stayed there before and noticed how nice the upgrades looked. A friend who lived in SF came to visit our hotel and noted how 'swanky' it looked. We checked in with no problem. The room was gorgeous, plenty of towels, large, clean bathroom. I used the gym and was impressed how nice it was. Very modern equipment, lots of free-weights, machines, and workout balls, ect. Our only issue was with customer service. We called the contiegre and left a message and they never got back to us. We wanted a shuttle to take us to the airport, but we were leaving very early. We then asked the belldesk and they told us no shuttles ran that early. Little did we know that plenty of shuttles ran 24 hours and would pick you up wherever. And cost less than the one recommended by the hotel. It would have been nice to be told than instead of given attitude. We also asked for directions to Golden Gate park and the bellhop was very confusing. Instead we went down to the service area and they were able to tell us how to get their quickly and even gave us a map! We also ate at the restaurant. It was very overpriced, mediocre, and we were seated by an overly romantic, PDA couple. Watching them made me want to vomit up my entire dinner. In conclusion, great place to stay if appearences are what matter and you don't want to talk to the employees.	
Jun 29 2009 	Great Hotel	The Parc 55 just completed thier $30 mil renovation and it really shows how well the rooms and lobby area really is. Wonderful staff with easy check-in check-out, we did leave the housekeeping a nice tip for the quick turn down service each day. The high floor rooms need time to cool off, but if you close your curtains and remember the sun does shine during check-in at 2pm it all cools off by the time you arrive back from dinner in the evening. The hotel location is great and I would return again for the great rates and wonderful rooms at this hotel.	
Jun 29 2009 	Nice hotel decent price	The service was friendly and adequate. Nothing spectacular but nothing to detract from the experience. The room was nice but the giant treadmill in the corner was a big eye sore and waste of space. We had the corner &quot;view room&quot; and the views were spectacular. Very comfortable beds. The bar and restaurant are very nice.We did not have an issue with the walls being thin and they did not charge a $100/day deposit to my card as other reviews have mentioned. The noise from the street on the 29th level was very loud. I could not imagine being on the lower levels.We spent most of our time at Fisherman's Wharf so the travel back and forth was a hassle. The F-Line can be difficult to get on to return to the hotel due to high passenger volume. If you intend to spend most of your time at the Wharf, I'd suggest getting a hotel closer. A cab ride from the Wharf to the Parc 55 is only $9-10 (not including tip).	
Jun 29 2009 	Terrible Hotel	Internet is not working, and walls are thin -- if you are looking for a place to rest and sleep after a long day walking around SFO, this is NOT it!I have to admit that the location is amazing. It's 2 minutes from Powell BART station; hence, I can see a lot of businessmen and airline crews here. The room was clean, but the walls are way too thin. In a downtown area, you need pretty thick walls to block the noise out there. This decreases your willingness to stay especially after a long day walking around SFO.Therefore, I don't recommend any travelers who are not here for business to stay here.	
Jun 28 2009 	Great location and good value	Centrally located in Union Square, the Parc 55 is walking distance from the BART station which is perfect for families having just arrived on a long flight. Easy check-in and check out, rooms were clean and surprisingly quiet, although this might be due to the fact that we requested a room on a high level having read previous TripAdvisor reviews.	
Jun 26 2009 	Great hotel great location	We satyed here as part of our honeymoon whilst travelling in the US booked last minute - and where really happy with the hotel. Two large beds in all rooms with a modern twist - a lot of business people seem to use it - great shops restaurants and bars right on your doorstep. Staff can't do enough to help you - I would give this hotel 100% concierge booked all our trips to alcatraz at discount prices. Rooms great and spacious air con also great not that you need it in san francisco!!!	
Jun 26 2009 	Beautifully updated hotel - perfect location	Husband and I stayed at this Union Square gem for a combination business &amp; pleasure trip. I had a three-block walk to the Moscone Center for my conference - perfect. Cable cars, BART, and MUNI bus are one-block away - perfect. Chinatown is less than a mile away with few of the hills SF is famous for - perfect. Shopping, shopping, shopping surrounds you - perfect. Great restaurants (try New Dehli across the street FOR SURE) abound - perfect. We actually walked to Fisherman's Wharf, but for less adventurous, it is a quick cable car ride.The hotel has been renovated beautifully. The public spaces are gorgeous. Rooms are pretty spacious and the bed was absolutely comfy. With all the great food around, we did not enjoy Cityspace (the restaurant/bar), but it looked very chic and like a great place to have a drink. The fitness center leaves a bit to be desired, but with all the walking around we did, not an issue. No pool... The concierge desk was terrific. They always had great suggestions and good directions. We arrived early and the room wasn't ready. The bell desk downstairs checked our luggage for free and we enjoyed the day in the city before returning to our room. Rates were good in comparison to other hotels in area. STAY HERE!!!	
Jun 25 2009 	Good location but walls are thin	the location is great as others have said, but the walls are so thin. we could hear every word our neighbors were saying and they weren't even being loud. sounded like they were just having a normal conversation. hallway noise is particularly loud too. we had to ask to move to another room because we couldn't sleep. that room was much better, but we could still hear the hallway noise.	
Jun 24 2009 	Great stay perfect location	This hotel has the most perfect location - just across the street from the Powell BART station which brings you from the airport to downtown and at the cable cars and buses. Some people have complained about the hotel being too close to a &quot;bad&quot; neighbourhood (Tenderloin). We've spoken to some locals and though they don't encourage us to wander through the area at night it really isn't that bad. Just to give you the complete picture: the hotel is located directly opposite Nordstrom, Bloomingdales and lots of really fancy shops. The exterior of the hotel looks a bit outdated, but inside it's really nice. They have recently renovated the rooms and reception area (which probably also explains the noise other reviewers were complaining about) and everything looks fresh, modern and tidy. We stayed in room 1311 and the airconditioning did need some TLC to get started. The bathroom and room itself were great. Super comfy bed, huge tv and a clean and large bathroom. There are complimentary ear plugs which I had to use (light sleeper) but they did the trick. The only thing that disappointed me was the 13 dollar fee for 24 hours use of internet! We tried getting an unsecured WIFI connection but ended up in Starbucks one block up the street.	
Jun 20 2009 	Excellent stay!	My family stayed in San Francisco for a few days before spending several days traveling down the Pacific Coast Highway down to L.A. While in SF, we had a very enjoyable stay at the Parc 55 and would definitely stay there again! First of all, we took BART from the airport to Union Square and were pleasantly surprised that the hotel was right across the street from the BART station. It was great not having to drag all of our luggage several blocks or having to pay for a taxi or bus. As we approached a hotel, a doorman immediately asked us if we needed help bringing in our luggage, and the rest of the staff was friendly and courteous. Both the lobby and our room were modern and well-appointed.We paid a very reasonable AAA rate for a two club rooms (located on floors 28-32) and were not disappointed. The views were beautiful, and the beds were extremely comfortable. Club rooms also included evening hors'devours and breakfast at the club lounge on the 31st floor. The food was delicious! The hotel's location was always a plus, as well. Besides being next to the BART station, it is a block from the cable cars and convenient to great shopping. The backside of the hotel is near the seedy Tenderloin area, but we never walked towards that direction, and never felt unsafe at all. I also understand that the valet parking is expensive, but we waited to rent our car until the day we left San Francisco so that was not a problem for us. Overall, we would be more than happy to come back to the Parc Fifty Five if we return to San Francisco!	
Jun 15 2009 	This place sucks! NOISY! A/C does not work! Don't GO THERE!	I was referred to this hotel by a friend and therefore had pretty high hopes. Positive: This hotel is within walking distance of the mall Lobby is beautiful and contemporary, the restaurant is as well. The hotel room looks nice online, however once entering the room it looked like it once was an older hotel with newer furniture. Location: This hotel is on the outer edge of union square across from the Westfield Mall and backed up against a shady neighborhood. Even when checking in the reservation employee circled our current location &amp; then drew an arrow directly behind the hotel stating that it is an area of high crime. We did not wander that way during our stay but on the day of check out we did drive that way and all we saw were crack addict looking people. So she was right!Room: New Furniture, no mini bar, drinks at the vending machine outside is $2.50 so you are better off going to Walgreens before going back to your hotel. AC does not work we had to turn it to 62 degrees to get cold air and even then it took several hours to finally get cool. You are even better off a the Marriott.Internet; There were several cheaper places that offers free wifi around the area, I was disturbed to find out that this hotel charged $13/day.Parking: $44/day! Room Service: Food arrived coldWe stayed very high up on the 19th floor however it was extremely noisy. We had a king suite next to apparently noisy people who stayed up until 4am talking loudly and drunkenly probably. Banging of the doors etc...I can deal with outside noise which is expected of a busy city like this and New York. However the class of the people staying in this hotel is ridiculous. There must have been 10 girls in 1 room partying. Its not the RED ROOF INN! My boyfriend and I are a young couple, we drink go out and have fun but even the noise was just ridiculous. When reporting the complaint to the desk they did not resolve the matter after continuing to hear the noise and disruption for another 20 mins, I called again, finally speaking to a security personnel who resolved the matter. I've learned my lesson and will gladly pay an extra $100 for class. This place is horrible!	
Jun 11 2009 	$100/day incidental fee they don't tell you about!	Typically hotels hold a credit card in case charges are made. Parc 55 charges you $100 / day on your card IN ADVANCE before you even make any charges. I am staying 10 days and was supposed to be charged $1000, but for some reason they decided to only charge me $100. I have yet to see if I'll be getting this money back. Worse, nowhere on the website can I find information regarding this incidental charge. Several people at the front desk I spoke to said they had no idea if the information was on the website or not. I've traveled numerous times for both business and pleasure and this is the first time I've had this happen to me or heard of it happening. Stay tuned folks...	
Jun 8 2009 	Outstanding- much better than expected	We stayed here 3 nights before heading down to LA and received an upgrade to a suite from a superior room(without asking, still not sure why but obviously didnt complain!) . It was amazing, much bigger than our own flat in London! We were on the top floor with amazing views across San Fran. The hotel itself was lovely, modern, and clean, with polite desk staff. We didnt eat in the restaurant so can't comment on that, but the cafe beside the entrance had great value for breakfast/lunch. The area was perfect for us as we were there to do sightseeing and the odd bit of shopping - it was across the road from a big shopping centre and right beside the tourist info centre, the BART stop (which goes to and from the airport so is really handy) and its really near the start of the cable cars/trams that take you down to fishermans wharf. We got the three day passport for the carts which was good value. The reason I gave a 4/5 for service was only because they didnt replace the coffee and milk in the room on 2 occasions, but otherwise it was good, with 2 services/day to the room. The bed was really comfortable and the decor was modern.I would really recommend this hotel for anyone visiting san fran for the first time and who is interested in shopping and sightseeing.	
Jun 8 2009 	Horrible customer service	The rooms were good, location was convientent and view was amazing but the customer service was dreadfull!! We had plenty of money to spend but walked in wearing jeans and t-shirts, a lady at check in, named Cristina, was extremly snoody not one that should work with the public. I will never stay there again due to her attitude!	
Jun 7 2009 	Sure It's Loud....But Great Location 	It's no secret that the Parc 55 Hotel is in the path of lots of street noise, especially if you are facing Market Street. The sirens are the biggest culprit at all hours of the night, but it's something you get used to pretty quickly. The hotel is really nice and the rooms are comfortable. The views are amazing. We are certainly in the category of budget travelers who were pleasantly surprised that this hotel showed up on a Priceline bid.We were double upgraded at check in. Our Priceline rate assured us a Deluxe Room (up to the 19th floor with a king bed). We asked for a high room and got a 20th floor View Room (20th-26th floors) with two double beds. The double beds are considered an upgrade at this hotel....at least price wise. We were very satisfied. No problems at check in, but we did not get in until 8:30 p.m......no line at all.We liked the 37&quot; flat screen TV and the 5 soft pillows on each bed. The noise kept us up the first night, but we did better with our sleep from there. No problems with housekeeping. The room was very clean. Thanks to the great information on Trip Advisor, we knew not to rent a car. We were glad to avoid the very high nightly parking rates and the hotel is right on The Powell Station for BART and the cable car turnaround. It was easy to get around town. We bought a City Pass at the Visitor's Center at the Powell Station and it was a reasonable value.We did not use the Internet service or the restaurant. There was a nice mall acroos the street with cheaper dining options. The business center would have cost us $20.00 to print out our boarding passes, but the Concierge did it without charge.....and we tipped for the courtesy. The bellman was very accommodating and held our bags after checkout so we could sight see with free hands up until 2:30 p.m. when we needed to head for the airport.We were pleased with the hotel. It met everyone of our very basic needs and was in a really nice location for wide eyed tourists like us. We would certainly stay here again.	
Jun 3 2009 	Loved the hotel great location would definitely stay again.	I booked the hotel on travelocity.com for half price. I stayed with 6 friends in connecting rooms. One was a king room one was a 2 double bed room. I called a couple of weeks before our stay to request connecting rooms, non smoking rooms and I also requested a room on an upper floor(because of the street noise). All of my requests were met. One room was ready when we arived so we checked into that room early. The other room was ready just a couple hours later. We had a great time in San Francisco.	
Jun 3 2009 	Location is perfect	You can't ask for a better location when staying in SF. Throw in wonderful views (assuming a high enough floor), friendly service (although check-in was a touch long, the bartender was great), it was a great hotel. 4-stars, through and through and I can't ocmplain about the price. Very pleased with the overall experience.	
Jun 1 2009 	Great location great stay	If you are planning on going to Union Square for shopping, etc., then this is wonderful. We couldn't have asked for a better location. The room was clean and well-appointed, and when we had a problem with the shower head, it was fixed immediately and courteously. If you want to complain about parking rates, you haven't traveled to big cities often enough to know to check on that before you rent a car and go downtown. Locating reasonable parking garages was easy in that area because we knew to do that. Parc 55 was easy to get to, and it was close enough to Powell to be handy, but far enough away to keep the noise level down. The bar served a great drink. We were very pleasantly surprised.	
Jun 1 2009 	Noisy and unexpected costs	Not a good hotel and not a bad hotel. It goes to what is important when you are on a business trip. Parking is $55.00 per night. Drive one block up from the hotel and there is the parking garage that the hotel uses. Self park there for $20 per night. Internet is $17 per day. Three doors down at Starbucks it's free. Noisy. Requested a room on one of the upper floors. Got the 18th floor and we could hear music and revelers from the bar across the street and streetsweepers woke us up at 4am. The inconvenience for business travelors doesn't make this place competitive with the customer service oriented, comparably priced boutique hotels that surround it.	
May 31 2009 	Ehh....	Other than being nickled and dimed for every little thing, the room was clean, the location great, the base rate reasonable, and the service friendly. I would recommend the hotel to friends/colleagues with the warning of the outrageous parking fee, and other service fees which are higher than most places I've stayed. Noise was an issue - both outside traffic (didn't really mind) and in-hotel (thin walls?). For the price, I also expected nicer rooms.	
May 30 2009 	Great location and rooms at the Parc 55	My son (college student) and I did a quick trip to San Francisco this week. We arrived at 10:30 a.m. after a very short walk from the BART station ($5.35 one way from SFO) and were very happy that they had a room available for us despite checking in hours before the official check in time. Our room didn't have much of a view (was on the 13th floor) but we didn't expect a view room with the price we got on the hotel's web site (109/night). The beds were very comfortable and the room was very stylish. We had a flat screen tv which had a nice variety of channels, including HBO. The bathroom was large and even had a phone in it. The only complaint I really would have with the bathroom would be that there is no vent fan and the bathroom is a bit dark. But everything else was good with a generous amount of towels and even a magnifying mirror.The location, as I said before, is really good if you don't plan on bringing a car, since it is very close to the BART Station, a cable car turnaround, and a very nice mall. There are several Walgreens not too far away if you forgot something and on the other end of the spectrum, at the Mall there is a Nordstroms.There is a charge for the internet but we didn't use our computer there at the hotel. They have a fitness center and a business center, again neither one was used by us. I would stay at the Parc 55 again if I go back to San Francisco.	
May 27 2009 	Best location if you're without a car	The best thing about Parc 55 is location location location. If you are coming to SF without a car, this is probably one of the best places to stay. It is next to the Powell Street Station so you can catch the MUNI or the BART without a problem. I was on this trip without a car, but parking each day is probably around $45, which seems outrageously expensive, but in all honestly, this is average for a SF hotel, especially in the Union Square area. There are parking lots within walking distance that are cheaper, but since I did not use any, I cannot recommend a specific one. If you're taking the BART in from SFO, it will cost you less than $6 to get to the hotel.Since it is close to this hub of public transportation (including the famous cable cars), and surrounded by the major shopping area of the city, you should be aware that there is a lot of city street noise through the night. If you are a light sleeper, you will need the highest floor possible to get away from the hustle &amp; bustle. If you are used to it, or can sleep through anything, you probably wouldn't even notice the noises. However, the hotel does provide ear plugs if you need them.Some people seem confused by the lobby being on the second floor, which is understandable, but don't forget this is SF and buildings are built into the hills. There are signs all over the place to direct you to the correct place to check in and elevators to get you to the second floor. There's also a great staff to assist you if you come in on the ground level, which is still under renovations. Or if you're feeling spry, you can always walk up the hill to another entrance and take a short flight of steps to the second level directly. Also, if you are on a lower level, do not expect a great view of the bay from your room like they feature on their website. You are, after all, surrounded by other tall buildings, block after block. If you really like the views, I would ask the front desk for the highest level possible upon checking in. The room we had was one of the recently renovated from floor to ceiling so everything looks great. For me, the bed was too firm, but I am used to sleeping on foam so all traditional beds are less than comfortable to me. The room featured flat screen tv's &amp; a safe, but no fridges, unless you're willing to pay for it, and also no free Wi-fi. There is a business center and a 24 hour fitness center, both of which I did not frequent.The hotel features the cityhouse restaurant &amp; bar, located on the 2nd floor lobby, which I recommend, especially if you have a late arrival like I did and do not feel like finding a place to get a quick bite (fast food restaurants aside).	
May 27 2009 	Nice remodel	We stayed at the Parc 55 May 13-15 at the end of a trip to the Wine Country. Got the hotel for $86/night on Priceline and we were very happy with the accommodations for the price. The hotel went through a remodel that was finished about 6 weeks ago and it's very sleek and modern looking right now. Definitely a nice surprise, especially for the price we paid. Location is great; walking distance to several restaurants, Union Square and the cable car/BART stop. The only negative was that the bathroom was a little small. Other than that, great hotel, we'd definitely stay again!	
May 24 2009 	Great Hotel...Couldn't ask for more!	My husband and I visited San Francisco for the first time and stayed at the Parc 55 Hotel for five days. The hotel rooms are very clean and the service was great. I had called ahead and requested a room on a higher floor and my request was granted with no problems. Our room was a bay view with exceptional views! Everything was just steps outside of the hotel...BART....cable cars...downtown. We were very pleased with the location and will definitely stay at this hotel again.	
May 24 2009 	Terrific location!	Stayed there in early April 2009. PositivesLocated right in the middle of the shopping area of San Farncisco at 55 Cyril Magnin St, about 100 metres to the new Westfield shopping centre . Room was comfortable and clean. Staff were very helpful and couldn't do enough for us. Terrific location. Very reasonable tariff if booking online.NegativesEntrance was difficult to locate as it was off street at level 2. No swimming pool.	
May 23 2009 	Always a Pleasure to Stay at Parc 55	I can't say the negative reviewers are wrong, but I've stayed at this hotel 6 or 7 times, maybe more. My traveling attire is always casual, running pants and baggy shirt, light jacket, gators. So, I know they don't give you a bad room because of your dress. With each visit if a room on a high floor with a view was available, I was given such a room. Service has always been professional and friendly. Rooms are lovely and beds are comfortable. Rooms are business friendly too. Good lights, good chair. Sorry for the trouble the other reviewers had, but I've always had a good experience with this hotel -- and I've always booked through hotwire.	
May 22 2009 	*Horrible* experience	The hotel itself is nice. Convenient location, nice rooms, comfortable and clean. However, the stay was a nightmare. I arrived at about 9 PM to check in, and they told me that they didn't have my room ready and that it would be 30 minutes or so. They gave me a $10 coupon for the bar. Okay, not too terrible... 10 PM rolls around and they still don't have a room. Come 11:30 PM, I'm getting pretty annoyed. They wouldn't put me up at another hotel (and I had pre-paid through Expedia) or accommodate me in any way. I didn't get a room until 1:30 AM. They didn't offer any kind of compensation. They wouldn't even refund the cost of the room for that night! Outrageous!	
May 20 2009 	Buyer (Credit card) Beware!!	I and my three friends had the pleasure of visiting San Francisco in May this year (wonderful city). We chose to stay in Parc 55 and the hotel did meet our expectations. The rooms and location were ideal for our trip.HOWEVER!!! I came home to find an extra charge on my credit card for a 3rd room apparently attached to my booking. This is despite the fact that I (as directed) printed my booking and produced it upon check-in. I have a copy of my reservation confirmation stating that 2 rooms were booked and listing all four guests. There is no mention of a 3rd room.When I realised there was an extra charge and a charming lady informed me that the hotel would not have chosen my name or credit card out of the millions of people in the world to charge and couldn't have been less helpful. She did eventually suggest that she could pass the &quot;case&quot; to a manager.I await his call...	
May 20 2009 	Great Location but be aware of . . .	I would not rate this hotel as a 4 star, but it is a 3+. The rooms have been upgraded with new furniture and linens, but they left the old carpet (really, just change it), and the rather old wallpaper. However, they are clean and neat. At first, they gladly informed me that there were only two rooms available, a suite that they would gladly give me for my quoted price, and a room on a lower floor, that was just the deluxe I reserved. Well of course I opted for the suite, BUT when I got there, it was a bit nasty - stained carpet, horrible view - not so great bathroom, so I went back downstairs and asked if I could see the Deluxe I reserved. They said sure, and when I went to that room, it was much cleaner, nice view, just better overall - I kept that room and told them no thanks to the upgraded suite. During check in, after they took my id and credit card, they informed me that they just charged my credit card and extra $100. per day - surprise! Apparently it is their policy to charge this for any incidentials that you might rack up during your stay. For me it was an extra $500 seeing I was staying for 5 nights. I protested a bit letting the clerk know that she really should not charge one's credit card without their knowledge. It is unacceptable to inform me AFTER the fact. With that she said she would reverse that charge, and just have me pre-pay for the room. I still don't know what that was all about. But I did not feel too comfortable with all the charging and reversing she did on my credit card, so when I got settled in my room, I called my credit card company to see what just went on. Well I am glad I did because she charged me twice for the room and twice for the incidentials and only reversed one of the incidentials charges. I call the front desk and explained what I just learned and at first they were a bit pompus and said they will explain how a credit card works. When I told them I was clearly aware how a credit card works and didn't need their lesson, they did indeed correct the charges (as I verified the next day with my credit card company).There are plenty of amenities at this hotel, but NOTHING is free. The bottled water left in your room - $4.50 each, a fridge $25., internet access $12.50/day, etc. Just know whatever great price you landed on the internet for this hotel, is for the room, and the room only.The location couldn't be better. Every type of transportation available in SF is available to you right across the street, and you never have to wait more than 5-10 minutes for any of them. We bought the City-Pass, and it was the best thing we did. We could get on and off of any type of transportation, (trolley, cable car, bus anything except taxi's) without paying extra, and it included coupons for many attractions. This also can be purchased right across the street at the Visitors Center.Take Lorries Shuttle from the airport to the hotel for about $16 pp, and they will give you a coupon for your return trip for $12 ppThe bellman services were exceptional.The restaurant is over-priced. There are too many great, reasonable restaurants around.I say yes, go there, but understand that nothing is free!	
May 17 2009 	Horrible experience.	I am writing to complain about my experience at this hotel on May 16th 2009. I arrived to check in to the hotel at approximately 4pm and waited in line to check in for 20 minutes. When I got to the check in counter, the staff member explained to me that there was not a room available despite my fully prepaid reservation. She explained I would have to relocate myself to the Marriott Hotel. When I asked to speak to a supervisor, the supervisor went on to explain that because I had booked through hotels.com, we would be asked to leave the Parc 55 due to overbooking.I had these reservations well in advance. This night was meant to be special for my wife and I who were celebrating our 7 year anniversary. Needless to say, this huge unexpected inconvienance ruined our night. This took a full 3 hours out of our evening.I do not understand the hotel's policy of allowing a room to be booked and paid for, only to give the room to someone else. If you do not honor your 3rd party bookings, why allow it at all?I felt completely disrespected, embarrassed and humiliated by this experience. I also feel that I was discriminated against based on my age and my dress. I was dressed to attend the SF Giants baseball game that just finished. Regardless of my age or because I had jeans and a Giants T-shirt on, I have plenty of money to spend at hotels like these, but I will not return to the Parc 55. I am thankful that the Marriott took us in, but I did not receive what a paid for, which was a renovated deluxe King room at the Parc 55 hotel. The room at the Marriott was not to standard, dirty, outdated, and the view I had was of the hotel interior.Hotels.com has issued me a full refund. The Parc 55 should be ashamed of itself.	
May 17 2009 	Outstanding experience at Parc 55- brilliant location and professional staff	I had the most wonderful stay at The Parc 55. recommended by my sister as amazing value for money and excellent location in the heart of all the shops and things to do. Catch the trolley to the Quay or just shop until you drop. It is all there. Ericka at Reception checked me in and Hanif is an encyclopedia about where to go and how to get there. he is calm and so professional.Thanks to Ericka and Hanif for an amazing stay. see you soon! Manny , Vancouver, Canada	
May 16 2009 	Excellent value location and comfort	My husband and I planned a last minute trip to San Francisco for our wedding anniversary. We stayed at Parc 55 for four nights. We found an excellent price online ($89.00 per night) . This hotel exceded our expectations. When we checked in a little early, our room hadn't been cleaned yet so we were upgraded to a room with a fabulous view of the city and the bay. The room was very nice, very comfortable bed and lux linens. The location is great, right by shopping and public transportation. Like many downtown San Francisco hotels, parking here is quite expensive. We found a garage a few blocks away that charged $25 a night and walked to the hotel. The only (small) downsides to this hotel...VERY hot water in the shower and bathroom sink, we nearly burnt ourselves; the shower curtain seemed very ineffective, water kept spilling out onto the bathroom floor no matter how careful we were; and no fridge in the rooms.	
May 13 2009 	Solid 4 star hotel in perfect location	I wasnt really sure where to stay in San Francisco and found the Parc 55 @ a very good price and expected not much. As I do like to use public transport wherever it is offered I took the bart train from the airport to powell station, which is next to the hotel. This is already a plus for the hotel. Check in was hassle free and I took the advantage to use their Club Lounge as well. Room was on a high floor with nice view over the city and comes with to small double beds, flat screen TV and a bathroom with bathtub. Layout and style was pretty nice- I would rate it 4 Star. In room Internet access for 24h is 12.95USD. The Club Lounge is typical American fair- you need to use your Key Card to enter- so no real concierge service. The view is nice and the complimentary continental breakfast contains bagels,toast, cold cuts, fresh fruits and pastries of a good quality. During the evening they do offer small snacks like cheese and crackers and some sweets. Soft drinks are free of charge but for the booze you will have to pay. If you are not fancy about a Club Lounge- there is even a grab and go breakfast buffet in the lobby. This is indeed not a world- class hotel but overall I was quiet surprised with the service received.	
May 13 2009 	Very positive experience for 2 picky travelers	My wife and I stayed here for two nights, after booking for a very reasonable price on Priceline. Given the low rates, we were prepared for (and honestly would have been fine with) anything.We are both somewhat light sleepers and our biggest concern at any hotel is noise. Obviously, staying so close to Union Square and the cable car turntable, we expected to hear some street noise. Thus, we asked for a room on the highest available floor (without paying for an upgrade). The check-in representative was very willing to accommodate us, and she even went out of her way to make sure we weren't stuck in a room adjacent to the elevators.Ultimately, we had a room on the 23rd floor, and noise--from the street, from other rooms, etc.--was never a problem. We were quite pleased.The room, in all other respects, was fantastic, too. The bed and pillows were very comfortable, and the room and bathroom were very spacious. We had a great view, and the location was unbeatable (steps from the BART, cable cars, and other public transit).We did not explore much of the hotel outside our room. We didn't pay for wireless internet access (a fairly high rate). Likewise, we didn't have a car, so the steep parking rates didn't affect us. Given the rates and the hotel's great location, I would strongly discourage bringing a car.Overall, we were very pleased with our two nights at Parc 55, and we will be happy to stay there again on our next visit to San Francisco.	
May 12 2009 	Great location good value	We stayed 4 nights from 7 May on a room on the 27th floor, which gave us access to the Club Lounge on the 31st floor for Continental breakfast. Because the rooms are currently being discounted, this was good value for money. We didn't get a spectacular view of the city unfortunately, because our room was facing the wrong side. But apart from that the breakfast, room decor, and service were all what I would expect from a city center hotel of this calibre. There was a lot of noise from the street, but the complimentary ear plugs blocked it out (I am a light sleeper). I agree with the other reviewer about the enthusiastic housekeeping staff. Not only do they want to start early, they also knock later to check the room was serviced. So make sure you put that &quot;Do Not Disturb&quot; sign out if you want some privacy. The location, just a few steps from the Powell St cable car which takes you to Fisherman's Wharf was great. You can also take the retro F-line trams from Market Street (again, just a short walk from the hotel). There are also plenty of dining options in every direction. On a more general note, I've never seen so many beggars before visiting San Francisco. But none was aggressive. Personally, I prefer to tip the buskers who are at least doing something in return for money.	
May 12 2009 	Would return again	I had a wonderful time being in the middle of union square...the room was nice the bed was excellent. The view was not what i wanted, but they were going under construction so i couldnt get it....our check in time was suppose to be at 3pm, but they let us check in early.	
May 9 2009 	EXCELLENT HOTEL FOR THE PRICE AND LOCATION	Stayed here for 6 days, me , my spouse and my 2 yrs old daugter. We booked our rooms through Priceline, paid 89$ per night. We checked in our room close to 3pm. Sarah checked us in. There was no wait time when we arrived, pretty much the lobby was empty. Their looby is on the 2nd floor. Entrance is a bit awkard, you actually have to go to 2nd floor to get checked in. As per our request we were upgraded to 20th floor (don't know for sure that she did upgraded us or we were actually going to get the room on 20th floor initally, but she did give a bit bigger room then the traditional king size room. It was the conner room, had 3 big windows with spectacular view of the city. Amenities included flat screen tv, coffe maker, sham/conditioner, lotion, ear plugs, shower cap, shoe polish, cable connection wire, (this is all I can rememder at this time). Internet was almost 13 $/day. Fridge is free if you have medicine to keep in it else it is $25/day. We didn't rent car so never inquired about parking. Concierge was very helpful everytime we went there. Great location - close to B.A.R.T, muni subway, trolley car station, multpile bus stations close, visitor information center (9am - 5pm), shopping center and restuarants. Street noise : honestly by the end of the day we were so tired that we slept pretty much through out the night - didnot have to use ear plugs at all.Tenderlion area: Is only few blocks away from the hotel.even after reading the reviews --- did we go...? Yes we did., but during the day time. We knew where we had to go so we did not stop, kept on walking till we reached our destination. Few said somethings we never paid attention or made eye contact. We made sure that before sunset we were back to the hotel.HouseKepping - no problems there, either. Didnot eat at the hotel or used gym - so can't comment on that.I will not give it a 4star because the interior decoration did not measure up to the standard. Also I didnot find mattress to be as comfortable as most people said.Overall good place for the price we paid.	
May 6 2009 	Highly recommended for its superb location and value	Had booked two rooms for my family and sisters after attending our daughter's wedding in Los Angeles. The extended trip was equally momentuous where we had great time shopping, sightseeing and including drinking in the comfort of our rooms. Was glad to have booked the Park 55 club . Must say that the staff, Robert, and Sergio in the platinium lounge (30th floor) were superb in their service making us feel very &quot;at home&quot;. The hotel was very conveniently located to the shopping areas and near to the tram station and bus stops along market street. One recommendation is for better signage and location to the business center which was rather deserted on the 4th floor making it quite frightening for your guest to be alone using the internet , if at all. Also, Your chambermaid enthusiasm to do their job woke us up at 8.30am when they knocked at our doors to check if we want our rooms to be made. Overall , Park 55 is a highly recommended hotel for anyone going to San Francisco notwithstanding an uncalled unpleasant and snide remarks by your bellboy ,Oscar over his tips when handling our luggage.!Room 2853_57	
May 1 2009 	very happy	We were very happy with this hotel. we found the staff and concierge in particular to be extremely helpful. for the price we paid we couldn't believe what we got. Theres a cheap coffee shop just down stairs so no need to use the hotel breakfasts...	
Apr 28 2009 	Great value friendly staff fabulous views and location	I didn't know where to stay and got more confused the more I looked, really. Decided not to stay at Hotel Drisco as it is a bit far away from the attractions and public transport, but did take a chance on Parc55, spending a bit more money on a Club Floor room (so we could use the lounge and take advantage of the continental breakfast, evening hors d'oeurves and desserts - all very nice, too). This hotel is in a great location, only minutes from Union Square and the cable car and some great shopping. There were a few panhandlers, but actually they are everywhere you go, including posh Union Square and eclectic Fisherman's Wharf, and they are not at all threatening (some are even funny).The room was fabulous (we got the upgrade of a lifetime)with great views from huge picture windows and the hotel staff were friendly and very welcoming. It was a lovely place to go back to at the end of the day. One downside was the noise of the city (which reached even the 32nd floor, but was less noticeable once the jet lag wore off!).I thought about spending a lot of money on a hotel room in Nob Hill, but really, value for money (and I include friendly service in the value) is very important these days and the Parc 55 provided all of that.	
Apr 22 2009 	Only positive feature is the location.	This hotel is located a few blocks from Union Square. That's it-- that's its only selling point. Otherwise it is oddly configured, cheap, and NOT a four star hotel. Also, the elevators were not functioning well and a constant source of irritation. As we attempted to check in, we entered through the streel level and had to wait for an elevator to reach the second floor for the registration desk (which is odd). We had to wait behind 30 people who were also using the hotel for its event space -- the whole process was dispiriting and annoying. In short everything about this hotel feels wrong, mostly because it is aspiring to be a 4-star but only putting in half the budget. It just doesn't work.	
Apr 22 2009 	Move to a better neighborhood	Parc 55 is a wanabee 4 star hotel but needs to move to a better neighborhood. It's close to shopping and the cable cars, but also to the Tenderloin district and a grubby and noisy street scene. Earplugs are provided in room to dampen the noise from parting in the street, traffic, sirens and people who talk while walking down the hall. Lots of plywood on the street level (maybe for improvements) but not impressive as an entry or making guests feel comfortable they are entering a quality hotel.	
Apr 21 2009 	totally unexpected	Paid 89.00 got upgraded to king view. We were so happy. This is a very nice hotel.Shopping all around, Bart across the street. Bed very comfortable.What else can I say???	
Apr 21 2009 	Go for the executive rooms	Booked an executive room directly on hotel website. Rebooked 3 times beacause the price got lower. Ended up with a 124$ + tax for an executive (double)room on 29th floor including lounge acces with free breakfast and afternoon hors d'euvres.Location: Perfect for tourist purpose, absolutelyCheck-in: No problem when we arrived around 4 pmRoom: room 2920 which was a very large corner room with fantastic wiew from 3 windows. Walk-in closet, large flatscreen and even a a fitnessmachine. Coffe and tea maker as well. Icebucket so you could get icecubes at the icemachines. No fridge ;o(. Wireless internet was 12.99 for 24 hours, but we had a 50% discount.Cleaning: No problemConclusion: A very big hotel, but we did not feel it that way. The upper floors have not so many rooms. The price was very attractive, don't know if we just were lucky.Tip: Go to biscuits and blues a short walk from the hotel, ok food and good blues/jazzLounge: Nice breakfast and ok hors d'euvres. Softdrinks was free.	
Apr 20 2009 	Don't stay in Parc 55 - THIEVES ARE ON THE PROWL	We spent 10 nights on the executive floor of this 4 star hotel and can't say I would recommend it to friends.Firstly, the executive lounge located on the 32nd floor is tiny and bleak. It can be a real scrum to get breakfast first thing in the morning, and about 50% of the time, it wasn't even possible to get a seat in the lounge. The staff in the lounge aren't particularly helpful either. There's nothing executive about the experience.The staff aren't particularly helpful either. The number of times we called the front desk to speak to a manager and were told they were either in a meeting or unavailable was extraordinary. They always promised a call back, and without exception (on 3 occassions) that call never came.WARNING: use the in-room safe. The hotel publicity states that safety deposit boxes are available at reception, but they are actually in the room. We had over $200 stolen from our room and whilst the wannabe cop who is the director of security was initially helpful, we never had contact from him again. Customer service in the hotel is a real let down, which is a shame, because the hotel is in a fantastic location and comes at a great price.All in all, my advice is don't spend the extra money on the executive floor. It really isn't worth it.Shop around other hotels in SFO, and if you are planning for staying for more than a few days, telephone them to try and negotiate a better rate. I wouldn't stay here again.	
Apr 20 2009 	Great location nice rooms	this is one of the cheaper 4* places in such a prime location. Rooms great, but the reception is on floor 2, which is a little strange. No free wifi. TV OK. I requested view, got 18th floor, giving great view over city.	
Apr 17 2009 	Did not get promised room	This was my first trip using hotels dot com website, i booked a non smoking king deluxe special offer for the parc 55, i was driving and was running a little late and so i called up the hotel in late afternoon saying i might check in late night, they said it should be fine, i arrive around midnight that night, the hotel lobby has only one elevator working and there was a line of around 30 guests waiting to go upto the second floor for reception/checkin, well that was fine, once i start to check in i am informed that only rooms availabe for me are a smoking queen or a non smoking two double beds, i was very dissapointed and i called hotels dot com number and they said that even though i paid for a king deluxe, they are third party and Cannot guarantee any room Ever and that i should have read the fine print terms and conditions, so i was not eligible for any refund or change of hotel, the room that is available is the only one i can get. I was exhausted and sleepy and so there was no point arguing here, accepted a smoking queen bed on a lower floor, requested the hotel ppl to see if i could get a nonsmoking king deluxe room the next day if possible. Was very dissapointed but was powerless here. Next day called hotels dot com again and they were sorry for the inconvinience and gave me a fifty dollar voucher for future use with them. The hotel gave me a great room on the 20th floor with superb bay views, king non smoking at around 2pm the next day, so was happy for the next two nights. Asides from this experience, the hotel has a superb location right next to the cable car and the powell station / union square with easy access to all public transport, i had a car and did not use the hotel valet parking which is 44dollars a night and used a nearby garage at 20 dollars a night with in and out privileges, the housekeeping was very efficient, bathrooms and rooms were very clean, bed was very comfortable, did not have a microwave or fridge in the room. It is more like a business hotel, but good for tourists too. They charge for everything including bottled water, health club and internet access and even local calls! So beware while using any of those services.So my conclusion is when you book with hotels dot com dont have any expectations of the room you have booked, they will Try to give you the room you have booked, but it is not guaranteed.Reach early, right around check in time so that you can increase your chances of getting the desired room.	
Apr 13 2009 	Great Convenient Location 	The Parc 55 was a great place to stay - especially since it was our first trip to SF. The location is extremely convenient - it is around the corner (less than a block) from the Powell St BART station and the beginning of the cable car route (also Powell St)! Taking the BART to and from SFO was SO EASY and definitely recommended at $5.35/person each way (much less than taking a shuttle or taxi). Union Square is only a few blocks away and Market Street is a half block (not even) to the south. The hotel staff was very polite and accomodating. They were very helpful in booking a rental car for us for the one day we left the city. We had a GREAT room on the 31st floor (2nd from the top) - with an amazing view of the city and the bay! The room was clean, plenty big enough and the (king) bed was very comfy! The only complaint is the lack of drawer space, but we made it work! The bathroom was also a good size and very clean! Also since we were so high up, we heard barely any street noise, with the exception of the occasional sirens. They also provide travel books/magazines in the rooms with GREAT suggestions for places to eat -- we found some of our best restaurants in them!The lobby is still under construction, however aside from having to head to the 2nd floor to check-in (which is very easy to do), you wouldn't know it! I never heard any noise or encountered any issues! The 2nd floor lobby area is very nice and looks as though it is supposed to be there! The restaurant was nice, but we didn't eat there - just stopped in for a drink one night before heading up to our room. Drinks were about average price for the area. There is a great bar/pub a block up from the hotel - Foley's Irish House - we frequented this place the 2nd half of the week - great beer and they ususally had live music!Overall, this was a great, convenient place to stay and we would recommend it to anyone!Insider tips: 1) Buy the Muni Passport (I believe they come in 1, 3, 5 or 7 Day passes) - it pays for itself very quickly (Cable Car ride = $5 each way)!! We used the cable cars, trolleys and buses every day - which is a very convenient way to get around!2) Although the lines get pretty long at the cable car turn-arounds -- they usually move pretty quickly - or you can head up a block or two and jump on!	
Apr 13 2009 	Great Rate Great Location Nice Hotel	I stayed at this hotel from 4/10/09-4/12/09 over Easter weekend. I landed the hotel on Priceline for a rate of $72 plus taxes and fees. Parc 55 webrates were in the mid 80's so I saved just a few bucks. The hotel was very busy when I arrived and the hotel front desk said the property was full. There was alot of activity but I am always surprised when my Priceline bid is accepeted at a hotel that says they are full. The hotel entrance is located right near the Powell Street BART so its very convenient to take the subway from the airport to the hotel. It costs $5.35 each way for about a 30 minute ride. It is is very easy to use. I got off the part and walked across the the street onto Cyril Magnin. The hotel entrance is right on the corner and one has to take an elevator up from the Cyril Magnin Street entrance to the registration desk on the second floor. I had to wait a few minutes for an elevator since their was a line.Their was a small line as well waiting to check-in but I only had to wait a few minutes. The clerk was very gracious and greeted me kindly. She made no mention on Priceline and honored my verbal request for a room on a high floor. I knew from reading tripadvisor.com that a room on a high floor would be less noisey with a nicer view. I was assigned room 2957. I was a bit disappointed when I got off the elevator to see my room was very close to the elevator and right across from the ice and soda machine. Yet, I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the door to see a sleek, well appointed room. The room had a large king bed with nice sheets and a quality duvet. There was a flat screen tv, a small couch, a desk, three telephones, coffee maker, and a large window that had a partially blocked view of the bay and civic center area. I could see what I thought was Alcatrez. I was even more satisfied when I laid down on the bed. It was very very very comfortable.Since I am diabetic and did not see a minibar to place my insulin, I called down for a refrigerator. Housekeeping brought one to the room very quickly for no charge. I quickly umpacked my clothes for the weekend and noticed there was not to much drawere space for clothes. There were a few hangers in the closet along with two robes, but storage would be a problem for a longer stay. I checked out the bathroom which had all the stardard amenitites, a free bottle of water, a nice tub and three large, fluffy bath towels. Some of the bath amentities included ear plugs for noise and mouthwash. After checking out the room and the view I hooked up my computer via a wireless connection for $12.95 per 24 hours. The connection was strong. After checking emails, I went to the gym, which is free of charge, to work out.. The fitness center was great, It has lots of aerobic equipment, free weights, and weight machines. The room was relatively empty and I had a great work out. After the work out, I headed via BART to the Mission District for some burritos. The tacqueria's in the Mission make great, really large burrio's. I grabbing a carne asada burrito at El Farolito near the 24th and Mission BART stop for under five bucks. The burrito tasted amazing. Although there was a chill in the air I took the long walk back to the Parc 55. It took about 35-40 minutes. I walked along Mission to Gough to Market whcih is a very colorful neighborhood. Maybe there is shorter way but it was great to exercise after the filling carne asado burrito. I got up at 9 AM the next day and planned for a free City Guide walking tour of the Yerba Buena area. The tour started at 11 AM in front of St. Particks church by the Contempary Jewish Museum. I drank some fo the in-room coffee, took a long bath, and planned for a fun day exploring San Francisco. Yerba Buena Gardens is a short five minute walk from the Parc 55 so after getting dressed I headed outside. It was a bright sunny day and Union Square was packed with people. I made my way over to the St. Patricks church and there were a few people waiting for the free walking tour. The tour started at right on time and the guide was a local resident of the area. She had a real love for Yerba Buena and it showed it her presentation. She explained the history of the area and how it went from an inpoverished but nuturing community with many single occupancy hotels to a thriving area with large hotels, museums, shops, and a dynmic public garden. The tour lasted about one and one half hours and was terrific. I decided to go to another City Guide tour of the Embacadero area. It was such a nice day so I walked down to the Embarcadero. The walking tour started at 2 PM so it gave me time to grab some lunch. The pier has lots of places to eat and is very touristy. There is a fresh farmers market in front of the pier building and I would have been wiser grabbing some fresh fruit from a local merchant. Instead I went to the San Francisco Sea Food Company stall and had some fish chowder and fried oyster loaf. It costs abit over $16 and was less than enjoyable. After finishing up lunch I headed under the clock to meet the tour.There was a lot more people waiting for this tour and the area was pretty crowded with people. The guide was not as vibrant about the area but did his best to describe theis salty,sea port area of SF. This neighborhood has a colorful history and has gone through significant redevelopment. We walked in and around some of the buildings near the Embarcadero but I did not find the guide very engaging. I left the tour after about one hour and headed back to Union Square. I wanted to check out the easter flowers at Macy's which were really spectacular. Then, I headed back to the hotel to prepare for a facial appointment I made a LeBelle Day Spas which is located at 233 Grant Avenue. I had a facial at LaBelle three years prior and it was fantastic. The facialist Stella has great charisma and it was the cleanest my face has ever felt. I thought about that facial for years and could not wait to go back. I was excited for a similar experience. The spa has three levels and is not quite as male friendly as I would like. The male changing room is small but once you are ready, well, LaBelle is very pampering. After changing, I went to the waiting area where my feet were placed in a bowl on hot water. I ate some sweet honeydew melon as I waited for Stella Relaxation started to overtake me.My facial was fantastic. I am not sure how Stella does it, but my skin felt clean, fresh, and hydrated. Although, this was a bit expensive at $150+, well, it was worth every penny. It truly was two hours of bliss that ended with a clean skin and a relaxed mind. I walked back to the Parc 55 as releaxed and comfortable as I have ever felt. Later, I grabbed a quick dinner at King of Thai Noodle Shop. The duck and rice plate which was under ten bucks was fantastic. I headed back to the hotel for another quick work out and then to read before bed. It was a truly great day between the walking tours, facial, and inexpensive, delicious dinner. I slept soundly again.I woke up at 9 AM and drank some in room coffee and watched morning TV. Slowly I got up and began packing for my weekend getaway was soon heading to an end. I did have one more place I wanted to visit, so after packing most of my clothes I headed out to Chinatown to grab some dim sum at a small take out place I read about called Delicious Dim Sum. Its located at 752 Jackson Street. It was a long walk up a steep hill via Powell but I made it to Jackson. You really need to have stong legs to make it up that hill. I found Delicous Dim Sum which truly was a small little hole in the wall. I order shu mai, har gaw, and some sticky rice. It cost $5.40 which I thought was a bargain. The woman put the dim sum in a container and gave me a fork as I walked outside. I walked across the street and sat on the curb by a small alleyway. It was really interesting to sit on the street corner. watching people walk through China town as I ate this really delicious dim sum. The har gow and sticky rice were very good and the shui mai was some of the best I ever tasted. I was smiling brightly as I walked back to the Parc 55.I got back to my room and finshed packing. I looked out at the beautiful view and tried to breathe in the last parts of my nice weekend as I left my room. It took a while to finally get from the 29th floor to the ground floor with all the stops but the sun was shining as I headed across the street to grab the BART to SFO. It was a nice weekend and the Parc 55 really helped in making for a very pleasant, affordable stay.	
Apr 12 2009 	Perfect Starting Point for Vacation	The Parc 55 is immediately on the corner opposite the BART (best deal to travel from SFO) and around the corner from the cable cars running on Powell Street. Although the lobby is still under construction, the signs directing you to the 2nd floor were easy to find and the bellmen were quite helpful offering to take our 1 large bag and 1 carry-on for us, as well as directing us to the elevators.The gentleman who checked us in, I think his name was Robert, was also very nice and helpful. We initially had difficulty checking in - we booked our trip with Travelocity (got a great deal on airfare and 6 nights hotel stay) but we were told Travelocity had canceled our room. After sorting everything out by calling Travelocity we were able to check in. Robert attended to us the entire time I was on my cell dealing with the issue instead of asking us to step aside so he could help someone else. The room was very nice, up on the 26th floor facing City Hall. The only street noise we could hear was sirens passing by. You couldn't hear the traffic or construction. The room was nicely decorated, the bed was extremely comfortable, and the bathroom was very big. There wasn't a full dresser to put your clothes away, although this wasn't a big issue for us.The concierge was helpful in booking a rental car for us to use on the one day we planned to visit Muir Woods and Sonoma. We didn't eat at the hotel restaurant, but had drinks one night after dinner elsewhere. The prices were comparable to if we had stayed at the restaurant for another drink. There was a great bar up the block called Foley's that had live music most nights so we ended up there a lot. All in all I would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay there again myself. The only real negative was not all of the elevators were working, so you had to wait a few minutes at times. A few tips when planning a vacation:Use the BART to/from SFO - 5.35 each way per person beats the shuttlesGet the 1 3 or 7-Passports to use the public transportation - this includes unlimited rides on the cable cars/trolleys/busesThe guidebooks in the guestrooms have great suggestions for places to eat	
Apr 12 2009 	Great central location for BART and MUNI	I was trying to do a bargain trip for Spring Break, but did not want to get stuck in a one star hotel in the Tenderloin. So, I booked on Priceline and got an amazing rate. I'd never even heard of the hotel before and am really glad I took that gamble. Their list price is about $200-250 a night, and I paid less than that total for 2. Their website did have some specials very near to the rate I got on priceline, so poke around to find the links to the coupons and special rates. I liked it enough I might intentionally book through their own site.The desk clerk let me check in early! I was very happy about that since I had read other reviews indicating that they would be unhelpful in that regard. I also did not look like their normal clientele, but did not seem to get treated differently at all. Most of the people checking in and out were wearing suits and fine designer dresses, and I showed up with a backpacking backpack and REI fleece. This was my third trip to SF, but the first time staying in a hotel-- I used to stay at a friend's place. Some of the reviews here complain about the noise level, but, the noise level is about the same if you are staying in a residential area. San Francisco is just noisy at night. I came primarily to see Wicked again and to see the Bhutan exhibit at the Asian Art Museum. Both of those are one stop on the Muni. I also took the bus system to the Legion of Honor and once again, this hotel was a really good central starting place. It also helps that the websites for all these locations have muni directions on them from multiple places in the city.The only complaint I could make is that if I paid the full price for the hotel, the room seemed rather small. But once again, in San Francisco, there are so many people crammed into such a small area, this might be pretty standard.The Westfield Mall is right across the street, so you have plenty of restaurants. I went to the Bristol Farms grocery store at the bottom level and stocked up on fresh fruit and tea. The coffee/tea maker is in the dresser under the TV, so don't forget to look for it before you give up and order room service!	
Apr 12 2009 	3rd time back still great	Was a tad worried since not under Marriott and some reviews were questionable but the place is fine and still a good value. Here are some highlights:1) Booked a CLUB level room. The room was not huge but had nice views and more windows. Best part was access to lounge, so we had a continental breakfast and also hor deuvres/honor bar in the afternoon (except Saturdays, be noted). Only suggestion with that is to remember your room key (that is your access) and to get there fairly early since they don't restock often.2) The location is fine, and is one of the best hotels to use if taking BART into the City. It is right across the street from the Powell Street stop near the Cable Car turnaround. While it is true that if you walk the other direction from the hotel, it may get shady but it is very obvious that all the good stuff is toward Union Square.3) The on site restaurant was being renovated, we had lunch there and it was fine, although it did kind of look like a cafeteria. There are plenty of places to eat outside the hotel anyways.4) The one negative was the terrible elevator service (sometimes a stop on every floor down) and the check in (nearly an hour). Perhaps we caught a bad time, I know the place is popular with tours and airlines.The place is well recommended and the prices are good too, with many package plans available. It should work out for any type of visit to the City, business or pleasure	
Apr 6 2009 	wow just wow	WOW, so i had originaly reserved a club room with a view, a nice room and i had got a very good price. However, when we arived they told me they had to upgrade us to the &quot;PRESIDENTIAL SUITE&quot;, yes, no joke. the 700+ sq ft room with bay and city views on the 32nd floor was absolutely the most amazing room i had ever stepped foot in. Parc 55 made this night one to remember. Location is A+, staff was friendly, I couldnt have asked for a better experience.	
Apr 4 2009 	FABULOUS TIME - DON'T TAKE OTHERS REVIEWS SO SERIOUSLY	I am a very picky person staying only at the best hotels when we travel. I'm 49 and took my 17 yr old daughter. I have stayed in San Fran many times, at some little boutique hotel &amp; yes noise was always a factor. Wasn't sure booking with Parc 55 but turns out this is a wonderful hotel, no matter where you are in the city you will get noise from the street. The Gaming convention was in SF so the hotel was full. Staff are fantastic with all your needs and help (directions, restaurant suggestions, taking transit, etc). The front desk offered to confirm and pre check us in on our flight, which saved a lot of time at the airport. ALL HOTELS HAVE PROBLEMS. Yes flight staff book in here, but they are gracious &amp; wait for everyone to arrive &amp; all book in at one time rather than taking up every staff member at the counter. Remember San Fran airport is one of the largest in the US. Airline staff stay at many hotels there. This is a city of many cultures and colors. If you are bothered by this then don't go to SF.. People, regarless of who they are were friendly and helpful...WOULD DEFINATELY STAY HERE AGAIN. If you get a chance go to Cafe Du Nurod to take in a concert....GREAT TIME. I'd be more than happy to offer further feedback.	
Apr 3 2009 	Wonderful location!	My husband and I spent 4 nights at the Parc 55 hotel. We took the BART from the airport and was amazed to see the hotel as soon as we walked outside the terminal.The hotel is large. We were on the 16th floor and we were awoken every morning from the construction that is happening next door. They start at 7:00 am. I like to sleep in on vacation and this made it difficult. You can also hear the sirens from the firetrucks and ambulances throughout the night. I would recommend asking for a higher floor and you might be able to avoid some of this noise.The room was nice. We had a king size bed that was very comfortable. Nice size flat panel TV. I wish the rooms had small fridges.The location is great if you are a shopper. I was in heaven having so many shops so close to the hotel. Nordstroms and Bloomies are just across the street! It is very close to Macy's, Nieman Marcus, Saks, Tiffany's, and so many others.We also appreciated that the cable car pick up point is also across the street. We took advantage of the MUNI pass and used the cable car system often. We loved the city. We would definately consider this hotel again, especially because of the location.	
Apr 1 2009 	A Tale of Two Cities	My wife and I stayed here for 5 nights to celebrate her 50th birthday. The good: great room, very helpful concierge, courteous staff. The bad: weird entrance, location too close to tenderloin district. First, I'll discuss the good aspects of the hotel. Upon check-in, I requested a room as high as possible, to minimize the street noise and maximize the view, and the reservation desk gratiously offered me a room on the 18th floor, provided I didn't mind waiting until it was ready at 3:00, and I accepted. ( I should explain that when you book a deluxe king room through Priceline, you can get a room only up to the 18th floor. The rooms above that are more expensive &quot;view&quot; rooms.) It was only 12:30 p.m at that point, so we went to lunch at Lori's Diner down the street and enjoyed a lunch at a 50's theme diner, very fun. Lori's is a great spot for breakfast too, $11.25 for a huge breakfast with eggs, potatoes, pancakes,sausage, bacon. When we returned to check in at 3:30 p.m., the room still wasn't ready, so they upgraded us to a view room on the 22nd floor. Wow! Really nice, big room with big bay window overlooking city. The bed was oh so comfortable, the bathroom fantastic. Even a couch,and a flat screen tv with HBO. We loved the room. During the course of our stay, the concierge gave us helpful tips on visiting places, and they even printed out our boarding passes when it came time to leave. Very helpful and courteous, as was the rest of the staff. The maid kept the room sparkling clean, absolutely no complaints at all. Now, for the bad. The main entrance to the hotel seems to be where the garage is. You enter where the bell man is located, then have to go up 2 floors to reach the main lobby. Very weird, and it takes away from the impression you get upon entering the hotel. If you visit the Westin St.Francis, you'll notice what an amazing impression the entrance area can make. Now, there is a side entrance, which seems to me ought to be the main entrance, but people just stay outside those doors to smoke, and the doors don't even have real handles to pull the doors open, just strange knobs. Fine, this may be an unimportant criticism, but the location of the hotel is a legitimate beef. I know that there are tons of hotels right next door to the Parc 55, including the Hilton, the Abri, the Bijou, and many others, but because of the ridiculous number of homeless in the area, and the proximity of these hotels to the Tenderloin area, I would not choose to stay in any of these hotels for a leisure vacation. The homeless problem is terrible in this area. If you just move east a couple of blocks, the area becomes substantially less seedy. Hence, the title of my review. Don't get me wrong, the area is close to everything, restaurants, shopping, cable cars. Very convenient location. In fact, having looked around San Francisco, I am very glad I didn't book a hotel in the Financial District (too sterile and business-like) or Nob Hill (the hotels like the Fairmont or Stanford or Mark Hopkings are amazing, but I could not face the hills each morning) or the Wharf (too touristy). I like Union Square, however, I just would like to be a few blocks east of where I was. Now, would I stay here again? For business, definitely. The rooms and service are fantastic. And, the hotel seems to cater to quite a few airline crews and business meetings. But, for a vacation with the family, I think I would pick something further away from the edge of the Tenderloin.	
Apr 1 2009 	Nice but not cheap!	The location is great as it is right by Union Square. The rooms were ok but not anything special, all very clean and comfortable.We booked in advance as were told that they are likley to be busy and we wanted a nice place to stay for a few days at the end of our round the world trip. As a result we paid alot for the room, infact about three times the amount than if we had booked the day before we stayed!!In the end this is a nice clean hotel in a good location, but its room rate are very high so if you do want ot stay there it might be best to leave booking until just before you arrive the difference when we were there was massive. (We paid over £100 per night in advance and a couple we met who booked online the day before arriving paid about £30)Is it worth £30 per night? of course! is it worth over £100 per night? Im not sure there are plenty of other hotels in San Francisco! I would recommend this hotel to a friend, but only as a book on arrival option.	
Apr 1 2009 	Sleepless in San Francisco	Nice hotel and close to all the tourist locations, very close to shopping area. The rooms are large and very comfortable with coffee and tea facilities.Nice little cafe next door for breakfast, toasted sandwiches and pastries, very good value.The noise.... between 11pm and 5am all you can hear is the bin collectors. Every nght the same. If you can sleep with ear plugs you will be fine.I would probably use the hotel again, but ask for a much higher floor. Must be above 15th floor.Hotel would benefit from double glazing..........	
Mar 31 2009 	Very good hotel in great downtown location close to all the Union Square action	My wife and I stayed here for a 5 night holiday break and overall had a mixed experience. The initial check-in was smooth and courteous and our room on the 21st floor with a Bay view was high enough to escape the constant city noise. However, our second night there was wrecked by very noisy and uncouth guests next door. (The bad language was unbelievable!!) Next morning, we checked with the front desk who confirmed that those guests had checked out. Whew!! Next evening, the same mayhem, so we checked again with front desk only to be told that they had checked back in!! Insisting on a move, we were given a larger corner room on the 25th floor, with a City view, which was considerably less scenic than our previous Bay view. Overall, the standard of the rooms was very good, but in the second room, we had a shower which leaked all over the floor and also an air extraction vent which never switched off and in fact blew cold air out 24/7. There were also 2 occasions when our magnetic room keys barred us from entering our room. The front desk never really explained why that was happening to us, but merely gave us replacements and on the second occasion, the same lady who initially checked us in actually asked us for proof of ID before handing over our new keys!!!	
Mar 30 2009 	Excellent Hotel	We have stayed at the Parc 55 Hotel numerous times. I can't say enough about this hotel....comfortable beds, super clean, friendly staff and most of the the time, reasonable prices. We use to live in the Bay Area but now live in AZ and stay at the Parc 55 3 or 4 times a year. We have stayed at several different hotels in the Union Square area....the Parc 55 is always our first choice!	
Mar 27 2009 	Cancellation policy is 72 hours in advanced. Don't stay there!	If you don't care about cancellation fees of 72 hours in advanced -this hotel is for you!!!! If you do care about it since there is always a chance that something can happen at the very last minute of your trip, DO NOT stay at this hotel! Even if you talk to the manager of the hotel with more than two days and a half in advance, the manager will not wave you the cancellation penalty....YOU'LL HAVE TO PAY THE FEE... You need to call by 4:00pm 72 in advance!!! In addition, although I've never been in San Francisco I've seeing many more hotels in the internet that looks much nicer, with better prices and without that 72 hours cancellation fee. So why staying on this hotel?...My advice is AVOID Parc 55!!	
Mar 25 2009 	Nice hotel great location	Stayed three nights here, March 8-11, 2009. Had been in the Harbor Court for one night before this, and was nice to get to this hotel and the larger room! We got there early and were not able to check in, so we left our luggage with the bellhop while we got something to eat and did a little sightseeing. Upon our return at 1:30pm we were able to check in. We were assigned a room on the 26th floor with a view of City Hall and the residential hills in the distance.Room was spacious, bed was soft but comfortable. Bathroom was functional with all the usual amenities. We had a problem with the TV one night but someone came to fix it within 30 minutes. All public areas were kept very clean. Location was one block from the Powell Street cable car turnaround and the Powell Street Bart/Muni Station which was very convenient. Plenty of restaurants and shopping within walking distance. We even walked from the Hotel to Chinatown two days, and from the Hotel to Coit Tower via Chinatown and on to Embarcadero Street to take the F-Line to Pier 39. Great exercise!The Parc 55 Hotel was a great value through Priceline and I was happy with our experience.	
Mar 25 2009 	Lobby under renovation $13 net nasty ID policy fee for late checkout	The Parc55 not only wants to see photo ID, they record the number of that ID, which I find disturbing (SF isn't a police state, folks!).Down duvets, good pillows, fluffy 100% cotton towels.Both wired and wireless net, each $13/day. Had some trouble getting connected, but tech support was fast and helpful.Adjustable desk chairs that lock upright. Four power outlets right next to the desk, but none near the beds. Flat panel TV. No coffee maker, refrigerator, microwave, or minibar. The lobby escalators are undergoing renovation, which leaves getting in and out of the hotel to be a bit of a maze.They wouldn't offer a checkout later than than 12:30pm without a surcharge.Reasonably competent desk staff and fast response to maintenance issues, but the housekeepers spoke too little English to understand simple questions. All-in-all, a fine place to stay.	
Mar 23 2009 	Location excellent delightful city but beware noise from traffic!	Our trip was a quick four days from UK! Location was excellent as very convenient from Bart(Powell) less than 200metres away making easy access and cheap access from the airport. Rooms tidy and clean and well appointed. reception little slow but in fairness whole area in renovation. Housekeeping staff friendly and exceedingly helpful, in fact in many years travelling some of the best. Advice though if English take a supply of decent tea bags! For leisure travellers convenient for all public transport with cable car right next door(to Fisherman's Wharf). The Wharf warrants one day but no more as very tacky( enjoy meal at Wines of California at end of pier)! The Golden Gate Bridge worth seeing(take bus to bridge 5 then 28) and walk across .... remarkably few people do ... on to the peaceful town of Sausalito returning by ferry to the Ferry Terminal via Alcatraz .... with lunch at Socama's(super halibut and Dungeness Crab). from Ferry Terminal take cable car from Market Street up to Powell then join at intersection car from the Wharf,Area near Parc 55 very pleasant with Union Square 5 minutes away. Enjoy a coffee and croissant in the square. Plenty of good eating houses around, try Italian across from the hotel(great value Happy Hour 4-6). Beware price of wine if from UK. A bottle from a liquor store of local wine $20 upwards, buy at Heathrow(3 bottles $26!). for shopping Parc 55 just opposite Westfield, ultra modern cathedral to consumerism. Go to top level above Bloomingdale's to see what I mean.Good value Internet cafe at rear of hotel($3.50 for 30 minutes)Parc excellent value if seek Internet prices. Only real downside is the traffic noise particularly on lower floors(we were on 11th) however sirens and rubbish collections noises will be encountered where ever you stay in this super city.Trip capped by two excellent flights by BA! on time, excellent service and very comfortable seats.	
Mar 22 2009 	Great Value for Money	Booked this place via Priceline and it was a real steal! This is a well located hotel near Union Sq and great for shopping and seeing the city. The service was good as they accommodated all of our requests, including being put onto a high floor, to minimise noise. The rooms themselves were of a very good standard and were up to scratch for a 4 star hotel, especially when we were upgraded.We didn't try the bar or any of the facilities of the hotel during the stay, but did not encounter any of the staff unfriendliness eluded to by some articles. Parking is very expensive ($55) and it is recommended that you park your car yourself in the nearby garage at 5th and Mission for $30 for 12-24 hours.The have undergone some refurbishment work and have changed their check in location and this makes the place look very smart indeed. Some work needs to be done to the dated entrance area though.All in all if you want somewhere central and nice to rest your head at the end of the night, this is the place for you as it is a bargain. If you want to spend more time at the hotel rather than the city, look elsewhere.	
Mar 20 2009 	Service not worth the money.	Staff was unhelpful and unfriendly, yet waited expectantly for tipping. (fat chance!) No help offered by bellmen when struggling with luggage-not a good first impression. Front desk was quick to promote hotel restaurant, but when asked what they served/offered they had very little information. Room was very similar to a Holiday Inn Express-minimal decor, plain walls. The walls were very thin and we could hear everything (EVERYthing) going on next door as well as in the hallways. The view of Market Street was redeeming, unless you were trying to sleep-then the noise from outside could be unbearable. If staying for a short business trip, being in the heart of downtown would be convenient, however if on vacation or looking for good customer service, this is not the right place for you.	
Mar 18 2009 	service similar to a boutique kimpton property	I just returned with my 15 year old daughter, her 16 year old friend, as well as her mother from a pleasant stay at Parc 55. We were celebrating our girls 16th birthdays. Our late flight put us at the hotel at 12:20 a.m., no problem for the front desk, we were checked in and unpacking our bags within 20 minutes of arrival. We stayed on the 32nd floor, with a sweeping view of the city, I could see the TransAmerica building, the water and a bit of the golden gate bridge. I am a light sleeper, but the room I was in was quiet &amp; I never heard my neighbors. No clanging dumpster noise at 5:00 a.m., something I've experienced at other properties in San Francisco. The room is tastfully remodelled with light duvet covers, and very comfortable beds that felt like new mattresses. The beds are doubles, so for 2 adult women with teen-age daughters it was a bit on the cozy side, but I expected this. I am a substitute teacher on a budget, so I will trade close quarters for a great price.  Our room included a hospitality room on the 31st floor, staff was friendly, efficient, and promptly restocked fresh fruit, strawberries and the chocolate croissants that my daughter and I became addicted to. Staff helped me plan my sight-seeing, and I want to personally offer a shout out thank-you to Robert for suggestions on restaurants and the seam-less service he provided during our stay. We did not have a car, but I've never understood why you would want one in a major city. Cars are a liablity in a major city in my opinion, so I would suggest you dump the rental car after the Napa wine tasting. You always pay through the nose for parking, no matter what the city. So maybe if you need cheap parking and that is a priority, you might want to shop around. The Bart system is right around the corner, cable-cars and muni all conveniently located. Muni drivers should be commended for their polite answers about transferring etc. since there are no bus schedules and they have to constantly put up with tourists asking how to get around. Mr. Newsom might want to look into resources here, since tourism is the 2nd biggest industry for San Francisco next to Financial. And it looks like financial is in for a bit of a dry spell.This hotel is in a terrific location, heart of shopping, 10 minute walk to Chinatown. cable-cars on the next street. Which leads me to safety. I was travelling with my 16 year old daughter, we are suburban people and I never felt frightened around this property. Are there homeless people in San Francisco and occasionally in front of our hotel? Yes. And the doorman and attendants do a fine job of keeping an eye on things. I am also not going out for a stroll at 2:00 a.m. along Geary street. We did however, stay out until around 11:00 p.m, walking back from a financial district restaurant.The lobby remodel was completed on our last day, there are large groovy white light fixtures to admire. Front desk held our bags for 4 hours while we did some last minute sight-seeing before our flight.I have stayed at many of the Kimpton properties in this city and typically prefer a smaller boutique type hotel. I honestly found service to be similar in attention to detail and friendliness of staff. I would highly reccommend this hotel to a friend.	
Mar 13 2009 	Great value	My wife and I stayed here on our babymoon. The location is good, but the neighborhood gets a little sketchy only a couple of blocks west. The rooms were very nice, only complaint was a little too much street noise. Very close to the BART, trolley cars and public transportation. Would definitely go back.	
Mar 7 2009 	Great Location Price ... and Fabulous Service!	I love everything about this hotel! It is right at the Powell Street Bart Bart stop, so I can get to and from the airport in under ½ an hour (usually much faster than driving). The workout facilities are great, and the proximity to shopping, baseball, Union Square, is perfect. The great internet deals make it my must stay choice in San Francisco. I checked in after a day of Travel Hell (snowed out of my ski vacation, then flights delayed for hours, pouring rain in the city). The manager, Deanna, was incredibly sympathetic to all that Id been through, and sent wine up to my room, which was exactly what I needed at the time. This is the kind of gesture I expect from an expensive boutique hotel, but for $100 a night? Too awesome!	
Mar 5 2009 	Great Location But Dated	Have picked up great rates through Priceline at the Parc 55. Travel to SFO about once a quarter and have stayed at most of the 4-stars in the area. Use Priceline to bid. I am always getting 4-stars for $70-85 range around the downtown area. The Parc 55 is right at the southern edge of Union Square. Easy walk to the area, great restuarants and shopping. The hotel is nice. I dont know if it is a true 4-star, but not far off. It is a little dated regarding decor and such (lots of mirrors), but they are updating. It is a very large hotel. Considering its size, not that large a lobby or common areas. Very much like a NY hotel.The rooms are large and well appointed. Good staff. Can get a good view if in the right spot. Other times could be staring into office building next door.Did not eat at the hotel. So many great places around, never wanted too. Great service, location and value. Will stay again.	
Mar 3 2009 	THIS PLACE IS GREAT!! Read on and find out why...	So for about $100 give or take depending on the when you stay, you can't go wrong. It is clean, updated, well located (right across from Bart station, Nordies, etc...) Service is wonderful too. It's a no nonsense business or pleasure hotel. I know my friends stay here too and always return. Unless you are looking for super posh and luxurious...or quaint and small...BOOK IT!! You won't go wrong. :)	
Mar 3 2009 	Not a lot to like really	Stayed with my wife for 2 nights after some winetasting in Napa.We asked for a high floor but got 13... not bad, I guess.. but you could still hear road noise from here. The bed was comfortable and the room clean. It passed the shower hot water test that I'm fussy about. The reception staff were nice and courteous, as were the valets. The parking rate was outrageous - $44 a night plus taxes. Two nights of parking cost us over $105... compare that to 5 days of car rental at $185 and you can see why I was annoyed. The only saving grace was the in/out privileges for that price. On top of that they made a mistake on our bill and charged us for 3 nights of parking - duplicate billing the first night.The bar on the second floor is a must-miss. It looks like part of a Denny's... maybe not even that good. The hotel is located in a pretty seedy part of town so be warned that you're going to want to watch where you go in the evenings.All-in-all it was a so-so experience. I can't say it was bad but I can't say it was great either.	
Feb 25 2009 	Nice corner rooms with great views	Well to start with I saw a lot of poor reviews on this place but they were contrary to my experience. I arrived around 1:30pm on a Friday I had no trouble checking in, they set me up with a corner room with a king bed, which is the way to go, 2 big panorama bay windows on separate walls with spectacular views. Furnishings were nice with dark cabinets and desk, (see hotel photos) nice color schemes, well designed. Nice big flat screen TV, nice bathroom a little smallish but well laid out and not at all cramped feeling. On a side note I booked through a name your own price type website and got a weekend rate of $78.00 per night, so at that price Id be hard pressed to complain about this joint. The beds were very comfortable with nice soft white sheets and comfy pillows. Also the bedspreads were nice fluffy duvets with white removable covers, you may read this as clean as opposed to bedspreads with who knows what on them, big plus if you ask me. I had very little interaction with the hotel staff aside from check-in, bell desk and the valet parking attendants who were a constant as they happily whisked my car in and out of their lot over and over again. By the way parking here is on the spendy side at $44.00 plus taxes and fees per night, ($50.00 total, and dont forget tips) but considering my use it seemed alright to me. I think the parking staff got the drift and kept my car close by as after a few trips my car always seemed to be there moments after I hit the lobby doors, proper tipping doesnt hurt in situations like that which may have explained why I seemed to fly by others waiting for cars to be brought up. All in all I liked the hotel, stylish and clean room, desk with a view, nice couch, convenient location, little need to interact with front desk staff. I think a corner room with a king is the difference between my experience and the poor reviews Ive read. Have a look at the hotel photos and you can see from the exterior shots the 2 windows on the corner rooms, and if you look through the photos you will see an interior shot of the corner rooms with 2 windows. remember some people only review hotels they dont like grrrrr Ill show them, I take really nasty reviews with a grain of salt but hey thats just me. Dont know the regular rate but Im a brave soul and book on the bid system often, most times it works out for me, this time it did. So go, have fun, enjoy San Francisco and if you are very particular then just book a Starwood Hotel and be done with it, the W hotel in SF is a very nice joint, so is the St Francis, even the Palace is alright, Im fine at all of those as well as the Parc55, heck I have no problem with Parc55 at all, I would go back. Oh and as far as noise goes, this is the city good luck no matter where you go.	
Feb 21 2009 	STAY AWAY FROM THIS HOTEL!!!	I love to travel and usually stay at 3 to 5 stars hotels. My expectations are very fair. I don't really have high standards or by any means high maintness. As long as these hotels and rooms are somewhat similar to the pictures I see in their websites and providing decent level of service then I'm satisfied. But this hotel is far from any of it!Rooms are nothing like what they show you in their site, they are very small with small windows. Beds are very uncomfortable and bathrooms are small but ok. Hotel itself is ok from outside looks good but inside looks like old burned down hospital.Worst thing about this place was their service. I was at the front desk at least 4 times a day to solve one problem after another. from my hotel bill to not being able to get to my room to being charged 4 internet charge all in less then an hour. on the first day my frinds and I checked in at the same time they gave both of us wrong keys to our room! Club level was terrible as well....I hope think twice before staying at this hotel and don't make the same mistake we made. This is San Francisco and you have alot of hotels to choose from so choose wisely!!!	
Feb 20 2009 	Good Location	Stayed for an overnighter at the Parc 55 at the end of a business trip. Hotel is in a great location, a minute or so from Union Square and cable cars. Room was very nice - I got upgraded to a corner suite which was spacious and clean. Air con was a bit iffy, otherwise a well proportioned room.Worry is that currently, the hotel is undergoing major renovation - especially in the public areas (dining rooms etc). Web site does not make it very clear, so either wait a while for the work to finish, or ignore it and enjoy the rooms.For such a large hotel, the bar was small and not very welcoming. Bar Menu looked good (didn't eat) and the few people that were in there made for little atmoshpere.Good value for money, but would wait a few months for the renovations to be completed before I stay there again.	
Feb 19 2009 	Nice Hotel Great Location Comfy Beds	Spent 1 night in the City and chose the Parc 55 for its convenience and location to Union Square. We received an excellent rate from their website and like another reviewer as time drew closer to the reservation, I realized that good rate had gotten even better, and yes it was easily changed. We arrived well ahead of check-in and had no problems with gaining access to our roomWe have a club level room on the 27th floor with a wonderful view. The room was a nice size and the bed was very comfortable. Staff was good, continental breakfast was good and the bell staff was very friendly.The only draw back is the huge fee of $44 to park your car overnight. Room was a corner room on 27th floor with panoramic windows. Despite the fee I see no reason not to give the Parc 55 a try.	
Feb 18 2009 	Good location Bad Customer service	We stayed at Parc 55 this past weekend for Valentine's day. After reading reviews I arrived knowing that they will not grant early check-ins but I tried anyway. I was told that the rooms were not available until 3pm and to check back in. At 2:50 I got back in life (the line was always very long) and by the time I got to the front desk again it was after 3pm. Surprise surprise my room of course was still not ready. All they have available was standard double bed rooms and I had requested a King room with a view. I was told they they would rush house keeping to get my room ready since I explained that we needed to go to our rooms to change asap.. I returned again 30 minutes later and was told it would be another hour to hour and a half because they were &quot;behind&quot;. At this point I was extremely upset and asked whether I would be allowed to check out late since they are making me check in hours past check in time. The rude front desk person said absolutely not and there was nothing they can do. We had to leave for an appointment and we were finally able to check in when we returned at 6:45pm. It seems like the people at the front desk don't have any customer service skills and they don't really care about our business because they already have alot of business from airlines and conventions. Although I was extremely unsatisfied with the service I am giving this hotel a 3 because the view from our room was wonderful and the beds were super comfy. Also, the location was perfect and they have a very good thai restaurant.	
Feb 16 2009 	Never again	The 2 rating is for my previous stays. The view rooms are clean, comfy, and modern. Didnt have trouble with noise issues on the upper floors. Great central location and price is affordable with their specials. However, after my stay this past weekend, I will never patronize them again.I booked a view king 2 months prior in anticipation of Valentines Day. Upon arrival at 5:30, the receptionist insisted I had booked a double and tried to check me into one. Uh, I dont think so. I overhear others mention that they are fully booked and view kings wouldnt be available for at least 2 hours. She tells me the same. Normally it would not be an issue, however I needed to prepare and had dinner reservations at 7:30. Long story short, I ended up with a smoking king on the 8th floor, which turned out to be two doubles when I arrived at the room. I was over it at this point. The room itself, aside from the smokey halls, was clean and furnished the same as my previous stays. If youre a light sleeper as I am, be prepared for a restless night. Theres a reason they provide earplugs. Overall, their lack of care and concern is troublesome. They didnt even bother to refund part of my rate until I mentioned it. This hotel is large and caters to conference goers and airline crews, so I doubt they care about the occasional traveler. Dont be enticed by the low rates. All it brings about is uncertainty. They couldnt pay me to stay here again  ever.	
Feb 12 2009 	Favorite hotel in SF	We live very close to San Francisco, but when we are really going out on the town we always stay the night. Usually we do Priceline's Bid Your Own and enter &quot;Union Square East, 4 star.&quot; We either get Westin St. Francis, Hilton on O'Farrell St or Parc 55. We always hope to get Parc 55. Hilton is nice because you can park a little cheaper right across the street in the garage, but Parc 55's rooms are so so nice. They are plush with big bay windows, sometimes two of them. Every room I have ever had here has had a really nice view. The rooms are spacious and sometimes quite spacious. If you are lucky enough to get the corner rooms, wow! All that for 90 to 130 USD depending on the time of year. My favorite hotel in the City for location and value!! Oh, and by the way, if you read really bad reviews, double click on the reviewer's name and see how many reviews they have. If they have only one or all of their reviews have been poor, then you know what you're dealing with. If you are still unsure, send them a message and see if they respond!	
Feb 9 2009 	Very Nice Stay at Parc 55	Booked 3-night reservation directly with Parc 55's website for a very good rate. As time drew closer to the reservation, realized that good rates had gotten even better. Easily changed reservation to a club level room for same cost as original reservation.Room was a corner room on 27th floor with panoramic windows. Very spacious and very comfortable bed. Air conditioning was less than adequate (even for January), especially during the day when sun beat on the windows and curtains were drawn. Housekeeping service was not very good - we were gone much of Saturday, returning after 3 pm, and maid still hadn't done our room. Even on 27th floor there was quite a bit of noise at night from the street. And the restaurant(s) were frankly a joke considering the size of the hotel. But since we were so centrally located other than the first night when we arrived we never used the restaurant or bar inside the hotel again.Because of it's awesome location and wonderful rate I would stay there again in a heartbeat. There is so much they could do to make the hotel better but we received wonderful value for the rate we paid for the 3 nights we stayed at the end of January.	
Feb 8 2009 	Best location in the city	We stayed here with our four year old daughter for four nights at the end iof January, using it as a place to stay while we checked out San Francisco.As others have said, the location could not be better. The Powell- Hyde cable car line is across the road which gives access straight to Union Square (only a couple of blocks away anyway) right down to the piers on the waterfront for $5 a ride (cheaper if you buy mutlipass tickets). Tourist Information office is just adjacent to it too, as is the giant five floor shopping mall with Bloomingdales in it. It is used by a lcouple of airlines to put their staff up in, and that's a good recommendation for me - they wouldn't place them somewhere bad!Rooms were a good size and well maintained, staff were very good. Airport is a ten minute $40 trip away.We did have a problem when checking out when we were charged for a breakfast we had never had, but this was dealt with quickly and removed from our bill no bother.Overall, we were very happy with our stay at this hotel.	
Feb 3 2009 	Extremely Pleased	After reading some unfavorable reviews about this hotel, I was very skeptical about booking here. However, there were other reviews that were much better so I decided to take a chance. I was very pleasantly surprised with the whole experience! I believe the rooms have been recently updated - nice flat screen TV's and very soft and comfortable bed linens. The staff was very friendly and helpful with every question I had. The location of this hotel can't be beat - a five minute walk to Union Square and a 1 minute walk to the BART station. The Westfield mall - a 2-minute walk away has a fantastic food court in the lower level which makes it convenient and reasonable to eat - a real plus. You,re also only a 2 minute walk to the trolly turn- around. We did not eat in the hotel restaurant - (it has been temporarily moved to a different location in the hotel due to remodeling) - but the menu looked good...although the breakfast seemed a bit pricey. We stayed for five days and got what I thought was a great price on this hotel through a package deal with hotels.com I would definitley reccomend this hotel to any traveler!B.R. - Baltimore, MD	
Feb 2 2009 	Loved Parc 55	Just stayed at the Parc 55 Hotel and what a fabulous Hotel, newly remodeled, very clean, very helpful staff. The location of the hotel is perfect. We rode BART from SFO, got off at Powell and literally walked across the street to the hotel, it couldn't have been more convienient. The Cable Car is right there as well. Nice restaurants and plenty of shopping all within walking distance. Very enjoyable stay and will definitely come back.	
Jan 25 2009 	Just by the underground and cable car	Check in and out quick and friendly. Questions answered with knowledge and a smile. No in room safe but reception has free security boxes. Room clean, comfortable and with a view. Stayed four days and it was a great base to explore the city. Yes there are vaigrants in close prox but these cup people ARE all over the city not just by this hotel. Fishermans wharf very very quiet. Feeling the pinch. A walk to the Golden Gate Bridge is for the fit but the reward is worth it, a bike can be hired from many shops but carry photo id just in case they require it. Told of a bar down Haight st just short of Filmore st called Toronado. 50 beers. Bar staff very knowledgable, so just ask for the style you like and hay presto one will appear thats just right. A walk through the San F gardens also well worth it.	
Jan 25 2009 	Good Rate Great Location	My wife and I needed lodging for a night out in the city close to the Warfield for a music venue.My buddy was staying at the Park 55 and we decided to gve it a shot.I read countless reviews some better than other but decided to keep an open mind and give this property a chance.The location was perfect for our needs and I booked through the hotels web site and found a great deal on a renovated king room that included parking for our vehicle.Room was clean and had a nice view it was a corner unit.The 2nd floor resturant it self was a joke.It looked more like an employee calfiteria.We met friend for a drink before heading out for the evening.All in all if I were to get the same rate with the inclusive parking deal I would stay at this property again.	
Jan 24 2009 	Great Location!	Stayed here for 4 nights in November, and really had no problems. Room was nice with a large bathroom. Clean, comfortable beds, pleasant people and the hotel is in a very convenient location. Will definitely consider staying here again, if they run a special. Parking charge is terrible, but that's San Francisco! One comment I will make is the bar was pretty pricey in their drink charges, so beware!	
Jan 23 2009 	Horrible Hotel - Completely Overrated - STAY SOMEPLACE ELSE!	100% overrated. Do not fall for the &quot;4-star&quot; rating as I did, the Parc 55 is basically a Super 8 Motel that added some additional features to earn 4 stars (like putting an old phone in the bathroom). The room service was basically frozen food that was microwaved and they turn down the intensity of the a/c at about 10:30am each day to save themselves money but that means that if you're in the room after that, you'll sweat a lot (as I did each day!). The hotel staff are not friendly (except for the house keepers) and when I complained I didn't even receive a call back. I complained again and asked for the manager to call me but nothing. The area is also not that safe at night as there were a lot of vagrants around starting at sundown. Oh, and parking is $50 per day... yes, $50 (with tax)!!! Across the street at a much nicer boutique hotel, they were charging only $25 per day.You may think you are getting a good price by staying here but if you are truly used to 4 or 5 star hotels, this will utterly disappoint. If you are used to 2 start hotels, then this is the hotel for you.I was fooled by all the good reviews online at most travel sites but after looking at many of them, it is obvious they are reviews posted by the hotel themselves just to pull people in. Don't be fooled by those pseudo-reviews... this hotel is awful and there are many (MANY!) better places to stay in SF. Don't suffer as we did... stay someplace else.I HIGHLY recommend you stay someplace else.	
Jan 21 2009 	Its the little things that could have counted	I stayed at the Parc 55 for a few days prior to my trip to Australia. I had chosen it because of its location, and that certainly didn't disappoint. A block to the trolley cars and to Market Street, a couple blocks to Union Square - it was all so close.This is clearly a hotel made for meetings, conventions and airline staff. Us other folks were pretty much ignored or stared at by the staff - somewhat disconcerting. I went looking for the hotel restaurant one morning, taking the escalator right next to the bell station and the four or five bellmen there just stared at me as I went up, and then again as I came down a few minutes later. Here is a thought: instead of staring why not mention that you can't get to the restaurant that way? Why not move the big sign for the restaurant from next to the escalators and put it next to the elevators, as that is the only way to get there?I also got the stare when I tried to find a way into the hotel from Ellis Street. In fact, despite seeing lots of people struggling with their bags, the only thing I ever saw the bell men do was stare blankly at people...If you are going to stay, try and get a high level floor. I was on one of the lower floors, which provided a lot of traffic noise and no view. I am used to that so I wasn't too upset by the former, but the view provided gave me a direct look into the apartments of the people across the street.Another problem with low floors is that it is impossible to get on an elevator on your checkout date. I waited for almost half an hour, watching full elevator car after car go by, unable to get me and my heavy international suitcases in. I finally ended up taking a car up and then coming down again.All of those things are sort of expected in a hotel, so I could put up with them. The one thing I did wish was fixable was the thickness of walls. On my last night there was a large Christmas party being held at the hotel, with many folks staying over. The people in the room next door returned to their room VERY noisily around 3 a.m. and were quite active for a while after (he likes to the called &quot;the King&quot; if you get my drift).Still, the room itself was very large, water pressure int he shower was great and the bed was WONDERFUL!	
Jan 11 2009 	Never never again	DONT GO THERE!!!! They are stealing me money!! I stayed there 3 nights for a conference, then when I wanned to check out they wanned to charge me two breakfast that I never had. I complained and they said they were no going to charge it, but now I have just come home and saw that they did it!! They are just stealing me money!! Now I am in Europe and I have to spend I don't know how much money calling them for cancelling that if they want!! The place is ok, but as good as any other 4 stars hotel, you don't get a penny more than what you pay. I honestly don't recommend it at all!!	
Jan 8 2009 	NEVER AGAIN!!!	N E V E R A G A I N !!!!!I'd stayed here twice prior to my last experience and had an o-k stay. I booked a room online for my bf and I when we were thinking of going to the city for New Year's eve to have dinner but then we changed our plans so I cancelled the reservation online the next day. I ended up getting charged $234.00 anyway, and when I called to have the charge credited back to me, it took them 3 days to call me back and then they refused to credit me because they were unable to find the cancelation in their system. Please don't stay here...I wrote a long complaint letter to the hotel manager, so we'll see if I even hear back. Maybe they don't care about service because they have contracts with airlines because I always see flight attendants leaving....	
Jan 6 2009 	Very Nice Hotel	After seeing this hotel during a tour on the cable car, we walked in to see if they had any rooms available for that night. They told us they were completely booked and if they had any rooms, they were $229 per night. We then went outside and used my husband's phone to call Hotels.com. They immediately booked us a room in this same hotel for only $119.00. It was a very nice hotel and a beautiful view of downtown San Francisco. It's not something I would do all the time but nice for one night.	
Jan 6 2009 	Hey - were you born in a barn???	We stayed at Park55 for NYE. The room was very nice, clean and comfortable. BUT, what the heck is up with people slamming doors all night long??? I have stayed at some really nice hotels in my day, and Park55 is what I consider a nice hotel. Great location, large clean room, attentive staff, nice views, etc. . . but one thing they have not conquered is how to design a hotel room door that does not slam to the point of rattling the walls all the way down the hall. I think I lost a molar at one point. We were located at one end of the building, in a little alcove, so I thought we were pretty secluded. BUT NOOOOOO. . . . all night long. . . BAM BAM BAM. . . And, to save the hotel 100% responsibility for this, have the people that STAY at the hotel not figured out that if THEY shut the door easily, it won't slam ??? Think about it the next time you travel.	
Jan 5 2009 	Pleasurable Parc 55	This was my first stay but not my last at the Parc 55. I arrived in the late afternoon on New Year's Eve. The streets around downtown SF were packed with visitors as was the hotel lobby. I'd estimate there were at least 50 people checking in ahead of me. However, the professional desk staff greeted each person with a smile and never lost their cool. I asked for an upper floor room and they gave me a choice of three. I selected a room on the 19th floor facing Market Street. It was exactly as the pics. on their website. Very nicely refurbished with a goiod size bathroom, large flat screen TV and sensational views.The entire hotel, including my room, the hallways and public areas are very clean and neat. One caveat, the room would be smallish for more than two people. Great for a single person or couple, but probably a bit snug for families.	
Dec 29 2008 	Highly recommended	We stayed here around our 30th wedding anniversary. We had a Club room next to the Executive Club Lounge with complimentary cold buffet breakfast and evening hors d'oeuvres. We didnt have a car, and the disabled entrance is in the parking bay which I thought a tad odd, though a reasonable compromise. Quite often, I would tell my wife to go into the main entrance, while I dashed around. As a disabled person, the whole infrastructure at San Francisco was the best I have ever encountered anywhere in the world. The room was huge and exceptionally clean comprising of a kitchenette (with two types of fully stocked coffee makers), dining and living area, and two bathrooms. The views were excellent and we didnt really notice any noise either from traffic or from other guests meaning that the walls were well insulated. A request for a fridge for medication was responded to within 15 mins of arrival. All the hotel staff were very amicable, especially the executive lounge hosts and the doorman who was full of information and always very helpful. The only criticism is that checkin was quick in our case, but we often noticed queues of around 5 -10 mins. Not really an issue for us as we only needed to go there on arrival and departure. I highly recommend this hotel if staying at Club Level and want to be close to Union Square. We would certainly not hesitate to book again.	
Dec 22 2008 	Great location service needs work	For room a city view room with 2dbl beds spitting distance from Union Square and SF Center at under $140/nite, you can't beat this place. The hotel is just steps from the cable car turnaround on Powell, and directly across the street from the entrance to the new Westfield mall. While this is not a luxury upscale type of place, it is a good value for the money. With newly renovated rooms, reasonable rates and it's convenient location right off Union Square and directly across the street from the Westfield shopping center - this was the perfect hotel for a holiday shopping weekend in the city. Despite it's small size, the newly renovated rooms are pretty comfortable and very clean. Carpets are all fresh and clean, bathrooms were all clean with the usual basic amenities, and our room on the 23rd floor had a great view of the city, with glimpses of the bay winking at us between the skyscrapers. There's not much in terms of restaurant/bar scene in this hotel, but your just steps away from some amazing restaurants and bars right outside the hotel. Do not expect bellmen to help you with your bags, they seem to be few and far between, or even for the front desk to get your room billing correct - we had a snafu with them refusing to put room and tax for the three rooms i reserved on my bill, even though i'd specifically requested they not show the bill to my guests 3x - but what can you do? Breakfast buffet in the hotel is serviceable, but really, for $20pp you can get an amazing meal just right outside the door of the hotel. The lone bar in the hotel seems to close down by 11pm - but again, why stay in the hotel when you're in SF? Good value and would probably stay again.	
Dec 17 2008 	This hotel sucks!!!	Not only does this hotel have horrible service but the noise from outside can be heard all through the night (even on the top floors).	
Dec 14 2008 	Good Central Hotel	A good city-centre hotel. Close to the cable car, tour buses, shopping, cinema etc.Good size rooms with a huge bathroom. Hotel is used by a lot of the airline staff (BA etc) so it must be decent!Make sure you leave plenty of time for checking out as it can get very busy and there are only a few desks.	
Dec 9 2008 	could be better....	it was not perfect i tell you!they had great deal on parking package, and that's the reason i chose this hotel over others.when i entered the room, it was not bad, it's smaller than i thought, but we are in SF rite.i found those things are not acceptable when i stepped in the room1. cigarette burnt towel2. stained bath tub3. HUMAN HAIR ON THE BED! Which is very very very disgustingi called the for housekeeping, waited for quite a long time.but the service was nice and quick.the other thing are not acceptable are:1. really bad tones over the phone (one is jenny and one i forgot)2. takes long time to pick up the phone3. concierge is almost never there (and that's wat i need)the hotel is old, but not that bad, some are not nice, but the valet people are polite compare to others.the location is great tho. very close to every major shopping places, and close to union square (but seriously there are not much things to do at union square, seriously!)after all, it was not a bad trip.oh it has a sofa bed (single size) so if u wanna save money and crush with friends, u can do that	
Dec 4 2008 	Love love love this hotel!	This hotel is fabulous....location, excellent! It was beautiful, clean, well-staffed and felt ultra upscale without an ultra upscale price. We had the most gorgeous view with enormous picture windows on two side of our room. It felt wonderful to come home to at the end of each long sight seeing day. Will definitely stay again on our next trip to San Fran!	
Dec 4 2008 	Great Hotel Fabulous City!	My husband and I stayed here as part of our honeymoon. The location could not be faulted, really close to Union Square and the Trolly lines. We arrived a little later than planned due a flight delay, so just ordered some room service, and I've never had such delicious French Onion soup in my life!The room was great, the staff were all very helpful and pleasant, and we had no complaints what so ever!Would love to stay there again!	
Dec 4 2008	Location Location Location	Stayed here for a week after a cruise. Location was perfect as close to Union Square &amp; easy access to all local transport. A few pan handlers in area as close to the Tenderloin but no concerns about safety. The hotel itself would not win any beauty contests as quite bland (apart from the bedrooms) but very comfortable and clean. Reception staff were always very friendly, allowed us to check in at 8am and also upgraded us! Busy hotel and particularly popular with airline staff. Before arrival I had concerns about excess noise as had read previous reviews. The hotel had provided ear plugs which I used on occasions because I'm a light sleeper. I didn't have any problems with noise.	
Dec 3 2008 	Great location nice hotel	We stayed here in early November after touring CSUSF with our 17-year old daughter - wanted to get a little shopping in while in the City. This is a nice hotel - the rooms are spacious, nicely furnished and clean. The shower was one of the best I have found in California. The staff was friendly and the price was reasonable too, but the location is what it's all about. Directly across the street from the Westfield Mall (Nordstrom, Bloomies, and hundreds of others), the cable car turnaround is steps away and Union Square is just two blocks up. It's right in the middle of the best shopping in SF. We are returning with friends for Christmas shopping and a night on the town - rooms are $99 starting on Dec 18. We've stayed at many of the hotels around Union Square over the years, and this is one of the best.	
Nov 30 2008 	Great location 	Spent 2 nights here in mid-November following a friend's recommendation. Wonderful location in the heart of downtown a stone's throw from the Cable Car terminus. Walking distance to great stores, restaurants and convenient to all of the major attractions. Rooms were clean, modern and extremely comfortable (our view from the 26th floor was magnificent!). Concierge was extremely helpful and staff very accomodating. Excellent value for the location (about $140 per night plus tax). Highly recommend.	
Nov 20 2008 	Good value in downtown SF	Parc 55 had a very good deal for a week's stay in November - the more nights you stayed, the lower the average rate per night. So, a week's stay worked out pretty well.The hotel itself is quite excellent (noticed a lot of airline crews staying there - always a good sign). Room quality and other creature comforts are of a high standard, as might be expected. The best feature, of course, is location - right in the middle of the downtown action. Close to Union Square for shopping and nightlife, and right beside the Powell St BART and Muni stops - ideal for airport connections as well as general public transport around the city (the wonderful F-line street car on Market St runs all the way down to Fisherman's Wharf or you can take the scenic route using the cable car).We didn't rent a car (no need) but the hotel did seem to have decent parking facilities.Bars and restauarants within the hotel were good, although we tended to eat elsewhere - given the wonderful selection of eateries and drinking emporiums all within ten minutes of the hotel (and no need for taxis either).Highly recommended if you can get a good deal on price.	
Nov 18 2008 	Would definitely stay here again!	The hotel is in a great location (right next to union square) and it's easy to get to. The rooms are spacious and have a great decor. We upgraded to the Club Level and were able to get free continental breakfast every morning. The staff were very friendly and always helpful. The only complaint would be the price of parking at the hotel, comes to about $51/night with tax but the valet staff is very attentive. We definitely enjoyed our stay and the hotel was a good deal for a large city.	
Nov 17 2008 	Ruined Our Anniversary!! :o(	We would like everyone to know that this anniversary weekend was completely ruined by the hotel and it's staff. How anyone stays there is beyond me with that kind of service and complete disregard for their guests well being. There are many things that I have listed that are completely the hotels fault and responsibility - I left a comment card and information regarding the concerns we had in the comment box in the lobby. I will go to all sites of reservations and let them know exactly what the hotel has done and not done and how it completely ruined our weekend. This weekend had been planned in advance and special request for a romantic anniversary was made and not delivered. Instead we were treated with disrespect and discourtesy. Not only did we not receive one apology for the hotels mishaps but we were treated this terribly from the moment we stepped foot into the lobby to the time we checked out this morning! * 11/14/08 arrived at hotel with itenerary in hand and the woman at the front desk did not have our reservation.*we were booked in a deluxe view room with a king bed, and they had booked all those and took that room away from us and gave us a standard double queen room with a view that seemed smaller!* once she found the reservation (5 minutes) she gave us the two room keys to room # 2520* we had been driving a while and were thirsty so we went to the hotel bar on the 2nd floor = when we asked for the check the waitress stated that our names were not in the computer and gave us someone else's name on that room number 2520.* we walked up to our floor 25 and our room 2520 and when we tried to open the room it would not allow us to. we were confused and tired and had to go back downstairs to get a new room?? a new key??* when we came back downstairs there were several people in line which we had to wait for 15 minutes to get a key and new room.* when we were helped the woman (a different one this time) did not really apologize and just said something that the original agent must have made a mistake and gave us our new key to a new room #2570* when we finally got the right room number and room keys we went up to our room there was absolutely nothing in the room that indicated that it was our anniversary or any special items left for us to enjoy... there was even no refridgerator!! It had been stated in the original booking that it was our anniversary and to make us a more romantic weekend - but not one &quot;happy anniversary&quot; or anything!*I came down around 3am to talk with a manager because I figured there would be no wait at the front desk. the night manager said that I should mention my concern to the daytime manager and also mentioned that booking with expedia you are not guaranteed your original booking... which I thought was completely absurd - shouldn't the hotel take good care of every guest - no matter who made the reservation???!?!!?!?*while staying on the 25th floor we got thirsty for a sprite - so I walked down the hall and put 2 dollar bills and one quarter ($2.25) for a sierra mist out of the vending machine and the money was stuck - so I called the front desk as referred by a hotel staff that noticed this, I called and was rudely told that I would have to come downstairs to the front desk and ask for a refund and you don't think that's sort of an inconvenience?? I would have bought a soda at the store if I had known there would have been such a problem!*for an evening of trying to make a terrible weekend turn a key - we decided to stay in and get a bottle of red wine to enjoy while we watched the view. I called to have some &quot;Kim Crawford&quot; pinot noir, it was listed in the menu in the room, I called room service and was told that they don't have that wine but they had &quot;Chalone&quot; pinot noir and that the bottle price wasn't listed but that it would be $40.00, when the bill came with the wine it was 55 dollars and was never informed what the $15.00 overcharge was for. Overall I would never recommend this hotel to anyone and would give very bad reviews to where ever we can to let people know that we were guests but were made to feel like outcasts at this Parc 55 hotel!	
Nov 13 2008 	Brilliant location excellent hotel!	We stayed here from 3rd-10th November whilst visiting San Francisco for a holiday and were not disappointed. We booked late- the night before so got a great deal. We arrived with not having had the best start to the holiday as my partner had lost his wallet on the plane, and the staff could not have been more helpful. They were so friendly and polite, and our room was upgraded to a king room with a view straightaway. The room itself wasn't huge, but plenty big enough- with an unbelievably comfy king-size bed. The view was just amazing- from the 24th floor we could see Union Square, the TransAmerica Pyramid, etc. The bathroom was very spacious, and the shower pressure was amazing- nearly knocked me off my feet! The only thing slightly disappointing was that internet access was charged for additionally- but that's a small point. We also had a large flatscreen TV, excellent climate control, and tea/coffee maker.Went to the hotel bar once, and the waiter was extremely friendly, and drinks were not expensive. However, DON'T eat in the hotel. The food was VERY poor quality for what you paid. I ordered the sea bass and I could swear I was given cod instead - didn't look at all like sea bass and my partner's pizza seemed to have been microwaved and he could not finish it. The restaurant itself is a tiny room at the back of the hotel- much like a disused conference room, and freezing cold. I recommend skipping this and going to one of the nearby restaurants- there are hundreds to choose from all at the same or better prices!The location of the hotel was excellent- literally seconds from the Muni Bart station, the cable car stop, the streetcar stop, and bus stops. Several resturants across the street from the hotel all reasonably priced and good food, or go to Union Sq 3 blocks away (10mins walk) for plenty more restaurants to choose from. Italian on the corner of Ellis St is very nice. You cannot go wrong with this location!Transfer from the airport on BART is $5.30 one way, and takes around 30minutes. Very convenient given the proximity of the hotel to the station, and much cheaper than a taxi. The streetcar stops less than a block away from the hotel, and goes all the way down to Fisherman's Wharf, Pier 39 and the Ferry Building etc. Shopping nearby is excellent- less than a block away from Bloomingdales at the San Francisco shopping centre, and 3 blocks away from Union Sq with Macy's, Tiffanys etc...	
Nov 13 2008 	Great stay at convenient well-priced hotel.	Just returned from a two-night stay at Parc 55 Hotel in Union Square, San Francisco, CA and it was wonderful. The hotel is very conveniently located: from the SFO airport, we took the BART to Powell St. station (~45 min) for $5.35 one-way and the hotel was just across the street as we exited the station. The desk staff was very friendly and efficient--it took &lt;5 minutes to get our room. Once upstairs, we were pleasantly surprised. Our room w/ king-size bed was nicely sized and everything from the carpet to the furniture looked clean, modern, and tasteful. We were on the lower floors so there was no real view but ample sunlight in mornings nevertheless. The bed was comfortable and the towels were fluffy, relatively new (old towels are a big pet peeve). An attendant even stopped by 20 minutes after we check-in to make sure everything was okay with our room. Hotel prices were as expected for 4-star hotel. Internet access was $12.95/24 hrs, room-service continental breakfast $16.95. My only (minor) concern with our stay was that the hotel's surrounding area could be pretty noisy at night (something the hotel acknowledges given the provided earplugs). It didn't really bother us but those who may have trouble should consider requesting a higher floor. Being in Union Square just off Market Street, the location was as convenient one could get in San Francisco for tourist and business-types. However, convenience can attract all types of people so definitely keep wits about you, especially at night. Overall, this hotel was a great value and experience. Would definitely stay here again.	
Nov 10 2008 	Clean and Beautiful	We stayed here for a romantic getaway and show in the city.Location can not be beat...We went to the Warfield for a show and walked the 1 block back the room after.Had a room on the corner of the 25th floor. Panoramic windows on 3 sides provided breath taking views.. Room was super clean and the bed had like 10 pillows for you to choose from. Staff was very friendly.Hotel is large enough that taxi service is never a problem. Valet parking was $50 a night but thats the price you pay for valet in the city. All and all great stay. We also used AAA membership for slight discount.	
Nov 7 2008 	Above and Beyond	Just spent a week at the Parc 55 and it was incredible! Great location convenient to many types of transportation, food in the immediate area was abundant and incredible, the service was top notch, from the valet and bell staff to housekeeping and all the behind-the-scenes folks who made it such a wonderful experience, and I must compliment Maria and Ericka at the front desk who made great customer service seem so much a part of what they do that one wonders why all establishments cannot make it work as well as the Parc 55. We absolutely look forward to our next visit!	
Nov 1 2008 	Convenient Clean and Elegant	I stayed here on October 30, 2008. I had to go to the San Francisco airport the next morning, and the hotel was conveniently located near the BART station in Union Square (ticket to the airport was $5.30 and takes about 30 minutes). The hotel was elegant, and very clean. My room, which was located on the 10th floor was luxiourious and spacious. There was a little sofa in the room, and the bedding was really nice. The bathroom was spacious, clean and stylish--with hairdryer and nice toiletries. Overall the decor of the room could be described as classic-modern. There was LG flat-screen 46&quot; TV. The one thing lacking in the room was a coffee maker and coffee/tea.	
Oct 29 2008 	Nice Place	My wife and I stayed for two nights for our 20th annivesary. Unfortunately we arrived later in the evening and were confronted with a long check-in line as a busload of Turkish doctors or something had just arrived. Half an hour later we were checked in and headed up to our 28th floor room. The room was very nice with a decent view mainly of buildings, but nice nonetheless. We had access to the Concierge lounge on the 31st floor and that was nice too. There were some small issues, like traffic noise (on the 28th floor, no less!). I knocked on our window to make sure they were glass and not plastic! The beds were a little hard for our tastes, but not too bad. The long wait at check-in when we had been traveling all day, but really not the hotel's fault. The parking fee for two nights was pricey, but convenient, and we only waited a few minutes each time we needed the car. And the concierge was pleasant enough, but could have been a bit more helpful on occasion. On the plus side the hotel was convenient to public transit, the rest of the staff was very nice, our room was clean, the TV was nice, and we appreciated the basic food offerings of the concierge lounge. Overall a pleasant experience. Would explore other options before staying here again, but wouldn't be against the idea either.	
Oct 28 2008 	Good Location and large room	Stayed her for 5 nights in one of the newly renovated rooms. Very nice large room which was well serviced and cleaned each day and had a very comfortable bed. Only drawback in the room was they seem to have lost the keys to the safes in the room so you would have to use facilities at reception for any items needing safekeeping. The hotel is very close to Union Square, cable cars and Powell street station where you can catch the Bart to the Airport for $5. We didn't eat here at all as there are so many places nearby better value. We had a lovely meal in the Daily Grill and you can get reasonable priced breakfasts in Lefty O'Dowls beside there. There is also a good bakery beside the hotel with bagels, sandwiches etc.I would stay here again but only if I was assured a renovated room.	
Oct 27 2008 	Not Four Stars - Location only saving grace	Not great. Good location is the only good point really. Prices for copies and room service are outrageous, even for San Fran. Customer service isn't horrible but could use improvement. Things were often broken or disheveled. Floor plans for rooms and lobby are not flattering. Not four stars.	
Oct 27 2008 	Don't stay at Parc55	Making our reservations more than one month out, we called to verify and found they had us arriving a day later than planned. Arriving early we understandably found our room not ready and were asked if we could come back in approximately two hours...we did and our room still wasn't ready. As a solution to the problem Parc55 gave us a similar room which was so hot that it was unbearable even with the air conditioning on. To there credit they were able to switch our room when a complaint was made. Overall I was very disappointed in this hotel. For what was paid I would expect much more than what I could receive from any roadside Motel 6. Rooms are lacking the basics. No microwave. No refrigerator. I'm not asking much, but when paying $200 dollars a night, I would expect more. Bathrooms are small. Wall paper is bubbling in areas. Outlets are old, faded, and dirty. Not what I would expect from such a &quot;luxury&quot; hotel. Next time I will stay at the Hilton across the street.The only positive is that the staff seemed to be helpful when asking questions or addressing complaints. Parc55 is also central to downtown. Unfortunately for Parc55, this experience will not find me recommending their Hotel to anyone.	
Oct 27 2008 	Excellent Location Huge Rooms	Huge Rooms with amazing panoramic views of San Francisco. Was great to look out the windows in the evenings of our corner room.Check in, no King bed available so had to change the second day. Replacement room was only Queen size bed but the room was huge and well maintained. Separate closet and dressing area that lead to large bathroom.The location could not have been better. Powell street BART station, Cable car to Fishermans Wharf and cable car down to Castro area all on your doorstep. Also only across the road from huge Westfield Shopping Centre and close to Union Square shopping and dinning.Staff were ok. Cabs easy to get outside hotel lobby. Would definitely stay at this hotel if going to San Francisco again, as long as the price wasn't too excessive.	
Oct 25 2008	Great Location for Shopping	I've stayed here before and knew it was where I wanted to stay for some quick shopping. Very convenient to Nordstroms, Macy's, Bloomingdales, and other various shopping experiences. My check in and bellstaff experience was fine. I paid a bit extra to stay in an executive room. I asked for a quiet room and it was wonderfully quiet. Climate control wasn't great but I didn't call for any help with this. Rooms are a little dated but very comfortable. Nice flat screen, nice bathroom, comfortable bed. My only complaint, is the executive lounge was substandard. I went for evening dessert and there were some cut up brownies that looked pretty Costco. Coffee, Tea, Honor Bar. Not comparable to other executive lounges. The Concierge one evening made it very clear for everyone to hear that he hated American women. I'll stay here again, but not at the executive level unless someone else is paying. Only caution, when you walk in the other direction of Market its a pretty bad neighborhood.	
Oct 24 2008	Centrally Located	When we arrived at check in we were informed that there weren't any rooms available for the booking we had made and we were asked if we would be happy to stay in a twin room. I said politely that if they didnt have the room we had booked that we should be upgraded. The receptionist excused herself for 30 seconds and came back and said that we would be upgraded to a Queen City View Room for no extra charge, and apologised for the inconvienience.When we got to the room it was large and spacious. We were on the 25th floor and had the best views. I would recommend staying higher up to avoid the noise of the traffic. The bed was extremely comfortable and the bathroom was as big as the room.We had already read the reviews about the extortionate valet parking so parked our car two blocks away at payforless for $20 a night, without any problems.The hotel is centrally located to the shops, is right near the cable car terminal and trams leave from opposite the hotel. If I went to San Francisco again I would probably stay here again.	
Oct 22 2008 	Central Location Good Standard	Could not get more central than this, well maybe Westin Hotel Union Square, but that's just being pedantic! Central location next Powell St Station was handy but there was a concentration of bums across the street form hotel which is a bit unnerving when you first emerge from train station. However the hotel is of good quality, busy hotel with a lot of air hostess &amp; pilots constantly checking in and out! Seems to the airlines hotel of choice! The homeless people you will realise are not really a particular problem any more so then other parts of San Francisco.The bed was comfortable, room well appointed. The staff seemed to be very busy but not unfriendly by any means.Would recommend this hotel if you want to be centre of the action, cable car, Bart (subway), F line Street car (tram) &amp; many buses, Union Square, major shopping areas all literally steps away.	
Oct 22 2008 	Decent stay overall	My wife and I stayed at the Parc 55 Hotel reluctantly at first. We wanted a spot near Fisherman's Wharf, however the hotel we originally booked was beginning renovations and all other hotels in that area were booked. Parc 55 and Union Square seemed the next best option. The location is great, it's less than a block to the Market/Powell cable car turnaround. All of Union Square is convient as well. However, the other side of the hotel seemed kind of sketchy. Our room was a standard king bed room on the 17th floor. The view was great as we overlooked all the skyscrapers in San Francisco. The bed was comfy, flat panel TV was a nice touch, and the bathroom was spacious and nicely appointed. The only problem I would point out is the noise. My wife and I live in a small apartment on a busy street so we are used to it, but I did notice that you can hear people in the rooms around you quite clearly. Also, despite being on the 17th floor, I could hear the traffic outside (along with the bell rining from the cable cars). Again, we are used to the noise so it was no problem for us, however I can see why some people may be bothered. The staff was more than friendly and helpful. They even allowed us to check in 3 hours early (we just drove 4 hours from Yosemite and badly needed to relax and freshen up before exploring the city). Parking is expensive, but that is to be expected in the city. Same goes for room service.	
Oct 6 2008	So-so	Parking here is overpriced, considering a fairly lengthy wait to collect the car from the valet service.Hotel Internet access is incredibly slow. Rooms are reasonable, although last stay I had a staff service corridor behind one wall, with staff banging trolleys into the wall repeatedly (enough to jolt the bed).Bell-staff are downright rude. I got asked to make sure I left the handle to the suitcase up in future (because it's so much effort for them to do, obviously). I couldn't find my luggage receipt and was in a hurry; they said &quot;There are too many bags to look&quot; and didn't intend to let me have my luggage back. I pressed the issue and they let me point to my luggage in their storage room. Not sure if they expected me to just give up and let them keep my belongings or not, but they sure gave that attitude. -10 out of 10 there.My second stay here, and the Hertz counter still never, ever had anyone working there. (Avoid booking anything to pickup/drop off at that hotel from hertz, but that's another story).	
Oct 2 2008 	Excellent stay	Had an excellent stay for 6 days on 31st executive floor. Corner room with great view from GG to Market street (sunrise and sunset). Very clean, perfect room maid. Perfect service in the executive lounge on 31st floor. HSIA included in rate, working perfectly. Large flat screen tv set. Bathroom okay but nothing extraordinary. Some noise from the windows - would need to be renewed. Only missed a fancy, young bar.	
Sep 30 2008 	Perfect location	My partner and I stayed at the Parc for 3 nights in late August. Love the location and the hotel although being remodeled at the time was in very good condition. Check in was quick and smooth. Loved the room. Very comfortable bed, great shower. The hotel is close to all the great downtown shopping and restaurants. Also there is a small bakery right outside the door for a quick breakfast. Across the street is a BART station and very close to the Cable Car line for a jaunt to fishermans wharf.My only complaint was the cost of internet in the lobby - I believe it was $5.99 for 20 minutes-I bit too steep for me! There is a sports bar and an asian restaurant on premises.Overall a great experience.	
Sep 30 2008	Central hotel in San Francisco	Excellent location in down town San Francisco, right next to Market Street and where cable cars run from. Only issue is noise of police sirens at night: kept us awake despite being on 20th floor, maybe we were unlucky.Children really liked breakfasts there, though quite pricey.Rooms have everything you'd need given you are staying in a downtown locationSimon	
Sep 27 2008	Great hotel!!!	My husband and I stayed here in early september, this is a large busy hotel, a short cable car ride away from Fisherman's wharf. We had a room on the 17th floor, we had amazing views of the city. The rooms are of a high standard, I would highly recommend this hotel if yiu are looking for a good location and high standard room.	
Sep 27 2008 	A very bad experience	This is without doubt the worst hotel we have EVER stayed in. And, i've stayed in over twenty hotels inLA and SF this year alone.So what was wrong?Firstly, they completely messed up our bookings, this was their fault, as they admitted, not ours. But the treatment we then recieved by their counterstaff was unhelpful and downright rude.At 1.30am in the morning we were still arguing for rooms, which they eventually gave us. But, without telling us, one of the rooms was on the smoking floor, which simply wasnt acceptable, even in emergency for someone who has allergies. We felt decieved and it was too late to do anything about it.There was no help in getting our luggage from the taxi to the reception and we had to stack and wheel the luggage cart ourselves. No porters were working. When they did find one to bring the cart up to our rooms, a Fed-ex package that had arrived for us to be put on the trolley taking our luggage up simply disappeared (!!)The only helpful person, who actually semed to care, in the entire hotel was the bellhop!It took until 3.30 the following day for them to sort out the rooms properly and then they failed to transfer the luggage from one room to another as promised.On requesting a delayed checkout by an hour we were informed that there would be a large charge for this - despite the previous failures of the hotel in our booking.I have one main comment - staff here just dont care. They are officious, rude and inept and everything takes at least a minimum of eight hours to process. Even simple requests.For this mess, we have recieved no apology, and for certain, will never stay here again.	
Sep 26 2008 	Awesome I would go back any time	I decided to book this hotel when I saw a really good deal for it on Expedia.ca, and I'm glad I did.I asked for a room with a view, and initially was a little disappointed that I was on the 10th floor- I had wanted higher. But the fact that my room had a balcony helped make up for that. Being able to stick my head out the balcony for fresh air was really nice.Location-wise, this hotel can't be beat. It's right near the BART terminal, Cable car turnaround, and several major bus routes. It's also a quick bus ride or reasonable walk from the ferry building, and there is A LOT of shopping nearby. The infamous tenderloin district is also nearby, but it's easily avoided, should you choose to do so. There's also lots of places to eat nearby, everything from fast food to fine dining. For a non-driver, you just can't beat the location.I found the staff to be extremely courteous, helpful, and friendly- everyone from housekeeping to concierges were wonderful to deal with. My second night there, I booked a massage, which took place right in my hotel room. I am not sure where they get their therapists from, but the lady who worked on me was great.-FYI- massage therapists come in from outside the hotel, they're not hotel staff. This hotel's main clientele seems to be conference attendees and flight crews- as a guest, you will see lots of flight attendants, pilots, and others in the lobby, sometimes at odd hours.One thing I cannot appreciate enough-Even though I looked different from this hotel's usual customer base due to my distinctive wardrobe of handmade custom clothing, I was never made to feel like a less valuable customer. Hotel staff always treated me kindly and professionally. No &quot;looking down on&quot; happening here.Something else I appreciate- the hotel is trying to do its part for the environment, so they don't automatically change the bedding and towels every single day. They've got signs in the room explaining this- if you want a fresh towel, leave the used one on the floor. If you want to re-use it, hang it on the rack. Want a change of bedding? Place the provided sign card on your bed when you go out for the day, and they'll change the sheets for you.I would most definately go back to this hotel for a future visit, or recommend it to family and friends. Thanks in no small part to a wonderful hotel staff, my stay in San Francisco was truly awesome.	
Sep 25 2008 	Great Stay Great Location!!!	Bit of delayed response, but finally have some time on my hands. My fiancee and I stayed here for 3 nights over Valentine's Day weekend and had a great time! We got the room at a bargain rate ($100 per nite) off of priceline! If you don't know about booking through priceline, you need to learn about it. I do it whenever I can now!!! One of the best things about this hotel is the location! It is literally right above the BART station and across the street from the F Street Car stop! We took the BART from SFO and didn't need a car our whole trip. Checking in was a breeze. For those that have booked through PL, you know you need to sweet talk the counter person to get a good room. After making some small talk, we ended up with a high level room w/ 1 king bed and a GREAT VIEW!!! The bed was very comfortable and the room was a very good size! I would also like to mention that the sports bar they have there has really great munchies! Get the wings and calamari! Like I said before, the location is fantastic! Walk 3 blocks up, you are in Union Square. Cross the street to the F Car or the Cable Car and you can anywhere you want! Would definetly return, even if I have to pay a little more!	
Sep 8 2008 	Nice hotel - but took a little griping to get things right	We booked our 2 queen bed room on Expedia for a family of four. When we arrived after midnight for a guaranteed late arrival, we were told our room was not ready, but that we could go to the hotel across the street for the night and come back the next night. We declined and (nicely) asked for the room we had already paid for. They offered us a king bed and a cot. We declined and (nicely) asked for the room we had already paid for. Eventually they agreed to offset the cost of our stay for our troubles and quickly made up a 2 queen bed room for us. It was quite comfortable - and ended up just fine in the end.	
Sep 5 2008 	nice location large rooms but thats it because VERY NOISY	First of all I realize it is difficult to find a good hotel in San Francisco for a good price. I paid around USD 200,- (taxes included) for this one and as the hotel is not that new, the room internet and parking could be much less expensive) Stayed here for 6 nightsPositive:- good location (next to the shopping area, union square, market street, trams, cable car)- pleasant and nice people at reception and at the reservation desk when calling- a lot of elevators (so you never wait too long to get one)- a bit expensive as the hotel is quite old- Burger King just across the road (convenient when travelling with kids)- good bed lining- lat flat screens (in new rooms)Negative:- very very noisy (even when on 17th floor and above), you can hear the police and ambulance sirens as if you were sitting in it (I than understood why there were free Quies ear plugs in the bathroom :-) : because of the bad thin windows - very big hotel (more than 1000 rooms), therefore always very busy and crowded. I know some people do not like it- bathroom not cleaned very well (a lot of hair found everywhere etc )- no safe in the rooms. The hotel offers a safe room (like in banks) but the problem is that you better be very well organised as you have to queue each time at the reception between the people check-in in/out to have access to the room- valet parking is not very well organised and very expensive (above USD 45)I would not specially come back to this hotel or recommend it to friends but again hotels are very expensive in S.F. Also be aware, that not all the rooms are renovated !!!	
Sep 4 2008 	Good location nice rooms helpful staff.	My wife and I booked this hotel for a night out in San Francisco. We booked two rooms: One for ourselves, and one for our sitter, who was watching our young kids while we were out to dinner.LOCATIONIt's centrally located, close to Union Square. It's easy to get to. It's not the greatest neighborhood, but it's not all that bad, either, unless you're accustomed to living in one of those places where you never lock your doors and everyone, um, looks the same. I wouldn't hesitate to stay in the area again.ROOMSOur room was nice. It was adequately sized (a little small with two beds, but not cramped). Our sitter scored the excellent room: When we checked in and mentioned that she would have our kids for quite a few hours in the evening, they upgraded her to a deluxe room that was huge. She had plenty of room to entertain the kids without going completely bonkers.The beds were very comfortable, the bathrooms were nicely appointed, and in general the decor was pleasing. There was no minibar/fridge in the room, which was disappointing, but not a big deal since we were staying just one night. The room was quiet, which is always a plus.AMENITIESThe hotel lobby itself is fairly small, but there's a lobby bar upstairs that looks nice. (We didn't have time to linger there, unfortunately.) Other common areas were clean and well-kept.The workout room was rather large by hotel standards, and in good condition; I managed to get a decent workout in. We ordered room service for the kids and sitter; the food was good and service was prompt. Mind you, we were ordering for kids, so I don't know how good some of the more complicated items are.In general, the hotel had everything we needed for a one-night stay.STAFFStaff was very good - as good as or better than that of other SF hotels we've stayed at. The treated us and the kids very well. Reception/front desk staff was particularly helpful. Bags were deliverd and picked up promptly, and we didn't have to wait long when our car was brought around.Since we'd already made all of our plans before arriving, we didn't use concierge services, so I can't comment on that.MISCELLANEOUSParking was outrageous, but you expect that in San Francisco. Still -- ouch.SUMMARYWe liked it, and would stay there again. We paid a significantly reduced rate through Priceline, and it was an excellent value. We had no problems, the staff was helpful, the upgraded room was a nice surprise, and although nothing stands out as particularly excellent, it's a nice place to stay.	
Sep 3 2008 	Fairly Decent Stay	I took my wife to SF for our third anniversary becuase she always said she wanted to go there. Having been only a few times and not really knowing the lay of the land, we chose to stay at this hotel based on reading other reviews and realizing that this area was ,at the very least, not one of the places to avoid.We purchased a flight and hotel package from Expedia, so I am guessing we paid about $230 a night for the room. As I understand it, that is a decent bargain for SF hotels. On the basis of that price, I would recommend this hotel. However, I wouldn't ecpect it to be anything special.In the past, i have stayed at the W and thought that was a great hotel. This isn't the W. But for the price, it isn't a bad stay.The Hotel is large. The lobby isn't grand, but who really cares. The employees aren't the friendliest, nor are they particularly helpful. However, I found that to be the case for most San Franciscans anyway. Even the people who live here will tell you that the people are &quot;cold&quot; and &quot;rude&quot;. I would agree, but having parents from New York, it didn't faze me.The room is a basic typical hotel room. No fancy furnishings. No extra special amenities. One thing I found lacking was a safe, which would have been nice to have. Another thing it lacked was an interface on the TV for checking your bill or checking out. I found that odd. Finally, it had an internet connection, but you need to have your own laptop to get it it and that was inconvenient. Normally, I am not much for using the internet on vacations, but I found that having it in a place like SF is necessary for making reservations at restaurants and pulling up directions to things before you head out. Needless to say, they charge you $13/hr for it anyway, which is rediculuous. They should provide that for free. The bed was a bit uncomfortable, as it is a cheapie and is very bouncy. Everytime my wife woke up to go to the bathroom, I woke up and vice versa. They also don't provide very nice blankets - typical foamy blanket. I will say that I was SHOCKINGLY SURPRISED that the sheet was a FITTED sheet, and not a flat sheet that comes off the bed at night. That was the first time I have EVER seen that. All hotels need to do that.I would suggest that if you do stay here, you get a floor up high like we did. It was very quiet for a noisy city.The location was fairly good. It is right across the street from the BART, the cable car turnaround [which goes up Powell], and the F line [which goes to Embarcadero and Fisherman's Wharf]. After touring around most of the SF downtown,I can say that this area is probably the better area to stay in. Fisherman's Wharf is definately not the place to be [tourist trap], and other areas don't seem to be in places near stuff. This place is near a lot of things, or is near the transportation that gets you to everywhere.Overall, I would recommmend staying here for this price. If you pay more, then maybe try elsewhere.	
Sep 1 2008 	Great Central Location	I picked this hotel because I got a good deal on one of the travel websites. I wanted to explore the city outside of Union Square but I stayed here due to their easy access to public transit- the BART station is about 50 steps from the front door of the hotel.I also chose this hotel because it was one of the few in SF that didn't charge you to use the gym ($10 to $15 a day to use a gym for a few days adds up!). The gym had new equipment, lots of cardio machines, and was clean. Each cardio machine had its own TV- better than the view outside the window, which is a view of the side of an old building. Overall, the stay was above average. I was on the 10th floor- I wish I had asked for a higher level or a courtyard room as SF is a very noisy city- I think sirens in this city go off 24 hours a day and are 10 times louder than normal sirens! Luckily, I brought my own earplugs but the hotel provides you a pair in your room. Don't stay on the 5th floor- that is where the gym was and so there was alot of foot traffic there!I had booked a room with a king bed but they only had a room with two doubles available- luckily I am short because they are small beds! I did not have a fridge in the room, so the only way to have cold bottled water was to buy one for $2.75 from a machine on a different floor! There was one drawer for your clothes, so be prepared to leave all of your clothes in your suitecase. If you like to unpack your things like me, you may have a hard time with that. I thought this was odd, as the TV stand could easily have been both a TV stand and a bureau with drawers as other hotels have. The hotel itself was clean and housekeeping was quick to respond to my requests when I needed their assistance a couple of times. If you can overlook the no fridge, small beds, and no drawers, the location can't be beat!	
Sep 1 2008 	Okay but a bit expensive	We stayed one night over the labor day long weekend.The hotel was fine. They let us check in early (11am), but couldn't give us a late check out. The room was clean and most of the hotel interior is new. The decor is pretty tacky.All the staff were friendly and the work out room is pretty well equipped and not a bad size.I think overall it was a bit overpriced for what it is (and the fact that there isn't a pool). Location is central, but getting a bit close to the bad area.	
Sep 1 2008 	Good location - tytpical city hotel	We spent three nights at the Parc 55. Very impersonal as most city hotels are but there was just something about it that did not endear you to this hotel. It was fine for what we needed - excellent location. Took the BART from the airport and it is nearly on the doorstep. Great location for all transport and seeing the sights. Room was fine however a little pokey for family of four and the double beds were very small. It was noisey and the people in the room next to us had the TV blaring until 4 a.m. - just what you need when you have completed a long haul flight and have been up for nearly 24 hours! There was no help getting through the door from the bell staff even thought we each had a case and rucksack - they just watched us. We picked up our hire car (dollar just round the corner from the hotel) when we were leaving San Francisco but heard that the parking was extremely expensive and a bit of a nightmare.	
Aug 30 2008 	Bargain Deal !	We were a party of 3 adults, in a two double bed room. Price was great 212$ per night including tax. (relative to other hotels from same class). Room was nice, with all the amnities you need. The hotel is located an walking distance from Union Sq, adn othe SOMA attractions!	
Aug 28 2008 	Nice Hotel - Central Location	We stayed in the Parc 55 hotel for 4 nights during mid July; on arrival we were talked into upgrading to a Club Room which included breakfast in the club lounge. Our room was on the 25th floor with views over the city Overall the upgrade was well worth the money.The hotel is very well positioned being close to the BART, cable cars and local transprort. Its very close to major shopping areas - our teenage daughters particularly liked Forever 21 clothing store situated 200metres away. There were a number of vagrants in the area, and indeed in San Francisco, but generally they were harmless and usually polite.We found the hotel of a high standard with pleasant staff and would not hesitate to go back there.	
Aug 27 2008 	The worst hotel during our trip	We chose to stay in a downtown hotel in San Francisco and made a &quot;good deal&quot; with $199 plus tax at the Parc 55. Had we known the hotel before, we would have spent more money for one of the better hotels around the corner. We arrive and see that they charge over $50 per night (incl. tax) for parking - even the public parking around the corner charges only $34 (incl. tax). C/I, after waiting in line for around 15 mins(!) at around 1.45 pm, we we're told by the agent that we would have to wait 2 hours until our room gets ready (C/I time: 3 p.m.). Besides that (which can be understandable in some cases), the lady was unfriendly, if not to say rude - no welcome, no thank you for staying here - nothing. You rather feel like you are an unwelcome work load. The concierge gave a map to explore the city in the waiting time, however we first saw our luggage standing completely unattended in the lobby - the bellboys we apparently more interested in rating the women in the lobby than checking on luggage. We asked them to store our valuables in the meantime, the only comment we got was: $40 dollars if you lose the key. Both of us working as hoteliers - we were amazed how this hotel survives, given they treat all customers the same. The room was standard, but nice and clean on the 28th floor with a nice view of the city, the only staff that can be honoured is housekeeping which have been very efficient; rooms were neat and tidy. We didn't even dare to try out any of the F&amp;B offers they have. If you don't give anything for service, choose the Parc 55 - otherwise two words: Stay away.	
Aug 27 2008 	Very Nice Hotel	We arrived at the Parc 55 Hotel after a long drive from Los Angeles. Check in was fast and efficient and as we walked into the main lobby we were suprised at how grand it looked.The room was lovely and spacious with two large queen beds. We had our towels changes every day and the place and room spotless.The location of the hotel was great as it was only a couple of blocks away from Union Square. The cable car stop is only a few blocks away too and within walking distance.While you are staying in San Fran, you must go to Alcatraz, it was actually the best thing about San Francisco. We managed to see the whole city in two full days, but that was not done at a leisurely pace! Also, the Golden Gate bridge was spectacular and Longbard Street was cool too. Visit Pier 39 to see the sea lions and look round the shops and attractions. The only thing I didn't like about San Fran was the amount of homeless people on the street. Me and my friend wanted to go out for a bite to eat one evening and no sooner had we left the hotel and walked a couple blocks, we were harrassed by homeless people. I am usually confident in large cities like this, I have been to many places, but I have to say that in San Fran I felt very uneasy. We ended up getting a subway sandwich and eating it in the hotel room!! This was a shame as we would have loved to have sampled the food in China Town etc but as two young women, we did not feel safe at all.The hotel was lovely though and if they could pick it up and put it in another location it would be ideal. If I decided to go back to San Fran (which I don't think I ever will, but never say never) I wouldn't stay here as a loan female or small group of women. The only way I would feel safe is if I went with my partner or in a large party.	
Aug 25 2008 	Great Hotel and Location	Great Hotel very central for sightseeing. We booked a club room thinking it would be big, but it was quite small compared to other places we stayed in. Everything was great except for breakfast, which is served in the club lounge on the top floor(great view), but unless you are early it's a bit of a bun fight and the quality was not great. The canapes and desserts offered at other times of the day as part of the package were great.	
Aug 24 2008 	fast lifts	This is a smart hotel with slow checking in service. Close to Macy's for shopping. We had a room with two double beds , but the beds were very small for double beds.The hotel is used by lots of airline staff and the information desk was very helpfull for maps and sightseeing info.	
Aug 23 2008 	Delighted	Stayed here at start &amp; end of a two week trip to California. Eight nights in all. The hotel is in a great location, just outside the BART station, with a direct train to-from the airport. There is a lift from the station up to the street. The area around the station is a bit seedy with a lot of down-and-outs but no hassle experienced. It is a good spot for shopping (Westfield Centre across the street &amp; Union Square area up the street a couple of blocks). Cable car turntable is just along the street. Powell-Hyde route is best - but busiest.The hotel was spotlessly clean. The rooms were excellent. There are 30 floors, some great views over the city.I see in petthekat's review that Maria on reception gets a mention. She also sorted us out. When we came back for our second stay, one of our rooms did not appear on the register &amp; the hotel had overbooked (apparently it does this a lot). But Maria sorted it - we got 2 rooms on the 29th floor reasonably close to each other. Luckily we had arrived at 4 p.m., I don't know what would have happened if we'd arrived at 11 p.m. One gripe : the hotel charges $15 a day for WiFi. We stayed in 5 other hotels in California and none of them charged.I would definitely stay here again and would have absolutely no hesitation recommending it	
Aug 21 2008 	Basic and good location	This hotel is really well located - it's next to a BART station so it's easy to get to and from the airport without having to get a cab; it's one or two blocks from all the great shopping at Union Sq; it's around the corner from the cable car; it's walking distance to some good bars/restaurants. Getting to Pier 39 was no problem as it's just a short cab ride away. China Town is also walking distance - about 10 minutes or so as long as you don't mind walking up steep roads! It is best to get a cab to go to Golden Gate Bridge - and get their number so you can call for a cab back as it can be difficult to flag down a cab here!The rooms are well equipped with the basics. We booked a standard room which was compact but prefectly fine. Rooms are clean. The bed is big and really comfortable. The bathroom could do with an update as they are really old. It's not a fancy hotel, so if that's what you're looking for don't stay here. However, the hotel does have lots of pluses, location being one of them and which is why we chose to stay here.	
Aug 19 2008 	A good choice in San Francisco	Stayed with my wife and daughter for 2 nights on our first trip to the USA and it was a good decision. The only downside was that after booking a club room I was told on arrival that the club rooms were being refurbished and we were given a standard room on the 26th floor. We weren't given the correct club key cards and had to exchange them on day 2 at reception to get access to the club lounge where we had an excellent breakfast on our last day.Fantastic views from the club lounge.The hotel is very convenient for all the attractions such as cable car,shopping,restaurants etc - Why does anybody stay at Fisherman's Wharf?(Blackpool with an American accent!!) as the center of the city is much more varied.Had a light meal in the bar/dinner called Barley and Hops and it was fine with friendly staff.The other night we had a chinese meal across the road from the hotel which was fine.The weather was cold,foggy and damp - as Mark Twain said 'The coldest winter I ever spent was a summer in San Francisco!'	
Aug 15 2008	great rate service and location	I booked this hotel for a trip with my aunt. She is notoriously picky, so i was concerned about negative reviews, but the location seemed ideal. Everything was great. My desk clerk, Maria, went out of her way to accommodate me. I had special requests and she worked diligently to accommodate them.We were given a corner room with fantastic views. It was clean and recently updated, with great bed linens. My main concern was other travelers comments about the noise level. If you live in a city, noise is common. It's part of city living. I felt this hotel was quieter than my home, but i live in the city. If you are a suburb kind of person, noise will be an issue in any city. There are adjustable vents at the bottom of the windows that are loud if left open. Otherwise, my stay was quiet.The bellmen are great. They will get you a limo to the airport for the same price as a cab.Overall, i would not resitate to stay here again.	
Aug 9 2008 	Just ok Front Desk needs retraining	Requested a high corner room in February through the hotel website for my August trip to San Francisco. Front desk was unaccomodating upon check in. Checked with them every day of my six night stay and they were not able to honor my request. Staff with few exceptions seems cold and unapologetic. Location A+ (get the muti-day Muni pass)Staff D- Customer service training neededRoom C- Clean but Average, AC did not work properly in room, bed ok but not wonderful, three oversized pillows uselessExtras C - Business center will let your print a boarding pass for your return trip for free, anything else costs per page with internet access $10.00 for 20 minutesOverall C- Location is the key with this property. Service is lacking and upgrades bring them to about the year 2000. Not impressed and will stay elsewhere next time.	
Aug 6 2008 	Always a nice stay	I've stayed at the Parc 55 several times since 1996 and is continually a great place to stay at a very reasonable price. The location is also fantastic. It's right off of Market, near Union Square and very close to public transportation - Muni, trolley turnaround and BART. The rooms are modern and comfortable. Stay in a room on the higher floors for great views and request to stay away from the elevators if you want a quieter room.	
Aug 3 2008 	Shockingly A good experience	My husband and I were a little nervous about staying at Parc 55 b/c the rates were so low. (we paid only $120/night) All the reviews on trip advisor seemed fine, and by the pictures it looked to be a nice hotel. They were right! The hotel was recently renovated, and so all the furnishings were up to date and very nice. It seems like it was an old Hilton or Hyatt that was bought and updated. It's not the 'boutiquey' hotel you typical see in San Fran, but it was a very nice and clean place to retire at night. We would highly recommend it!	
Aug 3 2008	enjoyed my stay at the Parc 55	Visited San Francisco for the first time and based on the price, location and overall good reviews on Trip Advisordecided to stay at the Parc 55. Overall grade C ..... Paid a little more and got a corner room on the club level. Nice to be up that high and get a good view, but save the cash and get a View room. I got access to the Club Lounge ( really NOT WORTH IT). I went there in the morning for coffee and muffins, but that was it. When everyone comments on the great location, BELIEVE IT:if you take the BART from SFO, the powell st stop is a 1/2 a block from the hotel. this is right next to the Powell St. Cable car Turrn Around. And YEs.... the Westfield Shopping mall is just a block away. MY opinion only ......DO not waste your money eating at the restarants( the barley &amp; hops especially)they are very overpriced and the food isn't all that great.As far as the &quot; Remodeling &quot; goes...... gee if this is what it looks like now, what did it look like before. Yea , its nice, but nothing lavish. Now I understand why all the reviews focus just on the location aspect of the hotel, overall its a very nice hotel to stay at, but for accessability and location to everything, it can't be beat. P.S. I stongly suggest taking the San Francisco Comprehensive Shuttle Tour. you get a great tour guide and an idea of where everything is located so that if you want to go on your own you have an idea of where it is and what you'll see.	
Aug 2 2008 	Plain Vanilla Overated	The room itself was OK, but here are the downsides: typical deceptive pricing: get them in the door with a cheap quote, and then charge extra once you got them: Internet (per computer) $5 Aquafina water, $50 per night parking (the attendant lied at check-in about neighboring options. Unfriendly service at check-in and concierge desk. Just completely uninspired. OK value, if you expect 3 star hotel in good location.	
Jul 26 2008 	Better Options Nearby	Stayed here recently for a couple nights in mid-July 08 based upon the highly positive TripAdvisor feedback.OVERALLThe Parc 55 is ok. It's not terrible and it does the basics fine. However, if you're expecting a &quot;nice&quot; hotel I recommend you look elsewhere. In particular, checkout the Intercontinental San Francisco which is only a couple blocks away offering similar pricing but a much nicer and new building, decor and rooms.THE GOODVery central location. Express checkout.THE BADThe broadband in this hotel was shockingly slow. Remember 128k ISDN speeds? That's what I was getting in this hotel. Totally unacceptable for a business traveler.The hotel is just plain dumpy. Decor in the lobby, halls and rooms is ok but not nice.Overall, it's an ok value but I do believe better options are nearby for similar pricing. I'm unlikely to return.	
Jul 25 2008 	Nice Renovations!	We stayed here a couple of years ago as well and I must say the renovations were very good. The rooms and lobby look great. Bed, pillows and bathroom were excellent. I didn't seem the upgraded flat screen TV had high-def though. The price compared to comparable hotels was as low as I found. I had a little trouble with the hotel reservations that told me that they &quot;were not interfaced&quot; with the online reservations and it was a hassle each time I found a lower price and wanted it matched. In the end it was straightened out. Be sure to check the price on various websites even after you've booked to see if they drop as ours did on two occasions. Great location. San Fran really has a homeless problem with panhandling out of control. Be aware you will get a lot of that near this hotel.	
Jul 25 2008 	great two years in a row	I would like to give the Parc 55 credit for being a nice place to stay in SF. The higher floor view rooms are wonderful. This is one of the nicest bed and linens in a hotel that I have found so far.I would suggest that you try to get breakfast outside of the hotel, it is too pricey for what you get.Also, one needs to be careful in the area. The hotel is very close to some unsavory activities. The staff can and will help you with that though.	
Jul 17 2008	Great place worth every penny	Got a great deal on priceline for 109 a night. The location can't be beat. The outside of the hotel is a little ugly (who cares?) but the inside is great. I will attach pictures. Rooms are quiet, nice flat screen TV's. GREAT views. Ask for higher floors. I plan to stay here whenever we visit SF.	
Jul 16 2008 	Best Location in San Fran	I have stayed in a few hotels in San Fran, and this by far was the best. Great location, right in Union Square and heaps of shopping and restaurants close by. Tram stop just across the road. Only 30min from airport, $17 by shuttle. Pay for the upgrade: I paid a little extra ($20 or so a night) and got the Large King suite, with access to breakfast, desserts and more. Well worth the extra. This suite was HUGE.Would highly recommend this property.There are the odd homeless person around neighbouring buildings, but where isn't there in San Fran. Unlike other areas I have stayed, I felt safe here.	
Jul 14 2008 	Pretty good but for goodness sake take care of the little repairs!	The Good! Location location...100yds from from the Powell St, trolley station. Service service service...Delivered wine glasses to the room in minutes...Pillows pillows pillows! By far, the nicest collection of pillows that I have ever stuffed under my head and between my legs!!!The Bad! An electrical outlet didn't work. An electrical outlet cover was broken. The shower pipe coming out from the wall left repaired with a white silicone caulk, obviously not finished.Overall, a nice place to stay, but in the price range of $300+/per night, there is a lot to choose from in &quot;The City.&quot; Will try another place next year for the money.	
Jul 13 2008 	Above Average--Good location but nothing fancy	I stayed at the Parc 55 for a work conference. The conference facilities were above average and the banquet food was excellent. The hotel is good and worthy of a visit even though there are undoubtedly finer hotels in this beautiful city. The location is convenient to excellent shopping, across the street in the Westfield Mall, and transportation, in a light rail line, the BART, and the famed cable cars. Numerous museums, including the excellent new Contemporary Jewish Museum, are less than a 10 minute walk away. The hotel's sports bar was needed to view games not available in the room and it was very nice with a friendly staff. The room is nice, but not overly fancy or well appointed. Oddly, there is no dresser. There is a flat screen TV but no HD channels were in the lineup and the reception was very poor. Internet access is an absurd $12.95 a day and was very, very slow (a call to the help desk was worthless). The lobby is nice and the fitness center very well equipped. If you need the concierge, double check the advice: my wife asked for directions and received bad advice.	
Jul 9 2008 	Great hotel in a great location	Paid 115$ for each night thru a special on their website and for that money we got every penny out of it. Nice comfortable beds..great shower quite rooms and a great location. Check in was quick and they gave us a corner room on the 16th floor so we had a 2 window veiw of the city and only 1 neighbor! Like any facny hotel you pay for everything from 40$/night parking to 4.50 for bottled water. We parked at a lot down the street 2 blocks for 20 bucks instead. I helped a couple who spoke only Italian with their mixed up reservations and the front desk gave us free breakfast which was REALLY REALLY nice. The breakfast buffet was fantastic and I would recommend it but I have no idea what it costs....free to us :) Would absolutly stay here again.	
Jul 6 2008 	Totally disappointed	My friends and I were beginning a trip from LA to Seattle with San Francisco being the 2nd night. We chose the Parc 55 through Priceline and were excited to get a pretty good deal with naming our own price. We normally stay in 2 or 3 star hotels, and were excited to try a beautiful 4 star hotel! After our flight was delayed, we arrived at the hotel late and checked in, only to walk in to a room that was already occupied, with the occupants in bed! After returning to the front desk, we got a new room but no sincere apology for the mistake and were disappointed once we were settled in. The rooms with two beds are very cramped, the windows were broken and we had to keep the shades drawn the next day because of window washing. The bathrooms have horrible lighting and almost no ventilation. I believe the fee for internet access was around $15, and although they did offer two large bottles of lukewarm Aquafina in the room for $4.50 each, there was no mini-bar or refridgerator. The beds were comfortable, but it was a little gross to find long blond hairs on the bedspread in the morning, considering that everyone in our party is a brunette. Also the fee for parking with tax is $50/night which we thought was pretty steep. All in all, we were disappointed with our stay. The location is OK, but definitely not the reason to stay at this hotel...... as far as the rest of the trip, we stayed at Ramadas and other common hotels where the rooms were clean and spacious, with amenities like free internet, parking and fridges. We ended our stay at the Westin in Seattle for two nights, and I highly recommend it. Try the Westin in San Francisco.....you'll be happy you did!	
Jul 1 2008 	Above average good for the price	My review is somewhat late, my girlfriend and I stayed there last Thanksgiving 2007. But I've been meaning to write since then. You get what you pay for, but Parc 55 offered a really good rate which was well worth it...you'd pay the same price staying in a 3 star and I'd say the hotel was well above a 3 star and a little below a 4 star. I'm only saying that because the furniture and decor were a little dated and somewhat worn but it added to ambience and the hotel and room was very comfortable. The hotel is centrally located and walking around the hotel I thought it was in a central location and felt safe to walk the city. With that being said, I would stay here again.	
Jun 30 2008 	Great location spacious room	Very convenient location in the city; catch the cable car less than half a block away. Our room had recently been remodeled. Very spacious. Great bedding. Bath nicely done. Only complaint was that noise (just normal conversation on a phone) carried too well from the room next door, via the connecting door (which we weren't using, of course). Fortunately, our neighbor went to bed at the same time we did, so no sleep was missed. Struck me as odd, though, that among the amenities provided in the room (nice soaps, coffee, etc.), there were earplugs! Fortunately, we didn't have to use them!Would book again!	
Jun 24 2008 	Great Location	We found out that this is the Crew Hotel for a number of airlines and in my eyes, that is a good recommendation for somewhere to stay.The location of Parc 55 is excellent - right on the edge of Union Square and a stone's throw from the start of the cable car.A big and bustling hotel but it delivers everything that it says on the tin.Would happily recommend as a good place to stay in San Francisco.	
Jun 23 2008 	Perfect location great hotel!!!	This is the perfect location for seeing all of San Francisco. We had never been and the concierge was extremely helpful. We could walk or take a trolley almost anywhere. Pricelined for $115, it was worth $250. Parking was expensive ($45 per day).	
Jun 23 2008 	Wonderful Stay	I booked this hotel for one day to go into the city for my birthday. When we got to the hotel we booked a view room, but when the reception found out it was my birthday, they upgraded me to the club rooms which was nice. The club room comes with access to the club lounge which you can get appetizers, desert, and breakfast. The overall hotel was nice, our room was on the 29th floor and we had an amazing view of the city. If you are going to stay here (which i recommend) then I suggest you book the Club rooms because they are much nicer. When you walk into the hallways of the other floors (not club) the walls are very plain and boring. But when you get into the club rooms. you have nice wood pannels. Overall this hotel was very nice and a wonderful birthday stay!	
Jun 23 2008 	Perfect Family Stay in SF	We had a perfect stay here on our family vacation to SF. The hotel is in a great location--next to the cable car turnaround (buy the 3-day pass) and a block off Union Square with shopping my teenage girls only dream about. The concierge was particularly helpful, giving us great restaurant recommendations (not the same old tourist traps) and getting us preferred seating at a very popular rooftop restaurant overlooking Union Square (which made for a perfect last night in SF). The rooms were clean, roomy and best of all had a great view of SF. We stayed on the club level which is a great value as it included a lovely breakfast (Starbucks coffee), snacks and dessert, and just that added space so all four of didn't have to be in the room at the same time. The Hertz desk arranged to have our car brought from another location to the hotel so we could begin our drive down the coast. I'm an experienced traveler (Million Miles on Delta) and it is not easy finding a good hotel for a family with two teenagers without buying a second room. This was a perfect hotel. Be sure and take the Alcatraz tour (book ahead) and we loved the Movie Tour that shows you clips of dozens of movies made in SF while you visit them. We saw more on that tour than on the double decker bus tour. Pick up at Union Square convenient.	
Jun 22 2008 	Loved my stay!!	I stayed at the Parc 55 for 5 nights in September. Upon arriving into San Francisco (for the first time), I caught the Bart Train (Bay Area Rapid Transport) into Powell Street. I got off the train - walked upstairs and out the doors - There was the PARC 55. A 2 second walk across the street and I had reached my accommodation. This was very convenient for me as I was traveling alone at that stage and was a little worried about being in such a big city (well, bigger than Auckland that is!!). I need not worry at all. It was in good proximity to Union Square and also the Powell Street Tram (turnaround just over the road) as well as local restaurants &amp; bars. Good shopping in the area too! I ended up walking down to Fishermans Wharf (took around 45 mins and a few steep hills) but was really nice! From here we rented bikes and biked over the Golden Gate Bridge !!! That was fun. I recommend this property to all of my clients for convenience reasons. It was well furnished (Modern) with a bit of a few of the bay!! Was a tad on the expensive side at the time we went as it was peak time due to a conference in the area but I liked it and would definately stay here again!! I did not thing my room was run down in anyway and wasn't concerned at being on a higher/lower floor at all!!! Loved it!!	
Jun 19 2008 	Excellent	I stayed there with my friends one night after having stayed at other 4-star hotels in the area on previous nights for a conference. What a difference!! Everything seemed new/or newly renovated. The decor was simple and modern. The carpet was very cush. I don't understand some reviews complaining about water spilling on the floor blaming on the shower curtain lining as we did not have this problem (and there were 3 girls sharing the room!). Yes, there is a $14 a day for internet if you choose to use it, but that was the case in every other hotels that I stayed at. The best thing was the well-equipped gym free of charge! They even had fresh fruit. The treadmill and the elliptical machines were new and gym-quality.I would definitely stay at Parc 55 again.	
Jun 18 2008	Yuck	Disappointed in my experience here - a hotel trying to compete with luxury chains that just doesn't get it.-- Booked a room with a view on a high floor. Got a room on a low floor. They didn't bother to refund the difference ($40/night) until I asked.-- Booked a non-smoking room and it stinks of smoke.-- Service is mediocre -- nobody answers at the front desk. Though some individuals try to be helpful.Overall I would not recommend.	
Jun 17 2008 	Excellent Hotel	Good location in downtown San Francisco. We booked by Expedia and the price was significantly cheaper than the one in the hotel website. The room was big and clean and had a great view. The valet parking is extremely expensive ($50/day).	
Jun 14 2008	Great buy for Location 	Wonderful location to enjoy the vibe of Market St and Union Square shopping. Steps away from Powell St Bart station and bus/street car stop. Friendly/efficient front desk staff, bell staff, room service staff and housekeeping staff. Comfortable rooms with fresh air access. First rate bed linens and comfy beds. Rooms under going some updating, otherwise, existing rooms/baths still very serviceable. Been staying here regularily for a number of years and never disappointed. Book directly with the property via their website or over the phone for best rate and don't hesitate to ask them to match other major travel website rates if those are cheaper.	
Jun 11 2008 	Great Location	I recently was in San Francisco for a couple days after some business in Palo Alto. I booked Parc55 based on trip advisor reviews. It is a great hotel just off Union Sq. It is a large hotel, with marble etc in the entrance. ITs a really busy hotel too and a lot of airline staff seem to stay there. I requested a room high up and got one on the 28th floor. It had a pretty decent view. The room itself was spacious, a king size bed which was comfy, and a decent sized bathroom. The only negative about the room was there seemed to be some A/C vent or something outside which made fair bit of noise, but they supplied ear plugs so I slept like a baby.Its about 1 min to the Powell mason street car, and BART/subway, 5 mins to Union Sq, all the major shops are nearby. I payed $145 a night and I think I got a great deal. Would definitely stay again	
Jun 11 2008 	Nice Room Nice Location but a Bit Noisy	I was in SF for a 5-day conference and was booked in the PARC 55 by our travel department. The front desk staff was very friendly and booked me in a nice corner room with a great view of the city. The room and bathroom were a good size and very clean. The hotel is in a great location - 30 yards from the trolley and right across the street from a huge mall. The walk to China Town and the Moscone conference center were not bad either. If we needed to go somewhere further (Fisherman's Warf, etc.), the bell staff was able to hail a taxi within 2 minutes. The bar/lounge area on the 2nd floor was very relaxing and the wait staff was attentive. The only negative I could find (at no fault to the PARC 55) was there is ongoing construction at the building next to the hotel that starts EARLY (6 AM PST) and can get pretty loud. I'm pretty sure the hotel is aware of this issue as they have placed earplugs in everyone's room. Otherwise, the stay was pleasant and I would definitely stay there again.	
Jun 10 2008 	Fantastic Hotel	Stayed at the Parc 55 for five nights this month, at the end of two weeks in California and Nevada. First impressions on walking in: amazing! A huge lobby, bustling with people and activity. Had to queue to check in, but it only took about ten minutes. Check in desk was fully staffed and everybody was polite and helpful.Room was fantastic! Paid for standard room on Expedia, and we got a corner room on the 7th floor, huge room with a massive bed and enormous bathroom. 32&quot; flatscreen TV and coffee making facilities (which seem to be rare in the US) topped it all off perfectly.Tried out room service on the first night, and it was seamless. Was referred to by name on the phone, they knew exactly who I was and which room I was in without asking, taking away a lot of the awkwardness associated with room service. Food arrived in 15 minutes and was very good indeed.Tried out the hotel bar, which is a fabulous setting. Great service and ambience, although I think the same piano music every night might get to the people who work there eventually.Only blip came on check out, was billed for $350 when I had paid for the room outright on expedia. The woman at the check in desk I spoke to about the bill was quite curt, didn't offer any apology for the huge and erroneous bill, and merely handed me a new bill for the room service and drinks. This is a momentary blip though, as the service in general was first class. Concierge was helpful, bell service worked perfectly, and I was completely satisfied with the hotel in general.Highly recommended, especially at the great prices expedia are offering!	
Jun 5 2008 	Parc 55 is a great hotel	I was pleasantly surprised, the rooms were big, the service was great. Everyone was very eager to please. We had a room on the 29th floor with a great view, the morning breakfast was great for a light snack to start your day. It was convenient to have Hertz right there, and the concierge was knowledgeable and gave great service. The lounge was nice for relaxing and having a drink at the end of the day, very comfortable. I would definitely stay again, we got a great Internet rate for around $125, the best bargain we've ever got traveling for a wonderful hotel.	
Jun 4 2008 	Nice Hotel Few Issues	Nice hotel, generally clean and well maintained, although somewhat dated. Excellent shopping location, although beware, the Hotel borders on what is refered to as the tenderloin district. Straying the wrong way out of the front lobby can be a scary proposition. Keep in mind though, that otherwise, it's a good location. About 25 yards from the lobby is an underground entrance to a very large nice mall. Near that entrance there is a large food court in the Mall with plenty of selections of really good reasonably priced food (not the normal mall food court food, would even suggest it for dinner if you are on a budget). Cable car is one block away. The front desk checked me into a room that was already occupied - that has never happened to me before, and it should NEVER happen. Fortunately, I heard them in the room before I entered. When I was given a new room, the keys didn't work. The front desk checked me in a third time which worked. I was concerned because that third time the clerk tried to get security to meet me at my room to make sure everything was OK, but she couldn't reach them - I never did see them. Room was relatively clean, although I noticed a thick layer of dust on the bathrrom vent and behind the bedside table when looking for an electrical outlet. They have an excellent workout room, with plenty of great well maintained equipment at no extra charge. Nice view out my room.	
Jun 2 2008 	Too Much Noise	While I agree that the location for this hotel could not be better, I had major issues with noise during our recent stay (Memorial weekend). We got a good deal on the hotel's website ($127 per night for two double beds). However, upon check in, we were placed on the 5th floor, facing Cyril Magnin Street. Even with the earplugs in place that were so thoughfully provided, we could hear street noise. Fire trucks, police cars, motorbikes, and yelling reached our rooms. Then, at 2:15 a.m. on Saturday, we were awakened by a group of drunken guests making their way back to their rooms. Nice! No fault of the hotel, of course, but just added to our annoyance. On Saturday evening, we were entertained into the wee hours by a prom that was taking place in the 4th flloor ballroom. Nice of the hotel to advise us that such an event was taking place. My husband had to call the front desk and ask when the thumping rap noise might cease. I would have gladly paid more for a higher floor had I been advised of the noise issues and the party. The room was OK. Decent size, clean, nice bedding, comfortable beds, good sized bathroom with very good water pressure, very prompt maid service. No fridge, lousy coffee maker, no key for the in-room safe. I would not stay at this hotel again. I prefer the quiet and super comfortable Orchard up on Bush. You pay more, but the rooms are a delight, breakfast is included and you get a really good night's sleep. Had dinner at R&amp;G Lounge, a must in China Town (reservations advised) and also at Hyde Street Seafood Cafe, a very good place for fish. Good value, good service, on the 28 bus line and the Hyde Street cable. Walk back down the hill after dinner for exercise!	
Jun 2 2008 	Excellent Hotel and Location	This hotel is the perfect location...half block from the Cable Car turnaround, great coffee shop next door, bank across the street walking distance to Union Square and a half block from Market Street. Check in was fast, concierge was a great help and the rooms were nice and clean. No worries about parking since valet handles all that for you. Couldn't have been happier. Access to the hotel was right off the freeway and easy to find. Will definitely stay again.	
May 27 2008 	Great hotel excellent location!	The reviews are right, the location of this hotel could not be any better. You are surrounded by everything you need. It is located 1 street over from the cable car line and BART station. The is a mall one street over and the hotel is surrounded by numerous stores of all varieties, all within walking distance, if you enjoy shopping. For dining there are 2 restaurants located on the 2nd floor of the hotel or there is a Burger King and a Carl's Jr directly across the street if you prefer fast food. The hotel offers a nice 24 hour fitness center on the 5th floor. The staff is very friendly. They normally charge additional for 2 queen beds instead of 1 king but upon request at check in we were given the 2 beds at no additional charge. We did rent a car so did take advantage of the valet service. It is $44 + 14% tax a day. I believe that is an excessively high price but you have all day in and out privileges and it never took longer than a couple of minutes for them to bring our car up and they were always very friendly and courteous.The rooms are decorated nicely and the beds were really comfortable with lots of comfy pillows. Do be prepared that you are in a city and will hear city noises! There is a fire station located within a few blocks of the hotel so you will hear sirens in the night or very early morning. Ear plugs are provided with their toiletries. There also is an extremely large homeless population in San Francisco and the hotel is surrounded by them so do be prepared to be begged for change. These are things to expect at any hotel in San Francisco however are not vacation spoilers.I would definitely stay at this hotel again! For the great service and very reasonable rates I would highly recommend this hotel.	
May 22 2008 	it was perfect!	Hotel was very cheap for the location ($99 US/night and we were there on weekends too). It's right beside the San Francisco Shopping Centre. A hop away from Powell line cable car station, a block away from Union Square... what more would you want?Service is friendly. 24 hrs conciere ensured we were not hassled by the wandering homeless at night (We ran into one homeless man/woman asking for change, and the security came outside right away).Room is clean, and enough tables and chairs to put our stuff on. It's not very fancy, but I think it deserves a 4 star.Will definitely stay there again!	
May 19 2008 	Solid choice great location	We just stayed here for a conference I did at the Moscone Center. It was priced similarly to the Hilton (about $220) but this hotel was rated higher on this site. We weren't disappointed.The hotel is perfectly located for a lot of things -- easy walk to Moscone, close to shopping on Market St, BART station, streetcar, and the financial district, and also close to our favourite restaurants in the opposite direction. Check in and check out were fast and painless, with no unexpected charges. We were initially offered a room with double beds, and the desk clerk said there were no king beds, but we did get a queen which was fine. The room was on the 20th floor which would not have been our initial choice but it was very nice. The view was fine, and we had a bay window with a little loveseat. You do have to pay 12 or $13 per day for internet acess but the $45 per week is a much better deal if you're staying more than 3 days. The internet connection was tempermental, sometimes fine and sometimes slow. We initially signed in as &quot;wireless&quot;, and when that was slow or not working, we had to call IT. They told us to sign in again with a wired connection, pay twice, and he'd get the front desk to reverse the charges. True to word, there was only one charge on the final bill. By the way, the hotel does not charge for 1-800 calls.We seemed to have got one of the &quot;renovated view rooms&quot;. The furniture was new enough although the decor was a bit beige. The bathroom was small but nicely finished with tiled walls around the bath enclosure and granite counter. The bath isn't huge but my husband, who is 6'2'', found it fine. The water for the shower is high-pressure and instantly hot at any time of the day. The room size was decent (bigger than the last place we stayed in SF).Our room had a flat screen TV. Strangely, there was no minibar which we usually use for milk or soy milk for coffee, so we had to use the ice bucket to keep it cool.Initially we didn't like the location near the elevators and ice machine, but the soundproofing is so good we didn't notice noise at all.The gym was clean and very well-equipped with good-quality treadmills, ellipticals, free weights and a variety of weight machines.The hotel has a lounge with live music several nights, and there are a couple of other restaurants in the building. Room service menu was pretty standard with average prices.Our only tiny complaints were the lack of minibar/fridge in the room, and the strange little coffee maker which used up a new plastic tray every time (and the paper cups rather than real coffee cups). These certainly didn't wreck our experience. One huge benefit -- the whole hotel is non-smoking, so you won't accidentally get a stinky room.This is not a &quot;luxury&quot; hotel but offers value for money. We'd definitely return, whether for a conference or just for a fun trip.	
May 19 2008 	Good Hotel Good Location	We added 2 days to our San Francisco trip, and decided to book ourselves a nicer hotel than we usually go for. We booked the Parc55 for $115 per night. The front desk staff was so enthusiastic at checkin, and though we were expecting a lowerfloor room (we find most hotels give you the crappy rooms when you book through discount online hotel providers), we were given a 20th floor with a view of the financial district! My partner, an urban planner, was enthusiastic and we sat on the couch by the window both nights and enjoyed the view.Comfy bed with luxurious bedding, very clean rooms, friendly staff who always said hi. There were no problems with this hotel and I would reccomend it to anyone who wants a comfy room and confy hotel. Locatin was extremely convenient to BART, which was nice since we arrived at 11pm at night, and to the cable car (and its fun to watch them turn the cable car around on the tracks since you're on the end of the line!) We were surprised at the lack of decent restaurants within a two block radius, but within a five block radius choices were unlimited. On the negative side, we were a little shocked by the number of homeless people that come out at night around the two blocks of this hotel. Also, the &quot;extras&quot; that the hotel offers - concierge service, fitness centre - were lost on us, whereas the &quot;extras&quot; that we usually take full advantage of - free high-speed internet, continental breakfast - were absent. Internet would have cost us $15 a day, and the two rounds of drinks we had in the hotel bar ran us up a tab of $50. Finally, I am a &quot;bath&quot; person and I found the tub a little too narrow and shallow for my liking (though the high-powered shower was awesome).My partner and I would recomend this hotel to anyone who wants a comfy room with a great view, and is not too worried about the cost of extras.	
May 17 2008 	Excellent Hotel	We were allocated a recently decorated room on 22nd floor with panoramic views of city.Have no hesitation in recommending this hotel which is well located.	
May 10 2008 	Great location with a great corner room -- feels very business though	We paid only $133 per night for a &quot;renovated view room&quot; and were in a corner room on the 27th floor which offered really amazing views in three directions. For the price we paid, I would definitely return to this hotel even though I much prefer a more boutique, stylish feel to a hotel.Upon checking in, we found out that parking was $45 plus tax per night (more than a third of our nightly rate!) so we parked down the road at a parking garage for $20 flat per night. The lobby is fine, though very bland...reminds me of a typical business hotel. Everyone was very courteous and business like. At the front desk, I requested a corner room due to previous reviews of such rooms being larger, and the woman was very helpful in pulling a high floor for me and reserving it even though it had yet to be cleaned. Later when we were able to get our keys, we walked into the room and it felt more like a suite. Upon walking in there is a small room without furniture and a very large bay window. To the left around the corner is the large bathroom, next is the closet, and then beyond is the bedroom with a bay window at the end of the room and a very large bay window over the desk. There were views in every direction. From one window you could see the transamerica building, from another you could see the very top of the golden gate bridge, and from the other you could see the southern part of the SF bay. The room itself had been renovated nicely, though it felt very corporate. Still, the bed was very comfortable and the furnishings were fine. They advertised a plasma tv in the room, but it was a standard box tv (not that we cared much). The bathroom was spacious with good amenities by lather, and the shower had excellent water pressure. Room service was very good, quick, and reasonably priced. We ordered both dinner and breakfast on occasion and it was presented very nicely and was delicious.The location is incredibly convenient. Literally a block from both the subway (Muni and Bart) and the Powell Street cable car. The walls of the hotel also seemed to be very thick because when in our room, we felt like we were in a sanctuary, unable to hear anything or anyone else other than ourselves.If you like the chain-type hotels, you will surely love this one. But even if you like the more stylish independent boutique hotels, you may find that the value and comfort at this hotel is more than satisfactory. I would definitely return.The only downside that I could find was that the gym was being remodeled and there were only three treadmills that had been stuffed inside a very small room on the second floor. They did, however, offer a free pass to a gym a few blocks away, but neither my partner nor I wanted to hike our stuff up there and back. I didn't care about this at all, and my partner was only slightly peeved, but if you're a big workout person, you should probably know this.	
May 9 2008 	Above Average Great Location	Stayed here for 3 nights on business. I did not choose the hotel, and likely wouldn't have simply because while I love the neighborhood, the Hilton where I have points is right across the street. That being said, I was pleasantly surprised with how enjoyable my stay was.The exterior and lobby harken back a few decades and seem somewhat dated. My room had been recently renovated and was spotless with nice furnishings, including a couch and coffee table. Only problem is that with the new multimedia panel built into the dresser under the 40&quot; HDTV, there is very little in the way of drawer storage. I had to use the drawers in the two night stands - something I've never had to do before. As I'd read other reviews that indicated noise was an issue (I had absoluetly no problems during my stay), I found it interesting that the bathroom amenities included a pair of ear plugs!Staff were friendly and helpful. I found the breakfast buffet to be over-priced for what it was - even in SF - but the coffee was delicious and the service outstanding.Best part about this hotel is the location. Assuming you want to be in the Union Square area, it can't be beat for convenience to all transportation and shopping.	
May 7 2008 	Don't Stay Here!	Every single staff member we spoke with at Parc 55 were incredibly RUDE and unaccomodating. I was shocked at their behavior. In addition, the rooms were not clean, and are in need of renovation/refurbishing. I am a travel agent, so believe me when I say DO NOT stay at this hotel. You can find a much better SF hotel for the price (or less!) of a stay here, and you will avoid a very unpleasant experience.	
Apr 30 2008 	Good Location	We stayed here on the 20th and 21st April 2008. The Parc 55 is a large hotel, the room we booked was clean and tidy, maybe slightly on the small size but it was fine. We booked a Club room which are on the higher floors and have fantastic views either over looking the bay or the city. The complimentary breakfast was fine and also the afternoon refreshments in the executive lounge were a nice touch, we obviously received this as we had upgraded to a club room.The hotel is just off Union Square near to all the shops and the hotel provided a good location for our final 2 nights in San Francisco before flying home. As I understand the hotel is going to be refurbished in certain areas in September. I think this is probably a good idea as it could do with this in some places.	
Apr 28 2008 	Great Location	Read some reviews on Tripadvisor and they were spot on. My husband and me stayed there for 3 nights recently. The hotel was in a fabulous location if you want to be in the centre of things, we were in easy reach of Union Square, Macy's, shopping malls, cable car stops, train station etc. If you've never been to san Fransisco before then this is a great base. Cable car can be taken to the quieter Fishermans Wharf and trams can be caught to Piers which will allow you to shop or catch the ferry to Alcatraz! Hotel rooms were immaculate and views were superb. Would definately stay there again.	
Apr 28 2008 	Good Location Fair Price Not a 4 Star	The overall experience was fine. It was the little things about the hotel that make me feel that it was not a 4 star hotel. There was a tear in the shower curtain. The front desk people were...not the friendliest. The view and location were great. Across the street from a BART station and very close to Union Square. Lots to do in the area. Some advice for a traveler on a budget, it cost $45 plus 14% tax to park at the hotel. If you are not looking for in and out, there are two public garages, both within 2 or 3 block, that are much cheaper ($30 max incl. tax).	
Apr 22 2008 	It was just ok...	First Ill start out with the goodFor our recent trip to San Francisco, we really wanted a hotel with a good view and in a good location. This hotel had both. We paid extra to be on the club levels (27th  32nd floors) and we requested, and received, a corner room after reading advice on this forum. The room had a good view of the city, but I was hoping for more of a view of the Golden Gate Bridge and the water. The room was spacious and clean, but the hotel is majorly in need of updating before it can be considered a four star. The location was good  close to shopping and public transportation. We had a pizza and beers in the hotel sports bar one night. Our waiter was great, but the pizza was just so-so. We were hoping to watch a boxing match but the sports bar didnt have HBO! We were going to have a drink in the lobby bar but it was freezing in there &amp; it was on the 2nd floor with a view of Burger King so we decided to go down the street instead. Now the badthe service was terrible. When we arrived, we wanted to check in and drop off our luggage  then return our rental car around the block. (We had driven down to Big Sur for 2 days and then drove to Parc 55 for 2 nights.) The bell man told us that our luggage would be brought to our room in 5-10 minutes so we could park there briefly and wouldnt be charged. After getting into our room, we waited 20 minutes and our luggage still hadnt arrived. We called the bell desk and asked for it. We had to describe our luggage to them, then they brought it 5 minutes later. The person who brought it just threw it on our floor and left. After all that, we were charged $10 for the short time we were parked there. Other hotel employees that we encountered just seemed to have the attitude that they could care less about the guests or their jobs. In my opinion, everything about this hotel fell somewhere on the scale between ok and bad. I was disappointed and will stay elsewhere next time.	
Apr 19 2008 	Valet Broke my Mirror	The rooms are o.k., but there was a problem with the room price. They charged me more on one night than the other despite the fact we had negotiated a group rate. The biggest problem was the fact that the valet broke the mirror on my car. They said they would send me a claim form, but never did. My calls have not been returned, so I pretty much gave up on them ever following through with their promise.	
Apr 16 2008 	Loved the hotel but very poor service	The hotel itself if wonderful, but the level of care for thier guests was not there. I booked through hotwire and got a great deal. I called to confirm a room was available, they told me absolutley. Check in time was quoted at 3 pm. I arrived at four, and only a room with two very small beds was available. Not a problem, I told them i understood how hotwire works and i was willing to wait for a better room. They told me it would take an hour. I came back over an hour later, they gave me a key to the room, which upon entering we realized was never cleaned after the last occupant. Long story short, we left the hotel again until they rectified the situation. We finally were able to check in and get our bags into the room at 8:30, they never extended an apology, charged us for everything down to internet fees.	
Apr 5 2008 	Great Hotel Great Location	Great Hotel. Very upmarket, room was spacious, modern and very clean. We also had a great view of of the city from our room. Staff were very polite and helpful, although when we left the doorman tried to convince us to take a private car, rather than a taxi, which would have cost us $10 more.The location was very good for the commercial and shopping districts, and public transport links were on the doorstep for all other areas of San Francisco.	
Apr 2 2008 	Excellent Location but not a four star	Location is excellent off union square and next to the main shopping centres. Overall the hotel is very tired with both the rooms and the reception area in dire need of a refurb. The bedroom corridors were very depressing and musty. The size and shape of the bedrooms were good, the corner rooms were best with very good views over the city. This is not a four star hotel but with a refurb this could be so much more.	
Mar 26 2008 	Health Risk - Unsanitary Conditions	After seeing news stories about hotels not washing the drinking glasses in the rooms, I decided to mark the glass to see if it was exchanged. The next day after the room was made up the maid neatly placed the glasses on the vanity with protective tops placed over them. When I checked, sure enough the mark I had placed proved the glasses had not been washed. I notified the hotel manager and she sent &quot;security&quot; to take a report. That was the last I heard from the hotel manager, so evidently the Parc 55 is not to concerned with Health Department regulations. I guess they got mad that I complained because the next day the room was not made up at all. Finally at 5:00pm a maid knocked on the door and asked if we wanted the room cleaned. I didn't bother to complain just won't stay here again. This hotel is not a 4 star as advertised.	
Mar 26 2008 	Location Location Location	In case you couldn't guess, I think this hotel has the perfect location for visiting San Francisco. It is just off Market Street, and two blocks west of Union Square. It is also just a couple blocks north of the Yerba Buena Parking Structure which is a nice option for overnight parking. I have had some bad luck with hotels booked through Hotwire not living up to their star rating. The Parc 55 is truly a 4-Star hotel. The entire staff was friendly and very helpful. My room was well decorated, clean, and well maintained. The bed was very comfortable and the linens were excellent. The shower was also very nice and had the best water pressure of any hotel I have stayed in the last five years. I will definitely make a point of staying here anytime I visit San Francisco.	
Mar 25 2008	Parc 55 was perfect	Hotel looked like any other American hotel upon arrival, lots of mirrors, gold bannisters, marble and lots of sofa etc etc. Staff friendly and an excellent concierge called Rosa. She was very busy but happy to help all! Rooms were lovely, I have a room on the corner which was massively spacious and good city views. Would have liked a fridge in the room, but this didn't matter as there was an ice machine 20 metres down the hallway. Lovely comfy beds with big duvets and a million pillows!Location couldn't be better!!! Close to shops, restaurants and Union Square. You could walk to the Wharf in 20 mins-ish. I didn't eat in the hotel so have no opinion there, we chose nearby diners and restaurants, all of which were lovely. There's a great Italian across the road which is great after a long day sight seeing. Enjoy!	
Mar 21 2008	Nice Hotel Great Location	My husband and I stayed at the Parc55 for 4 days/3 nights. It was very easy to get to the hotel from the airport. You only have to take the BART, which is a 30 min ride and costs $5.35 per person one way. The hotel is located right across from the BART station, which was very convenient. Upon check-in, we were told that our room was not ready, and that it would take about an hour. But we were given a $25 voucher, which we could use in several of the hotel restaurants, so my husband &amp; I got a free dinner while we waited. After dinner, we went back to the lobby to check-in and we were told that our room was ready. However, once we got there, the room was still dirty so we had to go back down and notify the front desk about it. They apologized and upgraded our room to one of the club floors, which was very nice! The bed was very comfortable, we had wonderful views, and the room was quite spacious. We loved the location of the hotel-- very close to shopping, public transportation, and right by Union Square. We would definitely stay again!	
Mar 17 2008 	Lovely Union Square Hotel	We stayed at the Parc 55 in mid-March and coudn't have been more pleased. We stayed in one of the newly renovated &quot;view rooms&quot; which I'd highly recommend. The room was clean and newly decorated. The bed was comfortable and the linens and down comforter were great. The bathroom was fine - not spectacular, but with a new massaging shower head that was nice. The best part of this hotel was the LOCATION! It was fabulous - mere steps from Union Square and the origination of the Powell Street cable car lines. We'd recommend purchasing a 3 day Muni Passport that gives you unlimited cable car rides and bus fares (I think you can even ride the BART) thus negating the need for a car in San Francisco. Would stay at the Parc 55 again in a heartbeat.	
Mar 13 2008 	Wonderul Way to Stay in San Francisco	My son and I recently traveled to San Francisco for a three day trip. I booked the room on Hotwire for $99 a night, which was half of what other hotels were asking. The location and accomodations were excellent. We took the Bart from the Airport for $5.25. The quick half block walk from the Bart was a breeze, even with our luggage. The location for food, shopping and transportation to all the local areas are basically right in front of the hotel. The rooms were very comfortable with immediate service for any special requests. We stayed clear of the Tenderloin, but visited all of the other communities with ease and without any concern for our saftey...bumped into some panhandlers each evening but they were very kind and nonagressive. Highly recommend bus 69 from the Wharf to Coit Tower to watch the sunset. When departing the doorman coupled my son and I with four other guest for a limo ride to the airport at the same price as their shuttle. I would definitely look to stay at Parc66 for our next visit.	
Mar 11 2008 	Great Price Great Location	I recently stayed at Parc55 and was very happy with it. For the price that we paid, and the location, it was great! It's walking distance to all the best shopping, a quick cab ride to all the good clubs, and tons of excellent restaurants all around. I would definitely recommend Parc55.	
Mar 3 2008 	Good shopping location	Love the location of Parc 55, as it is fairly near to Union Square and Westfield is just right across the street. Powell street, which is parallel to Cyril Magnin Street where the hotel is, is also good for shopping. Stick to the main roads though, as the back roads around the hotel are a bit scary. A lot of bums around the area, hassling you for change and a sandwich. Suggest not to walk back to the hotel when it gets dark, as I have heard of stories where people get mugged just right outside the hotel, behind the big pillars. Hotel room is comfortable, although it would have been better if it comes with a safe in the room and some bedroom slippers. Overall, a good feel about the hotel though. Would recommend this to anyone.	
Feb 28 2008 	Excellent place to stay	We stayed for one night only at the Parc 55 in San Francisco. Everything was super from the time we checked in to departure. We were able to park our vehicle and check our baggage with the bellman early prior to actual check in. We requested a higher floor view room, that I had heard about, and got upgraded free of charge to the Club level on the 31st floor!!! Club level had a nice lounge with a nice happy hour food and drinks and an adequate continental breakfast the next morning. Thanks to Ana, the reservationist, for her help and pleasant personality!! The lobby was very impressive in looks. The bellmen and concierge persons were very helpful and courteous. Our room was great! Furnishings were nice, bedding very comfortable, nice marble bathroom with blow dryer, coffee maker, and terry robes. We had an awesome view of the city looking south and west. The hotel has a restaurant, bar, and fitness center. I guess the only thing that wasn't available was a pool, hot tub, or sauna. I was told they are going to be remodeling for some of those facilities soon. The location is the best...short walk- 1 block to the cable car and Bart Stop, Westfield Shopping Mall (really nice) and just about any store or type of restaurant you'd want to go to around Union Square.The price was great on Expedia, cheaper than some other websites and the hotel website. I highly recommend this hotel.	
Feb 21 2008	Wonderful experience th Parc 55 Hotel	The extra cost for the Club style rooms is a wonderful value!!! We could not have asked for a better hotel. The Parc is centrally located, right in the middle of everything. The hotel staff was a pleasure to assist, the bath products were wonderful, the linens were top notch - just like the quality we have at home. I can not wait for our next visit. We stayed here for business, but are looking forward to a vacation there!!!	
Feb 20 2008 	Nice room noisy hotel	My husband and I had a nice post-Valentines weekend at the Parc55. We got a great room rate from Hotwire.com. Our room was smallish, but comfortable. The king size bed was comfy, especially the down pillows and comforters. The bathroom had a phone in it! Good location for those who don't mind exploring the city by cable car, MUNI, BART, taxi, or on foot. We had an OK lunch in Barley &amp; Hops Bar and Grill.Downsides: we were near the elevator, so we experienced a lot of noise from the hallways. The hotel was hopping, full of airline employees. Mold on the bathroom ceiling above the shower. After depleting the in-room coffee we went in search of lobby coffee for which they wanted $3. Fortunately, a coffee place was right next door.	
Feb 20 2008 	Disappointing	Reception was clean, well kept, attractive and the staff friendly. The first room they assigned me had severe A/C noise problems, so straight back to the front desk for another room.The room was average, but with a very old, cheap and somewhat small TV and very bad TV reception. Room service took a look time and the food disappointing.The internet connection was terrible, with a speed below dialup.Not all ammenties were replenished each day.A lot of room noise, both from the adjoining rooms (mainly footfalls from above) and street noise.Not recommended.	
Feb 18 2008 	Nightmare front desk at checkin good location hefty parking fee	Booked two rooms at the Parc 55. Arrived around 2PM (check-in 3PM) Was told no rooms were available until at least 4PM. The front desk (Erika I believe) was as unfriendly as I have ever experienced in years of travel. Probably better suited for a less visible position in the hotel. I understood 3PM, but 4 or 5 would make us late for our dinner and show. Also, parking came to a whopping $61 for a 24 hour period so keep that in mind if driving in as that raises the cost of the hotel significantly. We will take BART next time as the station is about half a block away. Finally got the rooms around 5pm but not on the same floor even though booked together. This was OK except that one of the rooms turned out to be a handicap room with no tub, a modified toilet seat, doors, etc... Called the front desk and they agreed to move us. Back downstairs and another wait in line for a room. By now it is almost 6PM and we are still not checked in and definately not able to eat dinner prior to our show. Back up to our new room and we discover that a makeup bag is missing. We speculate it was left in the handicap room when we moved in and back out so quickly. The front desk has already reassigned this room and cannot, or will not, allow housekeeping and/or security to check the room without the new occupants permission. (even though the bag is unmistakable and has been described to them in detail.) The front desk indicates they do not have a lost and found, only housekeeping keeps things left in rooms. OK, we agree to try later as it is our fault the bag is missing. When we come back from a late night out we check again with an extremely helpful night manager at the front desk who tells us she will check lost and found and with security again. (Thought there was no lost and found. Hmmmm.) No luck. We go to bed and about a half hour later gun shots in the neighborhood and lots of sirens. We had just walked two blocks from Mel's Diner. Yikes! Next morning we call the other room ourselves and low and behold the bag is there and is retrieved. Much better start to day two than day one. All in all, the location is excellent and the rooms were good. However, the front desk (Erika at least) needs a lesson in customer service. The night manager and the doorman were as friendly as you will ever find.	
Feb 12 2008 	great location comfortable room	My friend and I stayed here for 3 nights and had a great stay. The room was very nice and the beds were very comfy. The city view was nice too. We were not bothered by noise as some reviews stated. The breakfast buffet was delicious and had lots of choices. All staff we met were extremely helpful and friendly. The toiletries provided were really nice. We booked Tower Tours from the Hotel and had a great tour. The guide was knowledegable and entertaining; I really learned a lot about the city. The location was terrific-----the trolley stop was just around the corner as was the Bart and lots of shopping right out the front door. A taxi to the Empress of China restaurant in Chinatown was around $7.00. The view and food was great. The restaurant was recommended by the hotel and it was a good choice. A very pleasant stay.	
Feb 11 2008 	Great Location	I was just at the hotel while attending a convention at the Moscone Center. While the convention supplied transportation from the hotel, I chose to walk the short distance. Maybe 10 minutes.The hotel was great. The location was great just off of Market street, where you could catch a bus to anywhere. The turn-around for the old streetcars is just around the corner.In some directions, there are plenty of homeless, but, almost entirely, they were very passive. We didn't get approached a single time, though we passed many people with hats, boxes, or hands extended. I think that's just what you get in the big cities.If you do stay here, I highly recommend a breakfast at Dottie's True Blue Cafe around the corner. It's an old diner, but a real gem, and the breakfast was awesome. 622 Jones Street I think.Hotel services were what you would expect in a high end hotel. While I didn't eat at any of the hotel restaurants, the hotel bars and pub were a great place to hang out with friends. Also, there is plenty of other nightlife within a couple of blocks, including a very interesting Irish pub.Highlights: Dependable lodging. Great location.	
Feb 5 2008	Great location and comfortable rooms	Comfortable bed, wonderful staff, and exceptional location. Very easy to get to from the Bay Bridge (which was important since my friends were in Oakland), and a convenient walk away from the major SF attractions. Would definitely stay here again.	
Jan 28 2008	Fabulous luxury in the heart of SF	We stayed at the Parc 55 en route Auckland - Vancouver on New Year's Eve. The hotel staff were very friendly, even though they had to get us to sign waivers saying we wouldn't have a party in our room (a problem in SF, apparently, on new year's eve). They also allowed us to check in early at 11:00 am after our flight from Auckland. The bed was extremely comfy after a long flight, and the hotel is close to everything a tourist could want.	
Jan 28 2008 	Best Stay	Spent one night at this hotel, it was my 3rd stay. It was the best experience of all my stays. I decided to book a room which had a better view this time and was given a room on the 19th floor that had a really nice view of the Civic Center area. Check-in and Check-out was fast. As I mentioned in my other reviews, the best thing about Parc Fifty Five is its location. My only minor gripe, and it is very minor, is to find out after I booked the reservation, that I could have got it $15 cheaper if I waited till later to book. Winter is slower, so hotels are willing to lower their rates if they have rooms available. Also, the sheets had holes in them, although the room was clean and comfortable.	
Jan 21 2008 	Super Hotel	I booked this hotel on the strength of the hotel website, the reviews, closeness to amenities and the link from the airport. All worked great. The check in was efficient and pleasant, the trip from airport was mega easy and inexpensive not to mention traffic free. The room was comfortable, roomy and for a main city location, great for the cable car etc for all you tourists like us. I would be pleased to recommend to fellow travellers. You can expect to pay a few pounds more in a city but at £73 quid a night, try getting this in London. This was a very pleasant stay. Bon voyage and I hope you all enjoy your stay, the food is pricy, but there are plenty of eating places around.	
Jan 20 2008 	great location	great location right next to the bart station.but i must say the area around powell st and the cable car turnaround really is getting downmarket what with all the bums panhandling all day, everyday.they don't hassle you but you have to dodge them all the time.we went in december heavens knows what it would be like in the summer months.the hotel is great and the beds are wonderful i wish i could get one of these beds here in edinburgh i might get a good night's sleep!!.got a good price $110 which i think is great value.enjoy.	
Jan 16 2008 	Excellent Location comfortable stay	Parc55 is located about two minutes walk from Powell Street BART station so travelling from the airport to the hotel by train is so easy. Check in only took literally 30 seconds as the receptionist just swiped my credit card and gave me my room key. When booking, I opted for a room on one of the top floors as previous reviews have mentioned about traffic noise. The top few floors are named as an executive section, and as such this allows guests on these floors to enter the executive room on the top floor that has a small self service honesty bar, serves a continental breakfast in the morning and has a great view across the city.The room itself was very large, clean, fresh and in an excellent state of repair. I was fortunate enough to have a room on a corner of the hotel so had two large windows that gave me two different, but good views of San Francisco. The room had a large comfortable bed, large bathroom/shower, large wardrobe (and iron), sofa, TV and desk/chair. Daily maid service was excellent as was the turndown service. The room was quiet, and I didnt experience any noise either from in the hotel or from outside. Checkout through the TV was simple and I just dropped off the key in the box in the lobby on the way out. I have to admit that aside from my speedy check in, I didnt interact with the staff at all as everything was to my satisfaction and all of the services that I used could be self activated and were easy to understand and follow. I guess the only downside is that, as mentioned in a previous review, the amenities in the business centre are very expensive. I used the internet, which was somewhat pricey, but had no intention of using the printer which had an outrageous price per sheet.San Francisco is well known for its homeless population, and a great number congregate around the BART station area just around the corner from the hotel. Whilst they may be an annoyance, I found them to be harmless enough and not in the least bit aggressive. In fact, one of my evening forms of entertainment was going to a convenience store around the corner from Parc55 to buy some chocolate and join in with the banter from the people hanging around outside. This may not be everyones cup of tea for an hours entertainment in SF, but it demonstrates that these people are approachable and not out to kill us all. Parc55 is in an excellent central location. As mentioned, it is very close to the BART station, so great for the airport, and is also close to the trams that take you to Fishermans Wharf and the cable cars for exploring the city. The hotel is only a few minutes walk from the large department stores of Bloomingdales, Macys and Nordstrom as well as all of the others in Union Square.	
Jan 14 2008 	Overpriced and outdated	Yet again, here is a tale of the ratings. What constitutes a four-star accommodation in a metropolitan city with more hotels than pigeons? Four star hotels position and price themselves as &quot;superior&quot;, but, in my experience, there is very rarely any superiority to them.I rate Parc 55 &quot;Okay, but some problems&quot;. And I mean exactly that.I booked a non-smoking room with a king bed. Our room was only ready by 4 PM on check in day, but we were initially delighted to have obtained a &quot;20-th floor room with a city view&quot;. Unbelievably, street noise was almost as loud as at the street level, and indeed very disturbing during the night. To add to our discomfort, the mattress was horribly uneven, and every single spring could be felt through the thin mattress top. Pillows, on the other hand, were very small, too soft and of rather inferior quality.Our bathroom was relatively spacious, but all fixtures and decor were outdated and in a need of an upgrade (i.e. chipped wall tiles, chipped mirror and rust stains on fixtures). The bathtub drain was extremely ineffective, and we had to stand in a bath half full while taking showers. We had a desk, a chair and a small sofa with a coffee table in our room. To our disbelief, there was no mini bar and no room safe in our room. The TV was very old and small. The hotel very enthusiastically nickel-and-dimes you at any opportunity. They charge you by the minute for using their business center, and a printed page costs you more than $2. We paid a total of $11 for the luxury of checking in for our outbound flight and printing two boarding passes. When I called the front desk in the evening asking them to have a taxi for us at 5:15 AM next day, I was bluntly told that cabs were available in front of the hotel 24/7. Indeed, we had to crawl to Market Street and look for a passing taxi next morning.Altogether, they provided us with a bed and bath. I however would not recommend staying there. The general manager should walk 500 yards over to the Orchard Garden to see for himself what level of comfort and service a similarly priced same category hotel can provide.	
Jan 9 2008 	Nice Stay!	Pleasant welcome, clean and comfortable room, nice location next to Powell St. BART station, and just a couple blocks from Union Square. What more could you ask for? Oh yeah, got it for $99 on Priceline too. Add this to your list of downtown SF hotels.	
Jan 7 2008 	Great Location and Value	We booked this hotel on Priceline for $100, which is a pretty good deal for the city... although, the last 3 or 4 times we booked a room in the city for the same price on Priceline (Name Your Own Price) we've gotten either The Omni or The Westin St. Francis (which are both quite a bit nicer and overall a better value). The Parc 55 was nice enough though. Our room was very large for San Francisco, and had lots of huge windows which were very nice. There was a little sitting area by the windows which we liked, and the bed was really comfortable. We were in a great location walking distance to all the stores and restaurants in Union Square. We really didn't notice the hotel being in a bad area, but I guess we kind of knew which way not to walk to avoid being in the Tenderloin district (the people at the hotel are pretty good about informing people which way not to go). The things we did not like about the room: it smelled very musty and just gross when we arrived (there was some weird air cleaner machine in there which I guess was supposed to make it better, but really it just looked tacky and didn't do much for the smell); the bathroom was very dated and the floors did not appear to be very clean; lastly, it was really noisy in the morning due outside traffic, yelling, sirens, etc. (the hotel provided ear plugs for this). Overall, the negatives were very mild and for the price I would definitely recommend this hotel to others.	
Jan 6 2008 	A Little Too Small A Little Too Noisy	So I bookedthe room through Hotwire and you could say I got what I deserved, but usually Hotwire gets me one of those cute boutique hotels in the shopping district. This time I got a big, bland building full of glass and steel. The room was disappointingly small and not high enough up to avoid the street people screaming and acting crazy. The creepiest parts were the dirty room service tray parked right outside the room and the dirty hand towel on the rack above the toilet. My suspicion is that the staff thought they only needed to do turndown service and not a full room cleaning. So who knows if the sheets were used? Beware of the $45 parking fee. I think nearby garages will charge less. If you're willing to hoof it, I'd check theSutter/Stockton or the 5th and Mission garages.	
Jan 5 2008	DISAPPOINTED	January 4, 2008...the Bay Area's worst storm in several decades. The wind outside was ripping trees down, knocking over trucks, and carrying small children and dieters down the streets like runaway cable cars. The rain was coming down in horizontal torrents! Stepping-out of the hotel was risky. Obviously, the Parc 55 had no control over the weather. However, I didn't see them do a single thing to ease the burden of their challenged guests. Could they have offered free hot coffee and tea? No, Parc 55 decided to continue charging for this basic service. Could they have offered free WiFi to guests who were stranded in their rooms for two days? No, they charge $12.95 for internet. Could they have opened a couple of cheap bottles of wine and offered a social hour in their lounge (many hotels in SF do this)? No, their crews with ladders and other equipment commandeered the lounge to take down Christmas decorations forcing all to retire to their rooms. I spoke with the front desk suggesting that perhaps the WiFi charge could be waived concerning the circumstances, the answer was, We have no control over the weather.Don't get me wrong...Parc 55 is a beautiful property with a splendid location. I am sure that the staff was as stressed as the guests. I am disappointed, however, with the Parc 55. This was an opportunity for them to step up and make a difficult time for their guests a little better...even memorable. Too bad, huh! The whole time I was sitting in my room looking out the window, I kept wondering what the other hotels were doing for their guests.	
Jan 5 2008 	GREAT LOCATION 	My friends and I had stayed at the Parc 55 Hotel to celebrate New Year's. We chose this hotel because of its reasonable price and its close proximity to Union Square and various restaurants. I have read previous TripAdvisor reviews about the hotel being in an undesirable or &quot;seedy&quot; location. I found the hotel's surroundings to be fine, especially during the day. Cyril Magnin Street, where the hotel is located, is very busy with vehicles and pedestrian traffic. However, as with any vacation, it is always important to remain vigilant and aware of your surroundings. The check-in process was quite easy. This is a rather busy hotel which is heavily used by the flight crews of various airlines, convention attendees, and business travelers. The hotel staff was courteous and helpful, except for one of the bellmen who seemed to be having a bad day. The seven elevators were rather efficient, timely, and spacious. Our ninth floor room was typical but very accommodating. The bed was very luxurious to sleep in. The bathroom was clean with sufficient ammenities. Street noise was heard throughout the day and night, mainly from police and fire vehicle sirens. But that's typical for any downtown hotel. A temporary fitness center was created on the second floor while the regular fifth floor location is being renovated. It is heavily used by guests and only offered five (5) cardio machines. Free weights and/or resistance training equipment were not available. The only complaint that I had was the hotel's valet parking. Guests are charged $40 dollars a day (plus tax) with in-and-out privileges. This fee could add up if you plan to stay several days. Also, allow between 10-25 minutes for the parking valet person to obtain your vehicle. One day that I waited about 20 minutes. After complaining about the long wait, I was informed by the valet supervisor that my vehicle had been parked at an alternate lot because their hotel garage was full. If you arrive back to the hotel late in the evening, chances are that your vehicle will be parked at the alternate lot. If you're looking for a convenient hotel that provides affordable daily parking, you might want to consider the Cathedral Hill Hotel, just a few blocks away on Van Ness Avenue. They provide a discounted room/parking package. The daily parking fee would be about $10. Better yet, you park it yourself and leave at your own convenience.Overall, my friends and I had a pleasant stay at the Parc 55 Hotel. I would recommend it to any traveler who would like to be in the heart of Downtown San Francisco.TRAVEL TIP: Rather than travel across the busy Market Street to get to the San Francisco Shopping Centre, a quicker and possibly safer way is to go through the underground Powell Street BART station. A Starbucks Coffee is located at the mall's entrance.	
Jan 4 2008 	Great location	I think the location of this hotel is great if you enjoy Union Square and the Market Street area. My husband, my parents and I flew into Oakland and took BART into the city. The BART stop at Market and Powell is directly across the street from the hotel. While I think the hotel was in better shape when it was a Marriott property, I still think you can get a good price for a fairly nice room. The only complaint I have was that our rooms were not ready until after 5 p.m. This is a large conference hotel and several events were going on when we visited. Overall, we enjoyed our stay and will stay there in the future.	
Jan 3 2008 	Great shopping location!!	I stayed a Saturday night at Parc 55. It was the same weekend as the marathon. Our check in was quick and the room was nice size. The bed was very comfortable. Shopping is right outside the door as is the Powell Street Bart station. Easy to get from airport to hotel!!	
Jan 2 2008 	Simply the Best!!	Almost let this review get away, but I decided I definitely do want to write something about this hotel. Stayed there for 5 nights from Dec. 3-8, 2007, and didn't have one complaint about the place. I booked a few months in advance over the hotel's website and got a fabulous rate of $111 per night plus tax for the Club Room Floors. Ended up upon check-in being put on the top floor (Rm. 3209) and the room and the view (in particular) were spectacular. Stayed at the Grand Hyatt last year (also club floor) and paid more than twice this price and I really feel the Parc 55 is superior. One reason being that I had a rental car for both stays and where the Grand Hyatt you have to pull up in the street in a lot of heavy traffic to hand the car over to valet parking, the Parc 55 has a circular drive off of the street and it was a cinch. Yes, parking was $40 a night plus tax plus I tipped them each time I got the car out, but it was still cheaper than staying at one of the other hotels, given the $111 Club Level room rate here The Club Level breakfast was teriffic! Bagels, cereals, croissants, etc. Even sliced meats for breakfast if you wanted them. Couldn't have been any nicer. I lived in SF for 10 years and love driving there, maybe it's just me but I love driving on all the hills. Anyway, do not hesitate about booking here. The place was immaculate and service was outstanding, from the parking valet to the housekeeper to the front desk staff. Enjoy SF!	
Jan 2 2008 	Bad experience not worth the upgrade poor reception staff	Spend a few days at Grand hyatt , few in Monterey and back to SF for a few more at Parc 55. That was the worst experience of all.I did book quite in advance, requested a city view room, paid for an upgrade to a &quot;View&quot; room, mentioned that it was our honeymoon, and all I got when I arrived was a 21st floor room with a view at a construction yard at the back of the hotel! After numerous attempts to request a front city view I was turned down with typical answers such as &quot;we're fully booked&quot;, &quot;your room has a spectacular view, why do you want to change&quot;, &quot;try again tomorrow morning&quot;.Apart from overlooking the construction yard and hearing all the noice in the morning the stay was quite ok. Nothing special, rooms are big but the bed was not really comfortable, carpet was/looked dirty, bathroom ok, amenities ok. Cleaning staff were superdb but the front desk were really bad and counldn't be botherd. Same for the conierge who weren't very helpful and looked quite bored just sitting there.The hotel caters for a lot of business travelers and lots of airline crews! Didn't bother with any of the bar/restaurants as the are so many at close proximity.Location was great though, oposite from the Shopping centre and the Bart/cable car stations that was very convenient.Our stay at the Grand Hyatt was so much better, great rooms and views, superb beds, nice touches such as an ipod docking station, great bath and bathroom products, a lot friendlier staff.Wish I had stayed there for all part of our SF stay.Not worth the view upgrade unless they can guarantee a city view. Other wise you get as bad view as you would get with a cheaper rate but on a higher floor!	
Dec 27 2007 	2nd stay as great as the 1st	This is the 2nd time I've stayed at the Parc 55, and both times it has exceeded all expectations. There was a special offered for Dec/Jan on Travelzoo. In the past few years I have become more accustomed to nice hotels. I enjoy duvets and robes in the closet, etc., and of course this this hotel had all that, a nice sized room with an amazing view of the city, even chocolates waiting for me on the bed, turn down service, etc. It has a great location, just across from the BART/MUNI station, and good shopping at the Westfield mall, Gap, Old Navy (which is better in SF), the trolly, etc. It is in a safe part of Union Square. Best of all, I wanted to make note of the staff. They were amazingly cordial and generous, and made my stay so nice. Jose Luis at the front desk has a wonderful sense of humor and did everything possible to make my stay the best it could be after an ordeal at the airport. Thank you to him and the Parc 55--my family and I will continue to use the Parc 55 to all future trips to SF.	
Dec 27 2007 	Tainted Experience; Risky Reservations	&quot;Anyone can take a reservation; the trick is holding the reservation&quot; -- Jerry SeinfeldHad reservations for two nights, Dec 13 - 14 2007 but stayed here only one night. Why?I tried to check into this hotel early on Dec 13, when I arrived in the city. I picked this hotel because it was near Moscone Ctr and BART and had a reasonable price. This hotel is a haven for foreign flight crews leaving SFO. A flight delay meant that at least myself and the two people in line with me had been bumped from the hotel so these stewardesses could cool their heels for a few more hours. Bonus - they comp'ed my stay at the Fairmont. They gave me a taxi voucher which wasn't accepted to get to the Fairmont. It took them nearly an hour to deal with the mess on their end, and another hour to deal with getting up to the Fairmont and checked in there.I came back to the Parc 55 for my second night in the city. The room was nice, pretty much unremarkable for this class of hotel in downtown SF. Even on the second go-around the desk staff was very slow.Given all of the problems that I experienced, and the I would rather stay at one of the large number of other hotels near Union Square that might actually hold my reservation.
