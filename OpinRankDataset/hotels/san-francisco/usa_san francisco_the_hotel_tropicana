Sep 29 2009 	Great Value for SF	I was a little wary about booking this place after reading some of the reviews but it was literally the ONLY place in the whole city that had a Saturday Night vacancy the night before! We got there and we were pleasntly suprised! The room was nice and clean, cable tv, microwave and fridge and clean modern bathroom. And it only cost us $80 including tax. Its not 5* but its definitely a good place to stay in the City if your on a budget! Lets face it, you don't really spend much time in your room anyway!This isn't a traditional hotel, its more of a long term room rental with people staying for weeks/months rather than days which is why it doesn't exactly have hotel service. It is run by an Indian or Pakistani family who are actually very nice if you are nice to them!I would definitely recommend this place as a clean safe base camp for exploring the city!	
Sep 12 2009 	A clean safe place to stay in Mission	I've stayed at the Tropicana a few times, most recently with a whole bunch of other girls on our way back from Burning Man festival. The hotel is run by an Indian (?) family and is clean and very safe. The owners are very accomodating and even though they can come across a bit gruff sometimes, are actually very friendly and flexible. The rooms are basic but they have a fridge, microwave and TV. There's free wireless Internet (a bit on and off sometimes, but free) plus a free computer to use in the hall. The reception area is a part of the owners' flat, which does indeed smell like Indian food like some people on here said (which is fine for me, but apparently not for others). The rooms themselves, though, while being rather warm and lacking in air conditioning, do not smell of anything. It's not the cheapest place in the area, but knowing how horrible some of the places around Mission are, the Tropicana more than makes up for it. We were 4 in a room at one point which worked out about the same as a room in a hostel.All in all, if you want to be right in the Mission district for all the bars, etc. this is a good value, no frills hotel.	
May 3 2009 	Heaven in the Mission	Whenever I come to San Francisco, I stay at the Tropicana. I have come for Spring Break, Xmas and even to go to summer school. The family is very warm and friendly. Fatima is a great cook and even fed me when I was studying. I have stayed on every floor in the front and in the back. Once when some European girls were keeping me up talking on the back porch, I told Fatima and the next night I could sleep. The staff is very nice and the place is kept clean and painted. You can go down to the restaurant and get hot water for your tea or coffee when it is open.The restuarant is good.....ESPECIALLY the somosas and MANGO Lasse, which they would NOT give me the recipe. The location is great and I have never had a problem. In fact, last summer I was there 6 weeks and they even let me study in the restaurant.I love it and I love that the family works so hard! I could never work that hard!!!Jillina Arrigo-Pope	
Aug 28 2008 	Warning!	This is just a warning to all travelers! Even if you have a reservation, it doesnt count. My party of four reserved two rooms with two beds. One of our rooms was given away without notice. We contacted them three times to confirm our bookings. All was good until we arrived. We found out that they only booked us one room with two beds. Then to make matters more interesting, we were charged full amount for two rooms. We tried talking to the staff there, however we were told to go elsewhere if we didnt like the service. Travelers beware of this place!	
Oct 11 2007 	Horrible!!	If you're in dire need of a place to lay your head, and you're REALLY trying to save some cash (even though its way too expensive for what you're getting) then the Tropicana is the place...But, if you're looking for a pleasurable, clean, trouble-free experience, look elsewhere...The rooms are grimy, the hotel smells like a blend of rotting Arabic food and a nursing home and the service is absolutely appalling.I got to my room and noticed there wasn't any clean towels. So, like most, I proceeded to ask the manager if I may have some clean towels. She called me a liar, saying the towels in my room are clean. I guess clean towels have brown, moist spots all over them???The owners of the this hotel our flat out mean. They treat you like they hate the fact that you're staying at their hotel. Also, I slept in all my clothes. Filthy place.	
Mar 5 2007	They locked us out at 10pm!	Comfy beds yes, but very basic, i guess you get what you pay for when it comes to customer service. She wanted us to pay cash, and when we didnt come right back to her with the dollerbills she de-authorised our keycard so we couldnt get back into the room instead of just askeing us! Their choice of air freshner was a little odd too, curry, cucumber and onions i think?!? When i come back to San Fran i will stay in the Haight area, or near Golden Gate Park, there are too many burnt out bumbs in this neighbourhood.. Great burritos tho! hope this helps.	
Dec 16 2006 	Some guys just want more than they pay for	Hi,I was visiting San Francisco in 2004 and stayed in this hotel, I can´t recognize this Fatima as being rude at any time of my stay there, the room was very clean and there were four towels for me to use in one week.... I was alowed to leave my lugage in the cleaning room the last day without paying a dime..... The son is OK.... I lost my lugage on the way to USA and the family was very helpfull in this matter.... I like this hotel and will stay there in the future.... THANKSLeif Nielsen from Denmark	
Apr 19 2006	Rude Rude Rude	These people have no clue they are in the service industry. They treat you like you have the plague if you have to dare ask for anything, like a clean towel. I don't mind they don't have daily room service but I do mind that they treat me like a pain --- if I need anything due to that arrangement. Toilet paper with a smile would be my best recommendation to these incompetents. As a previous writer submitted, they are mean, rude and it's just frankly so bad that you HATE to give them your money. They are just that ingracious. I don't care how cheap and okay the rooms are (and they are just that- okay)giving horrible people my money is way too steep a price to pay.	
Jun 29 2005	Stay away from Hotel Tropicana!	Trust me, don't ever try this terrible hotel!I stayed there for ten days for the 2005 June SF Pride. At first i thought it's a clean neat and cheap accomodation option. It turned out the service was horrifying. Of the ten days i stayed, no one ever cleaned the room. Not even once! I even had to beg for new towels myself. The hotel is owned and run by an Indian family. The father and mother were just mean. The old mother is called Fatima, who's always at the counter handling hotel matters, including bookings and registration. Their website says they only accept cash, traveller's check or payment via paypal. But when i proposed to pay via paypal for my added stay at the hotel, she refused BECAUSE only her son knows about their hotel's paypal account! I had to convince her to call her son on the cell phone before i could settle the payment by paypal. So never trust what they say on their web. They don't even have a proper payment system!And... the more unbelievable happened on the day i checked out. My return flight was at 9 at night. I checked out at 1pm, thinking i could leave one of my luggages at their place or counter so i could do some final shoppings or running around before heading to the airport. BUT Fatima refused to keep my luggage, claiming that they don't have room for luggages! She even went so far as to say that no hotels will provide luggage storage! She added that even though my room was vacant for the day, they couldn't leave my luggages there BECAUSE they had to clean the room! (wow, they finally realized they had to clean the room!!) Knowing that i couldn't reason with her, i proposed to pay a few hours rental for my luggage. And u know how much she said she would charge me? - 35 dollars!!! God, their weekly room rate per night is only 50 dollars! I was so angry and dragged my luggage out of their premise, claiming that i will never go back and make sure that everyone knows about how bad their service is.And i think i'm not the only victim to their horrendous service. I recall one night some police officers had to come over and intervene in a money dispute between Fatima and some bewildered customers in backpacks sitting at the hotel lobby. I wasn't sure about the details of the dispute. I only overheard the police officer telling Fatima calm down and be more flexible and suggested the hotel should return the downpayment back to the two waiting customers so that they could leave and find another hotel. I have reasons to believe that things like this may happen a lot there.So, if u want some quality time visiting San Francisco, stay away from this --- hotel. Trust me, Hotel Tropicana will ruin your vacation in no time.	
Jun 7 2005	Awesome Inexpensive Hotel - Recommend to All	I ran into this hotel on craigslist.com offering a real great price for a weeks stay right at the start of the summer season. Other hotels were charging over $100 a nite but this place beat it by 50%. If you want a no thrills hotel which includes a refrigerator/microwave and more television channels then a lot of the high priced hotels, this is a definite option! It is centrally located off the BARTS 16th and Mission Street station so I had no problem getting off the train and walking the two blocks to the hotel. There are tons of buses that will get you everywhere you need to go. I truly enjoyed my stay and the hotel manger made it feel like a home away from home. I definite recommend you take a room with a private bath but I checked out the bath/shower room and it was always spotless and sweekie clean! They don't take credit cards so it's all cash but don't worry about having the right amount, theirs an ATM located right outside of the building. I think this place is great and I encourage the frugal travelers to consider this place the next time they plan to head out to San Francisco. Best of Luck! ;+)	
Apr 19 2005	solid cheap place to stay if you're on a budget	So, I found this on craigslist in san francisco. I was moving there and needed a place to stay while looking for an apartment. Basically, this place was an SRO years ago, and was taken over, remodeled and turned into a sort of europeanish hotel. It's basically a decent step up from staying at a hostel. I got a private room, all the appliances were new, in fact all the furniture is also new. For 250 (they were running a special) I got a room with a sink/bed/fridge/micro (decent sized fridge)/TV/Cable and wireless internet access. Considering I looked around, this was the best deal (the few cheaper places weren't much cheaper, and the more expensive places were around 350/wk). If I had opted to pay 350/week, I could have had a private bathroom. For what I needed it was perfect, though by the end of the stay (2 weeks) I was tired of schlepping down the hall to shower or go to the bathroom (though it did save me $200 total). The room was comfortable and the place was quiet and centrally located. It's not the ritz, but for the price, it's a decent value. It's true about the cash only policy, which I thought a little weird, but whatever. The owners also appear to live on the second floor, so I very often came home to the smell of cooking (usually curry) and that's a mixed bag. Sometimes I liked it, and it made me hungry, other times I would have preferred not to smell it, but I was staying on the third floor and my room always smelled nice. Another potential annoyance is if you take the shared shower setup, you always run the risk of having to &quot;wait&quot; for the shower (which happened to me once, and was a potential annoyance making me worry about being late for a work meeting). There is a shower on the other side, which I ended up using. That could potentially be a hassle, but again, it's a budget place so you have to give something up for that.If you're planning on staying in SF and don't want to hostel it, this is definitely worth it. It's not exactly comparable to a hotel (unless you get a private bathroom), it's more like a clean dorm room without the parties. Frankly, the next cheapest thing I could find in a real hotel was at least $60 a night (so $420 a week, not including tax). Overall, if you need a cheap place and prefer at least some modicum of privacy, I'd recommend.	
Jul 22 2004	Staff helped me find my luggage....	The hotel was really cheerful and modern (they had wi-fi) also I lost my luggage and the staff used everything in thier power to help me out, they even stayed up late to accept my luggage......:-)	
Jul 14 2004	Booked me at one price and tried to charge me another	I booked my room a few weeks in advance of my trip to S.F., and when I called the night before to confirm they wanted to charge me DOUBLE the price we agreed to when I made the reservation. Since they only accept cash there is notpaper trail or record of the price they promise, so they feel entitled to lie when you book and try to rip you off when you arrive. Thankfully I called the night before and was able to rebook, but when I cancelled they had the nerve to write ME a nasty email. BEWARE!
