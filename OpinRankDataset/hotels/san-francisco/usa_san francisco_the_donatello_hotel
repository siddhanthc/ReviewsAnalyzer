	Friendly Service..A+ Location..Clean Spacious Rooms	So close to everything you would want. Located in the heart of Union Square, lots of great dining choices nearby, close to cable car lines and other public transportation. Large rooms for San Francisco with very comfortable beds! The staff was extra friendly and helpful. Free in room coffee and newspaper daily. We will most certainly stay here when we visit San Francisco again!	
Nov 25 2009 	Great Time in San Francisco	We arrived at the Donatello before our rooms were ready and had plans for lunch and than a night trip to Alcatraz. The front desk said no problem we will have your bags in your rooms when you get back. We asked for directions to the waterfront and said we wanted to walk. They gave us the best directions for staying on the flat ground. After a fun night on &quot;The Rock&quot;, we made our way back to the hotel via cable car. Our bags were all set up in our rooms as promised. The next day I asked the best way to the freeway to get to Napa. The directions were very accuarte. After a hard day tasting wine we arrived back to comfortable rooms and beds. The staff were very accomadating and encouraged the use of the concierge if we needed anything. The hotel is in the heart of the city. Close to Union Square, shopping, cable cars and dining. I would highly recommend staying at the Donatello if you are going to San Francisco.	
Nov 25 2009 	Amazing Hotel	The Donatello is very nice hotel. The rooms are huge and very clean. Good and new beds. The staffs are very polite. It is very close to Union Square, just 2 blocks. The trolley pass just 1 block and and their restaurant is very good with alive music.	
Nov 23 2009 	If you are looking for value friendliness and semi-luxury this is it	Not overly luxurious (Ritz) but just right, very clean, spacious room with microwave and refrigerator.Clean, wonderful location, probably one of the best as 2 minutes from Union square but not noisy.Union square is where most tours leave from, public transportation and cable cars are everywhere.The staff is incredibly well trained and courteous. They will actually encourage you to use the concierge. They will call her for you and she will point out restaurants on the map and help you with anything you need with a smile. Exceeded my expectations, paid $140 per night hotels.com.Felt good to pay the bill, was worth it.	
Nov 17 2009 	Great location rooms and service	Our group of 6 girls stayed in this hotel for a few days in October. We really enjoyed our stay here. From check in, where a very kind gentleman checked us in to the rooms which were spacious and clean. Location was great, just a few mins walk to union square (close to thye shops) and mins from most buses and trams. This hotel was great value for money and so too was our breakfast. we ate in the hotel also and were treated very well to a lovely meal. Rooms were cleaned daily. Staff were friendly and helpful. Really recommend this hotel.	
Nov 16 2009 	Nice clean spacious room great location	The hotel is definitely aging--especially the elevators, but the nice clean spacious rooms, great location (a block from Union Square and close to everything), and attentive staff more than make up for it. The room was very comfortable, with turn-down service every evening. Bathroom was nice, great water pressure in the shower.Only two complaints: 1. I was on the 10th floor and could still hear a lot of street noise from below. I had to turn on the fan to block it out so I could sleep, but that's the price to pay for being right in the middle of everything. 2. Relatively pricey, especially if you have a car to park.Also, I would skip the $7 breakfast...it's not worth it.	
Nov 16 2009 	The Prefect Hotel	Have visited San Francisco several times and this was the best hotel we have stayed inClean and very comfortable with very helpful and friendly staff. Would be happy to recommend it.	
Nov 15 2009 	Great location and great hotel	My friend and I had our &quot;girls&quot; weekend away in San Francisco. For the thrid year in a row we've stayed at the Donatello Hotel and enjoyed it. My husband and I stay there whenever we're in San Francisco. Our room is always spacious, clean and quiet. The location is perfect for shopping and dining. They have a nice guest floor where they serve coffed in the morning. All the staff is friendly and extremely helpful. We look forward to it every year.	
Nov 13 2009 	Perfect experience	This hotel was perfect. It was a brilliant location - lovely building, REALLY close to Union Square and we had no trouble with noise. Just a block or two away and the streets get a little mroe dodgy so this was ideal.The rooms were lovely with enormous windows, the service was excellent. Would definetly go back.	
Nov 12 2009 	Excellent Experience I have stayed At the Donatello 6-8 times 	The rooms are very spacious with &quot;over the top&quot; superior beds. When traveling a great night sleep is very important to me. The amenities and cleanliness is excellent, also.I have felt that the staff: housekeeping, bellmen, and front desk people have always treated me like they are anxious to assist me while I am a guest in the hotel.  I have stayed at the Donatello 6 to 8 times, sometimes with my husband, daughter, granddaughter or a girlfriend and each of my guests were impressed with the Hotel.  I especially enjoy the fact that it is one block to Union Square shopping, Theaters and great restaurants.	
Nov 11 2009 	Great staff corporate attitude towards guests	Large, newly updated rooms, in a convenient Union Square location. Staff very accommodating.	
Nov 11 2009 	Lots of Bang for the Buck	Excellent hotel - the second time I've stayed here. The rooms are very spacious, and immaculately clean. Very comfortable bed. The front desk staff and concierges are friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. Its location, one block from Union Square, can't be beat. Small quibbles - the bathrooms are small-ish and somewhat dated, and I personally prefer a down comforter to a heavy bedspread. But all in all the Donatello offers you a large clean comfortable room, an excellent stay and great value.	
Nov 10 2009 	Always a pleasure	I have always enjoyed staying at the Donatello. The staff is so helpful and accommodating. The rooms are comfortable and first class. Thanks again for a wonderful stay.	
Nov 10 2009 	THIS IS THE PLACE!!!	If we ever come back to San Francisco we will stay here again. It was a delightful experience. The staff were excellent in all ways. They helped us find our way around on the cable cars, buses, streetcars and the Bart. The room was so clean and large and it was nice not to be cramped up in a small hotel room. Their restaurant had very good food also.	
Nov 9 2009 	Excellent hotel.	Excellent hotel. We had a large studio room on the 9th floor. King size bed with fold out sofabed for our teenager. Very spacious room even with leaving the foldout sofa open the entire time we were there. Very clean room and bathroom. Very helpful and friendly staff. Concierge very available for reservations, suggestions, etc. Valet for parking your car or catching you a taxi. Desk staff very friendly. Daily maid service and nightly turn-down service with chocolates. Everyone very professional. Room had a small foyer with closet and dresser and mirror. Large bathroom. Very clean bathroom. Water pressure in shower extremely strong!!!! Room had dishes, glassware and silverware for 2, small fridge, microwave, coffeemaker with coffee, sugar. Salt and pepper. Small bar sink with towel. Some shelving at efficiency set up. Very nice and well used by us. Room had a flat screen TV in a armoire with more side shelving on both sides for storage. Desk with chair and lamp. Also had 2 additional lamps and bedside/sofa-side tables. Also, club level lounge. It had coffee, tea, hot chocolate, hot water, tables and chairs to sit, eat, relax. We brought our lunch up there on a warm, sunny day. The doors to outside deck were open. Very nice. Useful and quiet. Saw a few people working on their laptops here also. Also had a wine and cheese hour from 4-5pm which looked to be well attended. Small gym on club level floor. Stayed here Nov. 3-8. Great location. One block to cable cars. Bus stop outside. One block to the heart of Union Square. Cafes, restaurants very close, same block or one to two block walk. Plenty of stores for shoppers. Lots to do in San Francisco. Hotel very well priced considering its location, room size, amenities, etc. Very nice room to come back to at the end of a day of sightseeing. Would very definitely stay here again. Highly recommend this hotel. Our first visit to San Francisco. Loved the city. Loved the hotel. Only suggestion. Request a higher level floor to be away from sounds of the jazz music in the 2nd floor restaurant if you prefer quiet. Our room on 9th floor was just right for us.	
Nov 9 2009 	Adequate/Convenient	I picked the Donatello based on the great reviews this website, as well as the great rate I got. I think the reviews are a tad generous, I had higher expectations. It is in a decent location and the staff were extremely friendly and very helpful. The room was spacious, but the bathroom and decor were a bit worn/old but clean. The bed was comfortable. The microwave and mini fridge were a nice bonus in addition to the coffee maker. I didn't check out the fitness area or any other part of the hotel, so I am not sure what that was like. I just needed a place conveniently located and relatively safe area, but reasonably priced, since I only stayed 1 night.I was on the 6th floor, and I could hear traffic and the cable cars (Powell is a block away) at night. But , the location is very close to Union Square so it is a trade off. If you are light sleeper bring earplugs or get a higher floor. There is a computer you can use in the lobby , but there is only 1. So I had to wait to use it, but I think there is free wi fi if you have brought own laptop.	
Nov 9 2009 	Perfect choice-will stay here again!	The Donatello is perfectly located one block from from Union Square, so you're surrounded by amazing shopping, restaurants and cable car stops. The hotel staff was wonderful-helpful with maps, umbrellas, cabs-anything we needed was provided quickly and pleasantly! The room was very large-my husband and I shared the king size bed, while my daughter slept on the pull out sofa bed, and we had plenty of room to maneuver. An excellent experience all around.	
Nov 6 2009 	Wonderful room with great location	We stayed at the Donatello for 2 nights and we were very pleased with the friendly and informative staff, great spacious room and wonderful location. On the club floor there is coffee, tea and comfortable seating to relax. It was a wonderful perk and a great way to start our day.	
Nov 5 2009 	Best value in SF	We stay here because the hotel delivers the most spacious and updated rooms for the price. Most hotels in SF (even the recently remodeled ones) are older w/ really small rooms. Yes, you're here to see the city, not the room, but a little extra space is always a good thing. Plus there's the minifrig, micro, champagne glasses, etc. to help stretch your travel dollars. The staff was great; let us check into our room early. After walking the city all afternoon we took our champagne to the 14th floor terrace and enjoyed the sunshine (it was an amazing 75 degrees in Nov!). We'll definitely be back and recommend this to all our friends.	
Nov 4 2009 	Excellent Service and Value for Money	From the moment we arrived the staff were helpful and willing to answer any questions. We were delighted at being able to get into our room early. The room was compact but well equipped and very comfortable. The access to a lounge with complimentary warm beverages and an alternative place to sit and read/talk etc was brilliant.Located just one block from Union Square the location could not be better. Our children (aged 5 and 7) loved the spa and donuts for breakfast! I had requested a quiet room on a higher floor and this was provided.We will definitely stay here agin and recommend this hotel for all visitors to San Francisco.	
Nov 3 2009 	Consistently Good	We have stayed at the Donatello many times. The first was when we got engaged back in 1988! The staff is always great and seem to love their jobs. Rooms are comfortable, clean and have a frig, micro and sink that makes snacking easy. The hotel is a real bargain considering the quality of the rooms and staff and the location.	
Nov 2 2009 	Knee Deep in the Hoopla	The Donatello is located in a great part of San Francisco, very close to Union Square, the cable cars, and China Town. A great deal of energy flows through this area, as well as the accompanying noise. So think of yourself as being part of a daily performance art exhibit including laughing, yelling people, honks, bus brakes and bums. It's quieter during the work week but spikes on the weekends.For the most part, it was invigorating. However, when you want to 'turn it off', the huge single-pane windows can only hold back so much - although they do partially compensate by opening a crack to let in the brisk air. It can be especially rancorous when the beer bottles start to fly or your neighbor uses the powerful plumbing (Mgmt: try looking into some hammer arresters).If you can deal with the hubbub, you will be treated with a nicely sized room with all of the necessities but not much in the way of trendy furniture (or calming color choices - unless you are a Bears or Gators fan). Beds are just to my liking - not too hard and not too soft. Yes, there is an icebox, safe, and wet bar.As you will typically find in this great city, service is great and friendly. Getting to your room is always a snap w/ two quick elevators and short hallways.For the money, you probably can't beat it, but it's not for the overly picky or sensitive tourist set that shouldn't be despoiling the city anyways. If you are traveling from the Fatherland w/ Bosha and can't figure out that a cable car is not your personal taxi: please stick to South Beach - they're waiting for you.	
Nov 2 2009 	Very Enjoyable Stay	There were 21 family members from Hawaii attending my son's wedding in San Fran and we had a very enjoyable stay at the Donatello Hotel. The entire staff were very friendly and helpful. The Front Desk &amp; Bell men greeted us every morning as we were on our way to enjoy the city and told us to have a nice day. The rooms were very spacious and clean. The location was excellent, just one block from Union Square and 3 blocks from the cable car turnaround and Bart station. Lots of eating places close by as well.	
Nov 1 2009 	Great location great value and comfortable clean rooms	We had a four night stay and were quite satisfied. The location is great; we walk when we travel, and we walked all over San Francisco from this hotel. It is only a 6 block walk from the BART stop for easy access to/from SFO. The pillows were a tad on the large/hard side, but other than that our stay was perfect. We would definitely stay here again.	
Oct 28 2009 	Great Location--Helpful and Friendly Staff--Large and Clean Rooms	I stayed at the Donatello for the American Academy of Ophthalmology. The location in Union Square is great, and the property is fantstic. Upon checking in, I noticed my cell phone had run down its charge and realized I forgot to pack the charger--sure enough the front desk had a spare and gave me free use for the few days I was there. The 5th floor room was huge and clean and even had a nice courtyard area with a table in the back. The front desk staff always had a smile and a hello when I came and went and really made me feel welcomed. I would certainly stay there again. The concierge even set me up with a rental (just two block away) so I could drive to Yosemite for the day. In the general area, two restaurants that I enjoyed--the Daily Grill--is a pub type atmosphere with a nice menu and was perfect for dining alone and Farallon was a nice seafood restaurant with one-of-a-kind decor...	
Oct 27 2009 	A very good hotel and good value	A very good location , a large room that fits also to more than 2 people. The staff is very friendly and helpful.	
Oct 26 2009 	Average	After reading all the very positive reviews, we expected a little more of this hotel. All in all it is average, however the location could not be any better.	
Oct 25 2009 	Superb place to stay	Fantastic location, helpful friendly staff, clean greatsized rooms with everything you need and amazing value for money	
Oct 23 2009 	Top location and great sized rooms with excellent value breakfast.	An easy walk up from Powell Station this hotel offers great value for money in addition to a huge room and a wonderful $7 breakfast. The staff were all very helpful and made our first hotel on our US holiday a great experience.	
Oct 21 2009 	nice great value great location	Considering the quality and location of this hotel, for the price (~$160/night) this is really great value. Rooms are spacious and comfortable. Very close to BART, for those coming from the airport, and right near the 30 bus (Exploratorium, Ghirardhelli, City Lights bookstore, North Beach, Chinatown, etc.). Also quite close to Dotty's True Blue Cafe, which was excellent for breakfast (went on a Friday morning, 1 hour from getting in line to being served our food - weekends are probably much worse).The desk staff was very helpful and friendly. My only complaint was that our second night there, as we were getting ready for bed around 11pm, someone started insistently knocking on our door and then, when we didn't immediately answer, tried to come in (although they couldn't because we had used the additional locks). When I peered out, there was a hotel employee asking me if the room was clean. WTF? First, yes, it was, and second, why the hell would anyone ask this at 11pm? Are there maids on call then? And who would want a maid in their room at 11pm anyway? When we checked out we told the desk clerk about this, and she noted it and said they would investigate. As far as I can tell, this was just one stupid employee in an otherwise very nice hotel.	
Oct 21 2009 	Everything we'd hoped for after reading Trip Advisor	Title says it all really :)1 block from Union square and Cable Cars and about 10 min leisurely walk to Moscone conference center. Breakfast no longer free but excellent value for 7USD per person.Free use of Jacuzzi, sauna and Gym.Rooftop garden with nice lounge and free tea, coffee etc.Rooms are BIG and beds HUGE equipped with microwave, coffee maker, fridge and basic kitchen stuff (knives, corkscrew etc).Friendly knowledgeable staff.Parking is a bit pricey (Valet service 28USD) but if you're a guest you have unlimited In/Out privileges during the 24 hrs.Good for kids - great location. Wouldn't hesitate to recommend and would definitely stay again.	
Oct 17 2009 	Elegant	Its a beautiful hotel right in the heart of the shopping center, easy walking distance to the cable car and restaurants etc.	
Oct 17 2009 	Nice hotel	We stayed here for 2 nights at the end of our trip to San Francisco. Upon arrival, the staff were very friendly and helpful. The room was clean and very spacious and had a comfortable bed, large flat screen TV and dvd player. The hotel also offers complimentary wi-fi and tea and coffee on the top floor.The only downside really was that the room was quite noisy. We were on the 11th floor, but could still hear the traffic on the street below. The only reason we give this hotel 4 stars is that we also stayed at the Parc 55 hotel on the same trip and found this to be a better hotel in a better location.	
Oct 16 2009 	Great room-TerribleWi-Fi	I was in town for a conference and the room was awesome! Chocolate every evening! However, I needed to do some work and the wi-fi was terrible! It would be nice if there was a default LAN line that I could tap into, I would have given the rating a 5!	
Oct 15 2009 	Great stay once again.	My mother, two young children, and I stayed at the Donatello on 10/11/09. I attended a Shell Vacations owners' update meeting, so I had already stayed my two nights (10/09-10/10) at another hotel in Fisherman's Wharf. I wanted to extend the weekedn trip, so I decided to use my Shell Vacations points for the Donatello. We stayed at the Donatello in August, and our stay was great once again. Everybody at the front desk is super friendly and helpful, and they made us feel very welcome to be back again. The only thing that was different, was that there was no free continenatl breakfast anymore. My family and I enjoyed the breakfast so much in August, but they did not have it anymore. I guess they are trying to save on food and beverage costs (?). But overall, the hotel was still wonderful, and we will definitely be returning again soon!	
Oct 14 2009 	You will not be disappointed when you select the Donatello Hotel in San Francisco.	I have a time share at the Donatello but I have also used the hotel if rooms come available when there is nothing available with my time share. The bar is a hot spot and they have happy hour every night. The bar tenders are gracious and knowledgable. Not a large bar but comfortable. They often have live music. Every person connected with my stay go out of their way to make you feel wanted and at home. The bell staff give you the impression that it is not just a job but a profession! One of my favorites has been employed there for 17 years. The location is excellent--a block from the Geary and Curran Theatres--a block from Union Square which is surrounded by many major shopping venues. It has been awhile since I have dined at the restaurant but I hear the food is great. On Friday nights there is a wine tasting reception with an array of goodies. The rooms are clean and sparkle. The ammenities are exceptional. It also has a fully equiped exercise area and a spa. The only negative is that the parking is not included. It's my home in the City.	
Oct 13 2009 	A great place to stay near Union Square	The Donatello Hotel is a great place to stay when visiting San Francisco. It is located a block from Union Square and within walking distance of Chinatown and Knob Hill. The rooms are clean and spacious and include a kitchen area with microwave. We enjoyed shopping in Union Square and visiting the restaurants in the area. We also spent several afternoons enjoying the walking tours sponsored by City Guides, it is a great way to learn about the city and get some exercise at the same time. The hotel has a happy hour every day at 4:00 featuring half price appetizers and low priced drinks, it was a great place to relax after the walking tours.	
Oct 13 2009 	EXCELLENT WILL STAY AGAIN AND AGAIN	great hotel - location, rooms large and very clean. staff a pleasure to deal withwill stay again and again excellent breakfast, fine resturanttvsev	
Oct 12 2009 	convenient location	Stayed in the Presidential Suite for my husband's 50th b'day with my sister and her husband. When we checked in the front desk person stated &quot;Oh the Presidential Suite&quot;, we thought &quot;Wow this must be pretty special&quot;. Decor is very dated. Although it appeared clean the look of the bathrooms and age of the furniture made you feel otherwise. The bathrooms were very dated, marks on mirrors, painted old vanities. Shower heads were extremely low on the wall. The water pressure of the 2nd bath shower was poor. Main toilet kept running water unless you held the lever down for the entire flush. Maintainence came up immediately to fix it, but the problem was no better. The unit was very large and roomy.On another note, the staff was extremely pleasant and helpful.	
Oct 11 2009 	A perfect destination	Our stay at the Donatello exceeded our expectations. The location was right in the center of art galleries, fine restaurants, major theaters, and close to transportation that took us to all parts of the city. The room was quiet and spacious as well as clean. The beds were comfortable. Advice from the front desk was extremely helpful in getting directions and obtaining theater tickets. The breakfast in the restaurant bar was certainly adequate and effcient. We enjoyed being at the center of the city.	
Oct 11 2009 	Great Bargin For a 4 Star Hotel	We found the Donatello to be Clean and well taken care of. The staff there was always at our service and friendly. We found the location to be perfect for all our needs. It is close to China town, Union Square, And several Resturants. Most of our shopping and sight seeing could be done by walking just a few blocks,eliminating fighting traffic or taxi fares.	
Oct 10 2009 	CENTRAL COMFORTABLE BUT DECOR STUCK IN THE 'SEVENTIES	The Donatello is rather gloomy inside, very much stuck in the 'seventies and not the 'boutique hotel' I had seen it described as! However, the double room we had was HUGE with mirrors all over the place, sofa, plenty of wardrobe space and a massive bed. A little dingy - not dirty but could do with a facelift... Comfortable and VERY central, just off Union Square. Not hideously expensive for the position and I'd recommend it for a short stay (we were there 3 nights).	
Oct 8 2009 	Unique and comfortable hotel in a great location	This was our third time staying at the Donatello. As always the service was great although we did not enjoy the concierge trying to get us to go to a time share talk! No thank you, I'm on vacation! Other than that there was no issues. The rooms have a very unique color palate of royal blue and orange but its very comfortable and plenty of room. A great bonus is that each room comes with a partial kitchen including dishes, mini fridge, microwave, toaster, sink and towels. It was a great money saver to make our own breakfast every morning. This hotel also has a great location in union square, its just a few blocks to the cable cars and lots of shopping.	
Oct 7 2009 	Simply perfect	I spent a week in this hotel with my wife in September 09, and we loved every moment of our stay. Staff was extremely helpful. Our room was excellent, very spacious, well equipped and everything was brand new. Also, location was great, close to cable cars, department stores, bus stops and lots of restaurants and shops. I would definitely come back to Donatello in my next trip to San Francisco.	
Oct 7 2009 	Good value for location	Just returned from a Bay Area trip, which included a couple of nights in SF, at The Donatello. For our purposes you could not ask for a better location. Along with adequate rooms; reasonably priced parking and very courteous and helpful staff', we thought the hotel provided good value.A couple of nits however...the complimentary breakfast as noted on their website no longer exists. If you choose to partake what is essentially continental breakfast (with a few packages of instant oatmeal and hard boiled eggs thrown in), you will be charged $7/person. We did not, when we looked at the spread.Next, when I took a shower upon my arrival, the tub was so clogged, I was up to my ankles in water. While an engineer came to repair it immediately, you would think that someone from the housekeeping staff might have noticed prior to a new check in.All that said, we would probably return if we had similar needs.	
Oct 5 2009 	Generally good but a couple of problems	Good location in town, decent sized rooms and pretty helpful staff. However, having two separate companies promoting their services at reception and the club level was a little weird. Rooms were OK, but not great. Cheap cutlery and questionable decor. The bed spread in particular did not look very clean. The breakfast was OK if you got there early enough. However, our biggest problem was the location of the room. Our room was on the first level of accommodation, near the end of the hallway above a banquet room. Traffic noise wasn't a problem for us, but the room was also accessible through our window via the flat roof of the banquet room, so security was a concern if we left our window open. The plumbing in this particular room was also very loud with pipes creaking and waking us up every night. The staff tried to identify the problem, but weren't able to sort if out while we were there. Overall the hotel was OK but not good.	
Oct 5 2009 	Great location	Nice hotel with a great location.The hotel was clean and personnel helpful and friendly.A bit of noise during the evening/night but nothing to complain very much about unless you are sensitive to noise.What made the hotel GREAT was the location just a few minutes walk from the city centre.	
Oct 5 2009 	Excellent downtown S.F. hotel	The location of The Donatello at Post and Mason is as close as you can get to the downtown shopping scene in the city. The rooms are very nice, there are usable amenities, and the staff are pleasant and helpful. The in-and- out parking is very convenient. We enjoyed our stay.	
Oct 5 2009 	My favorite San Francisco hotel because of the location and service.	I have stayed at the Donatello many times and will continue to do so. The great location and outstanding professional staff make each stay a pleasure. I did think my room needed a paint job and some redecorating, but for the size and price of the room, you cannot beat it. The top floor lounge is a special treat.	
Oct 3 2009 	Pleasant surprise.	My permanence at the Donatello was very pleasant. I was expecting a decent Hotel , instead I found an upscale place with excellent service. Rooms in San Francisco are usually small with lower ceiling. My room at the Donatello was large , pleasantly set up , with high ceiling and large windows. For sure, next time in San Fran , I'll visit this hotel. And by the way, right in the middle of the shopping!	
Oct 3 2009 	Great hotel great location great value	Great Location! We walked everywhere and/or took the local transportation. The hotel staff was very nice and very helpful. We loved the feel of the botique hotel. The beds were comfortable and the rooms nice and clean.We would stay here again and again!The only problem we encountered was at a breakfast place on Taylor street and cross street O'farrell. I had my wallet taken out of my purse while I was sitting at the table. I was lucky enough to catch the the thief........but the breakfast place (Which was labeled &quot;best breakfast in town, Zagat award&quot; did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! Didn't offer to call the cops, didn't offer to kick the thief out. ( The thief got scared and got her food to go after I caught her and retrieved my wallet back.) Didn't comp our breakfast.Other than that, WE LOVE SAN FRAN AND THE SERVICE IN MOST AREAS! THE DONATELLO IS AWESOME!	
Sep 30 2009 	Escape from Reality	We were greeted by the doorman who not only escorted us from the car to our spacious room, but introduced us to the clerk who efficiently registered us in moments. Later the concierge effortlessly attained for us a Saturday night reservation at a local restaurant. Our getaway weekend to the City by the Bay was enhanced by our stay at the Donatello.	
Sep 28 2009 	Excellent Customer Service good value	Stayed here for 3 nights after leaving the Columbus Motor Inn because of a noisy room. The customer service is superb but the hotel itself is showing it's wear and tear. When we got to the room there was black mold all along the tub. The staff quickly took care of this and to my satisfaction immediately when notified. They offer wine tasting on Friday's which is nice and have coffee, tea, and hot chocolate available at your leisure. It is right by Union Square which is great because you have access to many restaurants and shopping establishments within walking distance. Also nearby are many homeless individuals hanging out in the streets but overall we felt safe. I am grateful to The Donatello because they were able to accomodate us when we had to make a last minute reservation after the problems we had at Columbus Motor Inn. I would definitely stay here again.	
Sep 27 2009 	Superlative service accomodations and comforts abound at The Donatello!	Our recent stay at The Donatello Hotel continued to meet all expectations. It''s convenient location just off Union Square adds to its charm, and the adjacent, reasonable valet parking garage is an added bonus when traveling by car. If you enjoy being able to walk to superb restaurants and some of the best shopping that San Francisco offers, then the Donatello is for you. After a long day of work or play, the friendly staff and a fitness center with sauna and a whirlpool await you. Our stay in the Presidential Suite was &quot;frosting on the cake&quot;, providing a spacious 2 bedroom, dining room and living room layout with all the comforts of home. Would we come back to this jewel of a place? You bet we would......and we have, many times.	
Sep 25 2009 	GREAT LOCATION FRIENDLY STAFF	We stayed for five nights at this hotel. The reception was very friendly. The bedroom was large and very clean. Towels and linen changed every day. Continental breakfast was also provided and was very good. Plenty of toast, pastries, cereals, tea and coffee. The hotel has a great location being only two minutes from Union Square and transport. Would recommend this hotel for the short stay visitor.	
Sep 25 2009 	Comfort and good value in a central location	We used the Donatello for three nights, on arrival from UK and whilst waiting to pick up an RV. I chose this hotel on the basis of comments by other guests on TripAdvisor and was not disappointed. The staff on Reception were very friendly and happy to give advice on getting the best out of our short stay. The bedroom was huge (as was the bathroom) and had a kitchenette of sink, microwave, fridge and coffee maker. The on-line rate seemed excellent value, as it included continental breakfast. this has recently been improved - it is now served on the mezzanine floor alongside the restaurant, so there is a better supply of fruit, cereal and savouries to supplement the pastries and coffee. The hotel is just one block from Union Square, which reduces the noise, and a short walk (even with wheeled cases) from the BART and the cable car terminus. A good location for sight-seeing, as you can go north to Fisherman's Wharf on the cable car and then come back via the trams along the coast.	
Sep 24 2009 	the Donatello is excellent	we had the presidential suite since there were 3 of us. the staff extends every extra courtesy and the location is right in the middle of everything. we didn't get on the roof deck b/c it was windy, but that would have been even better. i recommend this hotel.	
Sep 22 2009 	A hotel with exceptional customer service	I, along with my family, recently had the pleasure of staying at the Donatello. I was impressed with the hotel even before I arrived. My phone calls to the hotel prior to my arrival were quickly answered. The staff was knowledgeable and helpful. They even remembered that I had previously called. Although we arrived prior to the 3pm check-in time, we were well cared for. The bell captain was there to take our bags and we were checked in. We were called when the rooms became available.The hotel itself is well situated, a block from the cable cars and close to stores and restaurants. Convenient parking is available, both at the hotel and a near-by lot with in and out privileges at a reasonable cost.The rooms are spacious and inviting, with high ceilings and windows that open. I especially enjoyed the roof-top lounge, with fireplace and inside and outside seating, a great place for that first or last coffee of the day. Another great service at this hotel: printed directions to help you navigate San Franciso.TThere are many wonderful things at the Donatello, but what impressed me the most was their welcoming staff.	
Sep 22 2009 	friendly accomadating Great location	Park your car and leave it! Then walk take the trolley take the street car, That is the best way to get around San Francisco.	
Sep 22 2009 	Wonderful hotel and great location!	This was our first trip to SF. The Donatello was in a great central location to use public transportion for where we wanted to go. The room was very clean and comfortable. The free continental breakfast was also a big plus for choosing this hotel.	
Sep 22 2009 	I''ll stay here again!	Great hotel! Perfect location in uinion square, place with lots of shops and very plent of vitality. Near the cablecar line, near Powell street station. The staff is incredibly welcoming, polite and willing to help you in every kind of problem. The room and bathroom are very spacious, clean, comfortable with some forniture to eat (microwave, cup of glasses, mug, forks, spoons, toaster, etc.). Plus I hate the hotel with only the moquet on the floor because of my allergy for the dust, but here the floor of the hall is made with a beautiful marble. I appreciate it.	
Sep 18 2009 	wonderful stay	From the moment we arrived at the Donatello we were treated like honored guests by the parking attendant, bellman and front desk receptionist. Because it was our wedding anniversary, we were treated to a complimentary bottle of wine and chocolates. Our room was spacious and, as requested, on a higher floor off the street to escape the city noises. The funky furnishings were pleasant and very functional, with lots of storage space. The mini kitchen was very handy for snackers like us. The club room on the top floor was a lovely place to sit and talk. The continental breakfast in the restaurant was very adequate and like us, we saw that most people had vouchers and didn't have to pay the normal $7 charge. The only negatives were some peeling paint on the bottom of our bathroom door, discolored grout around the tub that didn't look clean even if it was, and a loose faucet in the mini bar. But I considered those minor for a great hotel at the right price in the heart of the action where you could walk everywhere. We even walked to the pier for the Alcatraz Ferry. Would I stay at the Donatello again? You Bet!	
Sep 18 2009 	Great location and conveniences	I would highly recommend this hotel. The king size bed was great and fold out large and comfortable. The mini kitchen was very handy.As far as location it's great to be in the Union Square area which gives you great access to all the transit, cable cars, great shopping etc.	
Sep 17 2009 	very good value at superlocation	This hotel is at the location you want to be in San Francisco. Very close to the shopping area of Union Square and walking distance to all other touristic areas of San Francisco. The rooms are clean and spacious and the service is very good. Very friendly personnel and nice jazzbar with live music and good food.	
Sep 17 2009 	Friendly efficient service; great location; large rooms; windows that open--who could ask for more?	Our group of nine adults gets together annually. Because this year was our 50th wedding anniversary, we got to pick the venue. Knowing how pictures can &quot;lie,&quot; I visited at least two dozen hotels around Union Square in San Francisco and was delighted that the Donatello was within our price range. The standard rooms are larger than any others in the nearby hotels--and the windows open, a real plus for me. From booking through checkout, service from everyone was friendly and efficient. The rooms are equipped with a microwave, fridge, and basic dishware. Friday afternoon wine and cheese was augumented during our stay with appetizers from a local restaurant; we had an enjoyable hour socializing with other guests. The free continental breakfast (which apparently was not everyone's favorite) has been replaced by a self-serve buffet ($7/person added to your bill) at the Zingari restaurant bar (accessible by hotel elevator). I'm unclear about the relationship between the restaurant and the hotel, but would recommend the restaurant as well. My husband and I have eaten there many times and never had less than good to excellent food and service. This time they were even willing to provide us with separate checks (a must at these reunions).We had rooms on the 8th, 9th, and 10th floors and had no complaints about noise. Our rooms faced Mason St.; rooms facing Post might be noisier. The hotel is in the center of a major city, after all, so it's not going to be as quiet as a wilderness.The hotel is a resort, but I asked that we not be given a sales pitch. That was not our purpose for getting together. Information about the properties is in each room.	
Sep 14 2009 	Great 	Spent 2 nights here getting reacquainted with the city after a 30 year absence. The room &amp; the service were perfect with every amenity one could want; including a robe, microwave, fridge, the daily newspaper under your door and even a chocolate left when your bed was turned down for the night! There is a $7.00 charge now for the continental breakfast which I would skip and instead hit one of the many spots in the Union Square area that serve breakfast for not much more than this price. Free coffee, tea etc. is available all day in the top floor lounge and rooms have coffee makers as well. Would definitely stay at the Donatello again.	
Sep 13 2009 	This was perfect	The staff were excellent throughout the hotelgreat happy hour with good food and drinksthere is a small spa upstairs on the club level-not very exciting-but it is there if you want itthis is a great location,walking distance to almost everythingrecommendations for restaurants near by were very good,try Fino-great italianthis will be our San Francisco hotel for all future trips	
Sep 13 2009 	Fantastic - Loved It!!	We stayed at the Donatello for about 5 nights while touring San Francisco. The staff are friendly and it's a excellent location near union square. Staff are helpful in locating attractions and booking activities (see Sarah at the front desk). Breakfast isn't worth a look (only fruit and pastries IF you get there early - we got there at 7am). The beds are comfortable though and all in all as everyone says the location is what sells it.Tip: Friday afternoon complimentary wine and cheese is a timeshare sales pitch, don't waste your time if you aren't interested in buying timeshare.	
Sep 13 2009 	Amazing service and location for a great price.	Great value. The downtown location and the service were what you'd expect for a place charging double the price. The room had a mini-fridge, microwave, toaster, and mini-kitchen sink, in addition to the typical hotel amenities. The hotel staff were extremely courteous and helpful -- giving directions, making change for our street car/trolley adventures, holding our luggage after check out so we could explore the town in the afternoon before flying out.The only negative comment I could make is that is was loud at night, with traffic etc. You'd expect that at any downtown location, but I also expect that the newer hotels have insulated windows to reduce the noise.	
Sep 10 2009 	Fantastic staff and great Union Square location	We spent 4 days at the Donatello and loved it. A block or so from Union Square with tons of very good restaurants within walking distance. Staff, from front desk to bellmen to maids were all very friendly and helpful. Parking is $28 per day, so don't take a car - cable car and trolley car are both walking distance away.Large room with small refrigerator and microwave. Very comfortable bedding and flat screen TV. The restaurant in the hotel is pricey (as most San Francisco restaurants are), but very good food (and excellent service). We will definitely stay there again.	
Sep 10 2009 	Great Location	rooms very clean, friendly helpful staff, great location, I just think it is a little over priced, considering you have to pay for parking, we had to have 2 rooms for a party of 5.Breakfast was OK but not fab, on the day we checked out they were moving the breakfast area to the restaurant . you had a much better selection and more places to sit, an extra $7 per person.I would use this hotel again if there were only 4 of us.	
Sep 8 2009 	Amazing value for money	We stayed two nights in The Donatello in San Francisco. I choose this hotel mostly because of the good reviews and my high expectations have been excelled.The location is just amazing. It is near Union Square and from there you can get everywhere using the MUNI system. We walked to the The Embarcadero and even this was a very pleasant and not too long walk.The hotel is modern clean and the rooms are huge. And best of all it was a real bargain (just shop around online and you should find amazingly low prices).I would highly recommend this hotel, if you want to stay in San Francisco. I didn't find any shortcomings and I don't think that you can find a better package for the same price.	
Sep 6 2009 	Would love to come back every year !	This was our first visit to San Francisco and we had no idea what to expect. But we were thrilled and excited and impressed with everything we saw and experienced. The hotel was perfect and the staff was very helpful and friendly. Great location. We walked up Market Street to the Embarcadero and along there to Fisherman's Wharf. A long walk but we are used to that and thoroughly enjoyed it. Another day, we rented a car and drove down the Pacific Coast to Monterey and Carmel. Absolutely beautiful. We were able to park the car for the night at the hotel for a very reasonable charge. We also rented bikes and biked across the Golden Gate Bridge to Sausalito. Another really fun day. Far too much to do in just one trip. We'll have to come back and continue. Zero complaints from us.	
Sep 6 2009 	good location great room breakfast average	The rooms are large and comfortable. The service is excellent. Proximity to union square, shopping and public transport options is also helpful. Nice coffee in the rooms but the coffee at breakfast is suboptimal. Just go to starbucks.	
Sep 5 2009 	Wonderful location great value	There are lots of positive reviews of this centrally located 4 star hotel in San Francisco and here's another one. Booked via internet site and also confirmed on the phone and got a good deal £ 119 + tax for a studio room with king size bed and very large sofa bed. Room large by San Francisco standards (with smallish bathroom which was well equipped). Good city views from room and also from Club level at top of building where free hot drinks are available and there is a spa, sauna and fitness room. Staff all very friendly and helpful with good concierge service for booking restaurants etc. Location on Post Street and Mason is good, although Mason down to Market Street has its fair share of rather tacky tourist restaurants and stores.Stayed two nights and would happily have stayed longer to enjoy this great city.	
Sep 4 2009 	Great first time for the kids to see the great sights and sounds of San Francisco!	Our kids are 9 &amp; 7-years and we thought that they were old enough to appreciate the sights of this great city. Staying at the Donatello was a great experience and central to sights either walking or driving. Included in the price was parking (free in and out) which helped tremendously. The hotel amenities and room were superb. All in all a wonderful experience and looking foward to another visit to the Bay Area!	
Sep 3 2009 	We can't fault the Donatello	Booked the Donatello directly on their own website, we were doing a driving trip so had a rental car, and parking was important. We didn't want to pay as much to park the car, as the hotel room. We got the parking package, which included unlimited in-and-out valet parking. All the staff we had contact with were fantastic, very enthusiastic and helpful, and clearly enjoyed their jobs. The rooms was very spacious, and having the mini kitchen (complete with salt and pepper, cutlery, crockery, coffee machine, microwave and frig) was a real bonus. It's not often you stay in a hotel with a large couch and an easy chair in a studio room. And the bed was oh, so comfy. Great location, only one block from Union Square. Will definitely go back when we next holiday in San Francisco.	
Sep 2 2009 	Great service large comfortable room and excellent location!!	We really enjoyed our 3 nites at the Donatello. The hotel staff was excellent, the room was large and had a fridge and microwave, utensils and plates.We usually stay out on Lombard but decided to try this hotel and it was a great choice. We will definitely stay here again!!	
Sep 2 2009 	The Great Heat Escape	Living in Arizona, it is important for us desert rats to find a great get-away in the middle of the summer. We stayed at The Donatello for the weekend and had one of the best times of our lives. There was so much to see and do that we barely had time to rest....the Farmers Market at Fisherman's Wharf was UNBELIEVABLE!!!! The Muni system was the best for getting from point a to point b without any hassle....and the hotel staff were so helpful at finding us just the right places to eat, etc that they should be proud of themselves. I would recommend this Hotel to anyone, anytime. Thanks Trish &amp; Ed	
Aug 31 2009 	Great location - great hotel	Stayed at the Donatello for one week this summer. Travelled with 3 teenagers - had two rooms. Chose this property based on reviews on this site and was not disappointed.Rooms were large(even with pull out couch open) clean and well furnished. Beds were very comfy. Housekeeping was good, extra towels left automatically, no need to ask. Turn down service is a nice touch. Location is wonderful: near everything and a great variety of restaurants within walking distance. Hotel restaurant was very good as well.Exercise area small and equipment limited. Computer in lobby area nice touch but internet access was unbearably slow. Concierge was able to help us print our boarding passes for return flight. Area for continental breakfast is small. Hotel was changing over to a breakfast in the restaurant area to accomodate crowding and limited selection complaints. Seemed that there would be a fee associted with this. ($7) Did not check out this new choice, but you may want to clarify if you are expecting a free continental breakfastUsed valet service daily. Car was always brought promptly. Days when the parkers were busy and car took another minute or two, valets always acknowledged and apologized for delays.Would return to this propoert without hesitation	
Aug 31 2009 	San Francisco Treat	I always enjoy the location of the Donatello Hotel as well as the courtesy of the staff. I arrived early and to my delight was allowed access to my room; that was a treat as I had driven up from San Diego with my son in his truck. I was too tired to wait for the restaurant to open but the bar menu and happy hour drinks quickly had me feeling relaxed and comfortable. The next day the fun began as I explored the City from what is such an easy location to come and go from. This is my second time staying at the Donatello and I will be coming back again real soon!!	
Aug 30 2009 	Wonderful location friendly staff great accommodations	My husband and I own Shell Vacations Club timeshare points at the Donatello and use it for &quot;cooling off&quot; when our summers in the Sacramento Valley heat up. We love this place because the staff is extremely friendly and curteous and requests for extras are always met promptly. The location, one block off Union Square, is ideal for everthing, shopping, restaurants, theaters, you name it. The accommodations are very nice and include a small &quot;wet bar&quot; and microwave, comfortable sofa and chair. Enough said.	
Aug 28 2009 	LOVED it!	My boyfriend and I recently stayed at the Donatello and we can't say enough nice things about it. It was our first time to San Francisco and we booked the resort through Shell Vacations Club. (We are members.) The hotel is centrally located within walking distance of Union Square and Chinatown and within a 10 minute driving distance of Lombard Street, the Wharf and the Golden Gate Bridge. The room and the hotel were lovely. The room was tastefully decorated with nice colors and a number of windows, a large bed and a pullout couch. There was also a mini-kitchen in the room, with a microwave, small refridge, a sink, plates, cups and utinsels. The hotel staff was exceptional, - the valet, the concierge, the front desk employees, the cleaning crew, EVERYONE - were extremely nice and very helpful. I would recommend this hotel/resort to my family and friends. It was a wonderful experience.	
Aug 27 2009 	The Presidential view from the top	Snagged the Presidential Suite on the top floor when booking for myself, spouse and in-laws. The owner used to live there so it feels much more like home ... if your home was on the 14th floor a block away from Union Square. We had the luxury of a living room, corner dining room with great views, entry hall and down the corridor the master bedroom (en suite) and second bedroom (small bathroom across the hall). Very spacious, with the bonus of decent sound insulation; felt like we could each have our own space. Flat screen TVs in 3 rooms, microwave and fridge. The front desk staff were helpful. Some of our party took advantage of the exercise room and breakfast up in the club room. We even succeeded in getting the cleaning staff to leave our towels when requested; every single place I've been to so far that puts those 'Save Our Planet' signs in the bathroom replaces your towels no matter what.Street parking, even to drop our luggage off, was tough to impossible, but after that we ditched the rental car thank goodness.	
Aug 26 2009 	Best Hotel in San Francisco	The staff is superb and the location is the best, one block to Union Square and close to the BART station. The breakfast is wonderful and the complimentary wine and cheese on Friday is GREAT!!Love to visit again and again.	
Aug 26 2009 	Totally Terrific Experience!!!	From the moment we checked and until we left, this hotel made us feel welcome, comfortable, cared for and as if we were long-time gracious friends. It started with the Desk Clerk who checked us in and continued until the Bell Captain hailed a cab for us at departure.Our room was spacious. It provided a most comfortable bed as well as ample room to read and relax. The wet bar, microwave and refrigerator enabled us to snack in the room and have a glass of chilled wine before dinner. We were fortunate to have a room with a landscaped terrace.The roof-top club, which provided a Continental Breakfast daily was convenient and casual. Full concierge services were also available there as well as in the lobby. Knowledgeable staff provide terrific recommendations and guidence.Not to be forgotten, the hotel is convenient to theaters and to all that the Union Square area offers.The restaurant, which is adjacent to, but not part of the hotel was excellent. We enjoyed two first rate meals that, for San Francisco, were well priced. Their bar had an almost &quot;Cheers-like&quot; atmosphere. Very pleasant --- and they mixed an outstanding drink.We'll say it again . . . our stay at the Donatello provided us with a Totally Terrific Experience!!!	
Aug 25 2009 	Wonderful location and very heplful staff	Can't say enough good things about our stay at the Donatello. The location is absolutely perfect. Every mode of transportation is within a few blocks walk. Our room was well taken care of with turn down bed service every evening with our little chocolate goodies. Every concierge at the hotel was so knowledgeable and you never felt hurried. I would highly recommend.	
Aug 25 2009 	Another great trip to SFO	There are a number of great places to stay in SFO but being in close proximity to Union Square is important to be close to the action and all the great dining. The Donatello Hotel in SFO is in a great location being one block removed from the square so a little bit away from the crowds and trolley cars but close enough you can be anywhere in the downtown within 10-15 minutes. The facility is well appointed and the rooms are nicely appointed and very spacious. Overall a great place to stay in SFO to be near the many activities and shopping.	
Aug 25 2009	Great hotel - amazing location!!	Such a great hotel. located just off union square. i stayed in a hotel on union square another time and it was nowhere near as good as the donatello. when you walk in the lobby is small but its typical of a boutique city hotel. the rooms are great though. theres so much space and you have a fridge and little kitchen area. The other hotel i stayed in on union square was very small. barely enough room for our suitcase in the room. the donatello would have very big rooms for a city hotel. staff are friendly. i would definitely stay here again!!!	
Aug 25 2009 	Helpful and friendly staff.	Picked Hotel by reading reviews and checking on rooms available in the area of the Orpheum Theater. We arrived earlier than the listed ck-in time, but the gentleman behind the desk had our information and checked us in quickly suggesting we talk to the conciere for any questions we had regarding our activities during our short stay. The lady was friendly and gave us valuable info re getting around the City and areas that might be questionable at nitetime. Our room was large and very clean with access to fresh air and a great shower.	
Aug 23 2009 	Our favorite place to stay in San Francisco.	We've stayed at the Donatello several time. Medium-size hotel with great ambience and overall comfort. Staff try to make you feel you are their honored guests. One block from Union Square, close to cable cars, art galleries. If you want to purchase pastries at the Club Room be sure to go before 9 a.m.!	
Aug 22 2009 	Awesome Donatello resort	Aloha, i checked in late and was treated wonderfully, all my request were met.I loved the rooms, very cozy and so close to union square, cable cars, bart.Found the restaurants room service excellent, the spa and exercise room very nice as well as the business center adequate. The staff was wonderful, from the front desk to housekeeping, and the valets. Everyone should be sure to go all the way down power street and go into the shooping center to find a fantastic grocery store, with lots of goodies. also restaurant with resonable priced menus...	
Aug 21 2009 	Great Location and excellent service	Although this hotel is in a great location and the service was excellent, we stayed in the presidential suite which required a little work. The bathrooms need a redo, including the plumbing fixtures. The second bedroom had a mildew odor. Everyone was very pleasant except one concierge was not as knowledgeable as she could have been. All in all a verygood choice.	
Aug 21 2009 	Finally a comfortable Bed!!	This is the first night after many nights sleeping in rock hard hotel beds that could have passed for doors, that I finally got a good night sleep. The room was very clean, updated, with a cool view of the city below.	
Aug 19 2009 	Personal Service with a Smile - Welcome Home!	Just returned from a business trip to the Bay area where I had another delightful stay, albeit for only one night this time, at the Donatello. Jesus, Manuel, Mark, and Rolando welcomed me back warmly even though it had been a year since my last stay: &quot;Welcome home!&quot; As always, the room, the breakfast, and the customer service were just tops. (Just wish they could have imparted their hospitable service to the rowdies out on the street who were beeping car horns and screaming late at night!)Check out all the historical artifacts there - the marble, Belgian tapestry, and the ceiling in the lobby. There's a blurb about it in the guest info book in the room.	
Aug 19 2009 	Very friendly staff and a great location.	We only stayed one night and everything was great. The staff was friendly and helpful. The room was quiet, clean and comfortable. The location is only one block from Union Square. This was a shopping trip and all of the stores were within walking distance. We took the Cable Car down to Pier 39 and enjoyed an excellent dinner. We will be back to this resort.	
Aug 18 2009 	Close to Union Sq 	Located quite close to Union Square, the Bart Station and other forms of transport and restaurants. It was our first destination in the USA and were so happy with our choice, we stayed there again on our stopover on the home. While the decor not our personal choice, it was elegant and well maintained. The mini-kitchenette was a useful, non standard feature in hotels in the USA/Canada. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The Friday afternoon gathering for guests a very nice feature.	
Aug 18 2009 	Wonderful hotel at a wonderful price.	4 of us recently stayed at the Donatello in S.F. I thought this hotel was a real gem.The price was good especially for the local and the wonderful amenities.This boutique style hotel has very comfortable and spacious rooms and bathrooms.The king size bed was a treat with its high thread count sheets. The breakfasts were good and served in their attractive club/terrace area.The staff was courteous and helpful.I like that it was smaller size hotel -not with hundreds of rooms.The best stay of our 10 day vacation.	
Aug 17 2009 	Central location. Excellent friendly service.	We stayed 4 nights in the Donatello recently. The location is central - very convenient to Union Sq shops and city transport. Front desk and concierge were pleasant and helpful. We had to move room as a batchelor party arrived to 2 rooms opposite our original room. Our request to move room was dealt with quickly and effeciently without any fuss. The rooms are a good size and were spotlessly clean. One area that could be improved was breakfast- very sweet cakes, a plain option would be good. Nice club / lounge with city views, where you can read or enjoy complimentary tea or coffee. I would certainly return there again if travelling to San Fran.	
Aug 17 2009 	Stay nowhere else but at The Donatello	I have stayed here now 3 times and we absolutely loved it! from the location so close to Union Square and all public transportation, to the comfortable and large rooms with microwave and refrigerator, etc. to the staff's friendliness and helpfullness!I will always return here and I have nothing negative to say.Wish I could have stayed longer and used the upstairs gym and spa! Oh well next time!	
Aug 17 2009 	Great hotel great price great location	The Donatello is located near Union Square (shopping district) and Powell Street station, making it easy to get to public transportation. Chinatown is an easy walk from the hotel. We really enjoyed our 5-night stay here. The room was very spacious, with a nice layout that made it comfortable for us and our two 18+ children to share the room. Bed was great, towels were very nice and the room was very clean. Wireless Internet connection was very good. We had a refrigerator, microwave, coffee maker with a sink in the kitchen area, and there were dishes, silverware, glasses provided. The hotel staff couldn't have been nicer or more helpful. The only negative was that the plumbing was a bit noisy. However, it was certainly tolerable, and the hotel was a great value. I'd definitely stay here again.	
Aug 17 2009 	Enjoyed Every Minute	All the good things said about this property are true, you could not meet a nicer group of people. Every employee we met was efficient and service oriented. We had a fifth floor terrace room and actually got to enjoy it a few days. I was concerned about noise after reading some other reviews and I am happy to say that other than emergency vehicles we never heard a thing. The so called breakfast is really only good for the beverages and the fruit, but the hot drinks available 24hours were greatly appreciated at the end of the day when I was freezing. It was only in the high 50's during the day and windy, so by the time evening came I was ready for some warmth. We spent alot of time in the Wharf area doing tours etc, so I thought maybe staying in that area would have been a better idea. Now that I think about it it was good to take the public transit to see other areas of the city and we had some great food around the hotel. Biscuits and Blues is next door to the hotel, good food and a great Blues show. I would definitely recommend this hotel for a service and value oriented stay.	
Aug 15 2009	A wonderful hotel	We booked this hotel based on the great reviews it received on tripadvisor, and we were not disappointed one bit. The location is within walking distance of many restaurants, shops, and means of public transportation. The staff are friendly, courteous, and extremely helpful. Special kudos to Sarah, the concierge! The room was clean and bright, and the price is quite reasonable for downtown in a major city. We would definitely stay there again.	
Aug 14 2009 	A great base for our San Francisco vacation	The Donatello has a lot going for it. It is in an area near to Union Square and the transit hub. The staff were all friendly and willing to go out of their way to make your stay enjoyable. The room was a good size and very clean. The continental breakfast was very nice but sometimes the area got a little too crowded. The only negative I can mention was the poor ventilation in the bathroom.	
Aug 12 2009 	Fabulous people location rooms and big bang for the buck.	I love this hotel! I was in town to assist my daughter with a surgery so I was not expecting a pleasant stay. I was also nervous to be in the Union Square part of town because I was afraid of dirt, noise, etc. I spent 6 nights there. Much to my surprise, the hotel was quiet, extremely well run, the room clean and in good shape and very large compared to other, pricier rooms in SF. There was a great deal of storage space you also don't see in the hotels on the Wharf. Mark and all the front desk folks were very kind and asked about my daughter when I got back to the hotel at night. The valet parking was exceptional. I had to leave the hotel at 5:30 the morning of surgery and the car was right there as I had requested. The front desk even gives you little maps with your key card to help find your way around town which was invaluable. The free continental breakfast was a bit light on healthy fare, but it was as advertized. The Club floor itself is an elegant touch and I chose the hotel because it had a work out facility, which was fine. The bed and pillow were large, comfortable and clean. There were large window in the room you could actually open for air. I was hugely impressed with the Donatello and would go back in a heartbeat. I was sorry I did not get to try the food but the restaurant looked very romantic when i went to investigate.	
Aug 11 2009 	Perfect stay for a perfect vacation	We traveled with our two older teenage children and they had their own room which was a vacation within a vacation. I've been to San Francisco 4 times and this was my best stay yet. Yes it was a little noisy, but it's a city. If I wanted quiet I would have gone to the country. The location was fantastic. One block from the trolley and the bus. Great restaurants within walking distance. The room was large, bright and airy. The bathroom was large enough and everything was spotless. The beds were very comfortable and according to my children, so was the sleeper sofa. The staff was incredibly helpful. We didn't eat the breakfast because as I said, we traveled with teenagers who think waking up at 10am. is early and really, I'm in San Francisco, why would I eat a continental hotel breakfast anyway. Just the fact that it was included in the room price is pretty unusual for a hotel in a major city. My only complaint were the pillows. There could have been a few more and much firmer. Overall, it was a fantastic vacation at a wonderful hotel.	
Aug 10 2009 	Nice room - Things could be better though!	Pros:*Spacious Room*Fridge, toaster, microwave, coffee pot - VERY convenient!!*Good Storage*Clean!!*Excellent location to Union Square and shopping*concierge VERY helpful - asked if we wanted to listen to a timeshare pitch BUT was NOT pushy when we said no.*Besides credit card issue (see below), the staff were all VERY friendly and happy to answer any questions.*Sound wasn't an issue - I mean, yes, you can hear traffic below, but I'm really not sure you can avoid that in SF and it wasn't as bad as some other hotels we've stayed at before.Cons:*HORRIBLE shower - felt like I was in a pressure washer for a shower.*breakfast - coffee, tea, OJ and pastries. A couple baby apples and a few oranges in a bowl. Ours included the breakfast but there was also a sign that said a charge of $4 - for free I can't knock it - but if you want more than muffins or donuts, it's not going to happen.*Internet only worked some of the time in the room. Have to go to the club level to get good service.*Issue with credit card - each person we spoke to told us a different thing that was being held for incidentals/room charges...very confusing, and we stay in hotels A LOT and have never had such a bizarre experience.Overall - would we stay here again? Maybe. We're still waiting for the credit card issues to be worked out, I guess it depends if things are really resolved. If they are, probably - I can chalk up the issue to just a glitch or misunderstanding or mistake. If not, I'd try somewhere else - there are so many hotels in the City to try.	
Aug 9 2009 	Room out dated	My husband and I along with our teenage son booked the&quot; Presidential Suite&quot; . It was large, like an apartment, with a dining room and a living room, but no kitchen, two large bedrooms and two baths. The decor was very out dated, but comfortable. The bathrooms were very small, dingy and seemed like they didn't belong, in proportion to the rest of the suite, more like they belonged in motel six. The towels were substandarderd,as were the shampoos and soaps. It should have been a great room, but really needed up-dating!	
Aug 8 2009 	Best hotel I've been to in San Francisco.	I have been to numerous Hotels in San Francisco including some of the very pricey hotels located directly in Union Square, and this hotel was by far the nicest. It is really a great deal. The rooms are very modern,clean, and spacious. The bed was very comfortable. I slept very well. There is also a sofa bed that some members of our party slept on, and they said that was pretty comfortable as well. The windows are large, so the view is good. There is also a refrigerator, microwave, toaster, and coffee machine in the room. The front desk staff members are very friendly. It location is just a couple of blocks from Union Square. There is also a Walgreens nearby in case you need anything in a rush. I read reviews on this hotel before I booked it, and some complain about noise. Well, San Francisco is always noisy. It is a city so there is always something going on, and there are always sirens. There is a nightclub across the street from the hotel which does have a little bit of noise but it is not really noticeable or unbearable. I'd say that the room was pretty quiet compared to rooms I've stayed in elsewhere. The only negative is that the continental breakfast is $4.00 for 2 pastries and a fruit. However, one can't really complain when the rooms are so wonderful for such a great price. And they do offer free hot chocolate, coffee, and tea which is great. GREAT GREAT GREAT HOTEL! Our stay was very enjoyable.	
Aug 2 2009 	Perfect hotel with great location and service	We stayed at the Donatello for one week at the start of July and we were very impressed. The room was large, very clean and well equipped. Staff were very attentive and helpful. Having breakfast included was a bonus. We would recommend this hotel for anybody travelling with young kids.	
Aug 2 2009 	Nice Room - But a bit noisy	ROOM 502: Large bed. Cool room. Small bath. Steamy mirror. Poor shower. No shower gel. Coffee machine available (no tea), plus fridge, microwave and toaster. Big TV. Poor lighting. Noisy city at night. SERVICES: Conceirge extremely helpful with booking tours. Breakfast choice was poor as well as the crowded seating area. AREA: Cable cars are slow with huge queues. Bus tours available (until 5pm) to Fishermans Wharf then on to Alcatraz and access towards Golden Gate Bridge. Sonoma wine country tour is worthwhile.I WOULD RECOMMEND STAYING IN A HOTEL NEAR FISHERMAN'S WHARF.	
Aug 2 2009 	Great value great staff	We stayed in the Donatello for 4 nights at the start of a holiday in California. A great hotel, good sized rooms, friendly staff and good value. Within easy walking distance of Union Square. I would certanly have no hesitation in recommending this hotel.	
Jul 29 2009 	Good Times	The hotel staff was wonderful and had a great sense of humor! We were contacted by the concierge within a few hours of checking, they wanted to find out how they could help us during our stay. It was located in a central area and close to so much. The rooms felt welcoming and comfortable. We had enough room for my sister-in-law to drop in and spend the night. The bathrooms show the hotels age but were clean and well stocked. I did like that we were provided a bathrobe. We only were there two nights and it was quite a nice stay. The continental breakfast was light but there. I loved that there was FREE wireless internet in the rooms! Though the 30 some odd dollars for parking was no fun the hotel was close enough to walk to get public transit so we did not have to pay more for parking.	
Jul 29 2009 	Great Locationfriendly stafflarge room with full kitchen	We loved this hotel, near Union Square,easy to get to any kind of shops and restaurants.Big room with kitchen allowed us to have meals with a lot of confort!In the top floor we enjoyed a nice room with magazines, soft drinks and juices (free).Spotless clean.	
Jul 28 2009 	A Bad Start Nicely Handled	Booked a room at the Donatello based upon nice reviews here on TripAdvisor. Walked in and was told that the hotel was oversold (guess the economy isn't hurting everywhere). To their credit, we were comped a room over at their sister hotel; the Intercontinental. They handled the situation very nicely, and provided a reference person to talk to and a letter for us to provide to that person verifying the freebie. The Intercontinental handled the other end very graciously, and we were provided with a very nice room on the 24th floor. While we were disappointed with the situation, we were very impressed with the result, and we would certainly book another room at either hotel. Side note: The breakfast downstairs at the Intercontinental is very good, and its' location at the base of Mission Street is perfect for accessing various sites in the city.	
Jul 28 2009 	Great room; helpful friendly staff; and good rates	5 night stay with the family to attend a conference. Everything in the room worked as it should; the bed and the pullout were comfortable; and there was plenty of shelving and storage space for our assorted gear. Our room looked almost exactly like the one on their website. Breakfast room is very relaxing but get there early or the best fruits will be gone. It even a wrap-around balcony for the hard-core smokers.... We would definitely stay there again.	
Jul 26 2009 	Great Sized Room - Great Location!	We stayed three weeknights in The Donatello on family vacation with two teenagers. The room was great size for the four of us. We read the tips on the pullout couch and was semi-worried going in - but it was perfect! The room rate was reasonable and the location is the best - Union Square. So much walkable and accessible nearby.The service was top notch and front desk very helpful and friendly. The only knock was the workout room - very subpar. One treadmill and bike won't cut it at a major hotel property. Did find an outstanding three mile run downtown through Union Square area - excellent! The breakfast area was also crowded and was confusing if it was complimentary or you needed to pay. Didn't matter as two of the best breakfast places are very close and walkable - Dottie's and Crepes.Overall - very favorable stay and would recommend to friends!	
Jul 26 2009 	Great value in the greatest city!	Close to Union Square shopping and the China Town culture, the Donatello Hotel is a great value in San Francisco! A good restaurant, Happy Hour, piano music in the Lobby and a knowledgeable, exceptional staff! Won't stay anywhere else!	
Jul 22 2009 	Lovely room with a great mattress	I spent 2 nights in the Donatello recently and I highly recommend it. The room was tastefully decorated and comfortable with a nice sofa,table and lounge chair. The mattress was really comfortable. I have a Sleep Number Bed at home so I am very particular. I slept very well. I especially liked that I could open the window to the outside and enjoy the cool San Francisco night. The hotel is in walking distance of several restaurants if you choose to not partake in the hotel's,(I did not). Upscale shopping is very near in Union Square. Close to BART and public transportation. I will return to the Donatello. The staff was welcoming and housekeeping was very friendly. A very nice hotel.	
Jul 19 2009 	Great hotel great location	Only stayed for one night but was really impressed with the hotel, large rooms, friendly &amp; helpful staff. Only complaint was the spa area. The hot tub was only large enough to fit 2-4 people (which would be cramped then). Was looking forward to a soak to relax after a day of shopping/sightseeing but it just wasnt possible given the amount of people waiting to use. Sauna was the same, it wasnt turned on (takes 20mins to heat up) and was large enough for 2/3 people only.although in fairness to the hotel everything else was really good. Located just off Union Square so was really handy for good shopping/food/transport.Staff were very friendly and when i arrived back with my girlfriend after a day of shopping/sightseeing it was a really nice touch to find the curtains drawn and lamps on, with after dinner mints on the bedside. A really easy thing to do but a really nice touch from the staff.Room had a coffee machine, fridge, microwave, cutlerey (basically everything you need if your stay was longer and you fancied saving a few dollars by making lunch in the room).	
Jul 14 2009 	Convenient	Our two day stay at the Donatello in Union Square was wonderful. Chinatown was just a few blocks away as were two of the cable car routes. We enjoyed walking around and found wonderful places to eat and drink. The staff were very helpful and our room was located on a quiet side street so we could rest well in the afternoon and evening.	
Jul 11 2009 	Quality Hotel	We stay at the Donatello at least five times a year. The rooms are spacious, clean and comfortable. The service is outstanding. The Donatello is our first choice if we are staying in downtown San Francisco.	
Jul 10 2009 	Great C0mbination of price service and amenities	My wife and i make regular treks to SF for a change of pace and have tried out dozens of hotels over the years. The Don fits us best. One block to Union Square, nice clean room with everything you expect but hardly ever get ... comfy king-sized bed (better than home!), clean room with nice furnishings, flat screen, dvd player, a little boom box, fridge, safe, coffee machine or Club room in the am for complimentary coffee, parking for 20 bucks if you ask for the combo package. What else? Little stuff like a robe, ironing board, hair dryer, queen-sized pull out. And the windows open, at least in our room, so you don't feel like you're in a hermetically sealed cage. And the service was top rate. We're going back.	
Jul 10 2009 	Excellent location for a cozy/romantic getaway!	My girlfriend and I have stayed at The Donatello several times and enjoy its excellent central location in Union Square, within walking distance to the Starlite Night Club, several varieties of restaurants, trolley service etc. etc. The hotel's 2nd floor bar &amp; lounge is very cozy/romantic with jazz singer &amp; pianist to complete the setting. Hotel staff have always been very service oriented and no problem with the cozy, clean rooms.	
Jul 10 2009 	Our special place	Five years ago we spent our honeymoon at the Donatello and fell in love with it. Since we live in Sacramento, we use it for our get away place to the city. We've found our favorite restaurants within walking distance. The staff is always pleasant. The lounge on the top floor is always a comfortable spot to go. After a nite at the theatre or Giants game we love to go to the 2nd floor lounge for a drink and some pleasant live music.	
Jul 10 2009 	Great Location	The hotel is within walking distance to Union Square &amp; public transportation. Staff was friendly &amp; helpful. The hotel room was large &amp; came with a microwave, minifridge, &amp; dishes.Room was a little dated &amp; the carpet could use a cleaning.	
Jul 9 2009 	Beautiful hotel. Excellent service	We stayed here as Shell Vacation members. Their customer service is excellent. The front desk and bell caption service was very helpful. Room service was great with very good prices. Dinner at the Italian Restaurant at the hotel was 1st class. We will definitely stay here again. Location was perfect to take public transportation anywhere.	
Jul 7 2009 	A comfortable and enjoyable stay with great top-floor Concierges!	I spent 9 comfortable days at the Donatello while my partner was in SF at a conference, and found the rooms spacious and comfortable. They look somewhat dated, but one warms to that, and the convenience of having the space and a fridge and kitchen area is appreciated.Breakfast was limited but pleasant, not least for the opportunity to chat and pick the brains of the wonderful concierges - Poldi and Peter. They were a mine of information, and have extensive files of the same to hand to assist you in your sight-seeing and restaurant booking!Don't bother with the hotel restaurant - very average - go across the road to Fino's for good Italian food! (And don't forget the 'Cheesecake Factory' at Macey's - what a find!).	
Jul 7 2009 	Fantastic hotel with exceptionally large rooms	I have stayed at the Donatello many times in the last several years. I am always impressed by the courtesy of the staff, the impeccable cleanliness of the rooms and the fabulous location (right near union square). The rooms are very large (approx. 425 sq. feet I believe) and they have nice amenities (microwave, mini-fridge, coffee maker, sink and dishes). The Club room is a nice place to have a cup of coffee or wine and relax also. It's a lovely hotel that I would highly recommend to anyone who is seeking a friendly, professional atmosphere and an attention to detail. The value/quality for the price is exceptional also.	
Jul 5 2009 	Great hotel great staff...	We thought this was a fantastic hotel. We really enjoyed the Friday night wine tasting.. The staff was very helpful in offering tips on navigating the city.	
Jul 3 2009 	Nice hotel and with friendly staff and comfortable rooms.	The Donatello for the most part met my expectations during my five night stay.After researching sites like Trip Advisor and finding an excellent rate at this hotel, I decided to give the Donatello a try. The rooms were quite large with ample space to spread out. The queen-sized bed was comfortable. I was fortunate enough to get a corner room and experienced minimal hallway traffic and noise. The room's layout and cleanliness were good but the quality of furniture and lighting seemed below average for this level of hotel class. Since I was on the fifth floor, there was also a fair amount of street noise. The bathroom was a pleasant surprise with a convenient layout, plenty of counter top space and clean towels. Overall feeling of cleanliness was extremely high similar to what one can find at a five or six star hotel.The continental breakfast was basic but good. Sliced bread, bagels, donuts and pastries and fresh fruit were available. Coffee was quite good and served hot. Every morning, the tiny breakfast room and outside deck areas were crowded with as many guests as it can hold. The fitness center is across from the breakfast room and small with one treadmill, cycling machine and some free weights.The Donatello is little more than one block away from Union Square and about five blocks from the trolley car station. During the day, the area around the hotel seems to be relatively safe. Many nights walking back to the hotel was uneventful with a decent amount of people and cars still going through the area. Most memorable was the friendliness of the hotel staff. They were very approachable and helpful and keen on making your stay a pleasant one. Overall the service was highly commendable with generously-sized and comfortable rooms. The hotel is unpretentious and well-kept. The Donatello can offer tremendous value when staying in San Francisco.	
Jul 2 2009 	great hotel	Great location with good size rooms, friendly service, great value for the money.	
Jul 1 2009 	Great Stay!	I stayed at this hotel for only one night, but wish I could have stayed longer. The value for the price is excellent. I traveled with my husband and my brother and the room was spacious enough to accommodate all three of us. The location could not have been better, a short walk to Union Square and the cable car lines. Our room was very clean (the bathroom was a bit dated, but clean). We stayed on the fifth floor and were not bothered by any city noise. I would highly recommended staying at the Donatello!	
Jun 22 2009 	Fantastic hotel and location!	The Donatello was a great place to stay! The rooms were very clean and were very spacious! We had great service from the concierge, Carlos, he was great! The bed was really comfortable and we had no street noise in our room! And the location was excellent. The trolley stop is only 1 block away and it gets you right to Fisherman's Wharf and Lombard Street. And it's fun to ride! We would definitely stay here again!	
Jun 20 2009 	Our stay at The Donatello Hotel was one of the most memorable experiences of our trip.	The room was huge, lots of storage space, very neat and clean. We were pleasantly surprised at how nice the hotel was, perfect location, easy in and out. The concierge was very helpful, she made reservations for us for dinner and for some of the attactions, no additional fees. The happy hour was always the perfect way to the end of a wonderful sightseeing day. All of the hotel staff made us feel very welcomed. The restaurant was great. The waitstaff were very attentive.	
Jun 19 2009 	Great accomodation	Great central location, Large modern rooms, good service.will stay again.	
Jun 18 2009 	A beautiful and convenient downtown hotel.	We had a great stay at the Donatello. The concierge was most helpful, the room was clean and more than adequate. It is easy to get to tourist sites, financial centers, Union Square and public transit from the location.	
Jun 17 2009 	Great Hotel	Large, comfortable rooms. Great location. Everyone in our group of nine loved this hotel. We would definitely stay here again.	
Jun 17 2009 	I couldn't have asked for more	Travelling with a 4 year old is never easy and one of the things we were looking for when planning to goto San Francisco was easy access to all the city has to offer without a car. The Donatello is literally 1 block away from Union Square where you can hop on and off the trolleys to Fisherman's Warf. The rooms at the Donatello are getting a little dated, especially in the bathrooms, but there was nothing gross about it. The living area was very spacious for the 3 of us and the noise level (floor 9 in front of the elevator) was actually quite minimal. The front desk staff were courteous and helpful and made us feel very welcome. The only less than ideal part of the hotel is the small breakfast area and the very limited food inluded in the continental breakfast (just an assortment of muffins and donuts). We ended up taking the food back to our rooms. Overall the it served as the perfect base of operations for our 5 day trip and for $99/night, this was the best bang for the buck.	
Jun 16 2009	Perfect in every way.	Hotel is centrally located, just a block away from Union Square and easy access to public transportation, which was important, as it made it easy to move around. I was travelling with my 13 year old grandson, and everyone at the Donatello made us feel right at home from the minute we arrived until our departure. Staff is very friendly and knowledgeable of the city and attractions. Rooms are very spacious, clean and well appointed. Beds are VERY comfortable. Breakfast (continental) was included and very good. High Speed internet was offered and free. Will definitely stay there again.	
Jun 16 2009 	Excellent place to stay with a staff that takes care of you.	The staff was the greatest. I travel a lot in my line of business and I am generally alone. The Donatello staff ensured me that my stay would be great and it was. From Mark at the from desk, to room service and even the parking attendant made sure that my every need was taken care of . I have stayed in other resort hotels in San Francisco, but found this one and its staff great. As a solo traveler for business I was ensured by the staff that my stay would be great and it was. A big thank you to all of the housekeeping staff, the room was cleaned and fresh everyday. Again to Mark and the rest of the staff a big thank for the amazing experience. I will be back more often.	
Jun 16 2009 	Love This Hotel	Hotel staff were very accomodating and efficient. The suites were beautifully furnished and super clean-quite upscale and modern. Boutique style hotel right in the middle of terrific shopping and restaurants to walk to. Numerous art galleries all around. Easy access to the cable cars and tour buses. The consierge was extremely helpful the valet parking were top notch and very speedy to take our luggage and car. Never had such a fast and uncomplicated check in. Entrance very classy with marble and wood. The best was an Italian restaurant on the 2nd floor and a cosy piano bar.You must stay there it was a real treat to be so taken care of.next time I will plan to stay longer and take advantage of the spa and fitness areas	
Jun 13 2009 	Perfect Place to stay in San Fran	Very large clean and modern rooms. Great value in superb central location. You're only a short hop from union sq and all the shopping etc. You're also very close to the trolleys that head up to the wharf.The breakfast is not really worth bothering with but there are some great places near by.We will return	
Jun 9 2009 	spacious clean room good location	Stayed here for 5 nights. Room was very clean, staff courteous. The amenities are great - it's spacious, almost like a studio suite. The microwave, sink, plates and mini fridge (not minibar!) let you do a bit of in-room cuisine, which saves on cost and lets you control more of what you eat (for the health-conscious). TV gets a ton of movie channels, wireless internet is free and there's a little desk for your laptop.Room gets street noise - especially thursday and friday night - people on the streets below were partying pretty loud.Didn't try the continental breakfast, but it's part of the amenities.This is a great deal. I'd stay here again if I traveled back to San Francisco.	
Jun 9 2009 	Great location walking distance to Chinatown and Fisherman's Wharf	We didn't spend a lot of time in the hotel because we were out sightseeing a lot, but the fact that it had a fridge and small kitchen area was impressive. We didn't need to use our car to get to all the places we wanted to go. Overall, a great value.	
Jun 8 2009 	Definitely a great place to stay	Rooms were huge, front desk clerk Jesus......AMAZING, service impecable, clean, great price, great location, and for my honeymoon......VERY MEMORABLE, THANKS DONATELLO!!!!!!!!!!!!!	
Jun 8 2009 	great hotel and great value	A great hotel in a great location. Very good value. Our room had an outdoor terrace which was fantastic (only some rooms have this). I would stay there again if going to San Francisco.	
Jun 5 2009 	Fantastic hotel	Our stay at the Donatello from May 23-28 was truly wonderful! The hotel staff were pleasant, efficient and friendly. The hotel room was spacious, homey and well equipped.Internet was fast and free.The hotel is centrally located, just a short walk to Union Square-the transportation center, shops and restaurants.It is a gem. We intend to stay in Donatello whenever we go to San Francisco.	
Jun 3 2009 	a steal for the price	This was one of the nicest hotels I have ever stayed in. I was satisfied in every way. Great location, could walk everywhere in San Fransisco and it was in a great upscale area. The staff was very pleasant, room was large, clean, well equipped and very comfortable. It felt very upscale. The concierge gave us some great tips on Napa and places to eat in the city. I would most defintely recommend this hotel.	
Jun 3 2009 	Great Central Location Spacious and Reasonably Priced!	We were 2 adults with our 2 &quot;20 something&quot; kids on a family vacation for 5 days. Read a lot of nice reviews here and went for it. Requested room away from street and got what we wanted. Service was wonderful and quick for any request we made. We were within walking to all major shopping, nice resturants, and street cars. It was much nicer staying downtown instead of in commercialized Wharf area. Room were VERY spacious and clean and nice furnishings. Shower head was the only complaint. Bathroom was clean, but a little dated. Would stay here again any time we visit.	
Jun 3 2009 	An excellent hotel close to Union Square	We ( coming from Switzerland) had been mooving our son from Tennessee to San Francisco,and we had been staying for a month in the Donatello. We had been absolutely satisfied. First of all a very warm reception has been given to us. The room had been spacious and very nice, and it had always been spotlessly clean.The hotel has also a nice bar an a very good restaurant. We enjoyed our stay so much and we absolutely recommend this hotel.	
Jun 2 2009 	Quality services - value for money	It is a nice hotel at the very center of the city (close to Union square), easy to approach, close to the commercial center (Union square) and to all main means of city transport. The services provided to us were very good. The hotel staff was very prompt to serve us well and immediately. The room, the WC (and the beds) were big and continuously kept very clean. The price of the room was very good. Many fittness services were provided free of charge. The &quot;continental&quot; breakfast, which was also included in the room price, was not very rich but acceptable. The room (&quot;Club&quot;) in which the breakfast was provided (self-service) was rather small, but we never experienced any problem in finding a table.In general the value for money of this hotel is very high.	
Jun 2 2009 	Best Value Hotel in the US	We recently stayed 2 nights in the Donatello whilst on our honeymoon in the US.  We booked the Donatello based on previous trip advisor reviews and it lived up to the reputation.  The hotel is excellent, rooms are large, comfortable and well furnished with sofa/bed, plasma tv, fridge, coffee, kitchen sink, plates and cutlery.  Because we were on our honeymoon we were upgraded to a balcony room and given complimentary champagne upon arrival.  Jesus, along with all the staff at reception did everything they could to make us feel comfortable and welcome at this hotel.  Location is excellent just 1 block back from Union Square and so close to everything.  Free internet computer in the lobby for those without a laptop is great also.  We would definately recommend this hotel.	
Jun 1 2009 	The Donatello - Great Hotel!	We are Shell Resort Elite owners (from New Jersey) and have been to several Shell resorts and upscale destinations. We are regulars at The Donatello whenever we are in San Francisco. This hotel is not the most posh but for the location, comfort, amenities, and the super friendly, courteous staff, this hotel ranks up there. As soon as we walked in, the front desk welcomed us warmly. Our room was not ready because we got in early. So we went out for a quick lunch and when we returned our room was all ready with our luggage inside. We were given a room in the upper floor so we did not hear the city noise. The rooms and the hallways though could use an upgrade to make this hotel really outstanding. Their concierge staff has been superb and accommodating. Morgan worked with us on our dining tastes and she hit a 'home run' on every recommendation. The housekeeping staff always smiled and greeted us. The hotel is in Union Square right by the theater district and there are lots of galleries to see. The cable car, shops, restaurants, and a nice mall are all walking distance. This is a hotel that should be on everyone's list. Highly recommended!	
May 31 2009 	A gem in the midst of Union Square!!	The Donatello will far exceed your expectations. The rooms are large for San Francisco, clean and classy. The decor is trendy and the beds &amp; linens are super cozy. From the moment you walk in, the staff at the Donatello seems eager to welcome you and to make your stay and visit to the City amazing. Would definitely stay there again!!	
May 27 2009 	Five Star Service In The Heart Of San Francisco	If you want to be pampered with the utmost kindness, courtesy and caring assistance, make the Donatello your home away from home while in San Francisco. The staff - Moises, Jesus, Ed, Romie, Joe, Tony, and Ed (along with everyone else) - is the most accommodating, knowledgeable and cheerful group of people we have ever met. They went above and beyond with every request we had -- from telling us about great places to dine to securing tickets for our two-day Open Top sightseeing bus to arranging for our transportation to/from Napa and to the airport. The accommodations were clean, comfortable and quiet. Yes, quiet -- in downtown San Francisco just steps from Union Square and thousands of people. Rooms were equipped with a fridge, small micro and coffee maker. Twice we phoned the desk for service and twice someone appeared at our door within a minute or two. Unlike others who registered some disappointment about the continental breakfast, we were quite pleased -- fresh pastries, fruit and juice; robust coffees and several teas; hot instant cereal; and daily newspapers offered in a cozy library/den setting with a fireplace and outdoor access. We can't wait to return!	
May 26 2009 	Great hotel value for money and central	This hotel has a brilliant location, and is great value for money.A nice safe, central, clean and tidy hotel. We had just come from pretty much a five star hotel in Vegas so were a bit nervous about what this hotel would be like. The rooms were a good size, clean and comfortable. Everything was in good condition.The hotel rooms were nice and quiet, and the staff friendly and helpful. The location of the hotel was excellent. It was less than ten minutes walk to the main shopping area on Market Street, and the gorgeous Union Square was about five minutes walk, if that. So many lovely restaurants around to choose from, and not far from the central cable car route.We hada great time in San Francisco, no doubt made more enjoyable by staying in a lovely cosy hotel. I felt very at home here, both in the hotel and San Fran.Would definitely stay again.	
May 23 2009 	This hotel is in ideal location with good services and we would like to go back in the future.	This hotel's staffs are very friendly and helpful. We stayed in Donatello for 3 nights and found that the location is perfect for taking public transportation. So a rental car is not needed. We didn't use all the available facilities but the daily complimentary breakfast is nice.	
May 22 2009 	The Donatello lived up to its Tripadvisor hype.	My friend and I just returned from a two-night stay at The Donatello. I had read the many positive reviews, and the experience lived up to my expectations. The staff was unfailingly polite, cheerful, helpful, and downright friendly--particularly Ed at the reception desk. We arrived 2-1/2 hours before the 3 p.m. check-in time, so Ed took my cell phone number and called to tell us when our room was ready. The room was large, clean, comfortable, and very light, with large windows that afforded a view of the SF skyline, and side windows that actually opened, providing welcome fresh air. We had asked for a quiet room, and our 10th floor location provided just that. Several fifth floor rooms shared a common terrace, but we were afraid that the street noise at that level might be more of a problem.The concierge (Peter) suggested we eat at Colibri, a wonderful restaurant serving Yucatan specialties, rather than the more typical fare one finds at most Mexican restaurants. The food was delicious, and the restaurant is located just around the block. Zingari, the hotel's second-floor restaurant-lounge, offers half-price appetizers and $5 house wines from 4-7 p.m. The portions were sufficiently large to serve as dinner for us the night we arrived.The continental breakfast provided excellent orange juice along with oranges, apples, muffins, croissants, breakfast pastries, tea, and coffee in the Club Room on the hotel's top floor. Surrounding the Club Room is an outdoor terrace area that provides great views of The City.The complimentary wi-fi was a definite plus. A computer is available in the lobby for those who are not traveling with a laptop. All in all, ours was an entirely positive experience at The Donatello, and I recommend the hotel without reservation.	
May 19 2009 	People at The Donatello go above and beyond expectations.	The hotel is centrally located to some of the best restuarants, shopping and transportation. Ed and Jesus at the front desk will make you feel special and right at home. Any tour, restuarant and attraction you want to see Moises is the person that will make sure you have an excellent experience. We have stayed at The Donatello before and loved our stay so much we decided to bring our friends so they too could experience the best customer service oriented destination possible. We had a choice of going anywhere but knew they would experience something magical in San Francisco and expecially at The Donatello because of the warm, caring people who work there. I highly recommend The Donatello and I know we will be visiting again very soon.	
May 15 2009 	great hotel	Stayed there for a week in April and loved it! The front desk staff was very nice and helpful. The room was great - very spacious and quiet. The concierge was very helpful with tour information. The housekeeping was excellent! We loved the location - close to main attractions. Everyone was super friendly. Would definitely stay there again!	
May 15 2009 	Excellent location great value and very friendly staff	We stayed here at the end of a two week holiday in California to enjoy the sites and sounds of San Francisco. Located just minutes from Union Square the location is excellent. Value for money also very good, with very competative rates for the area. Good links with local transport, a BART just down the road at Powell, and buses and cable cars to other interesting parts of the city, including Fishermans Wharf and Ocean Bay. Room is equipped with microwave, fridge, sink, cutlery and crockery, and coffee maker. Excellent free wifi for internet access and large telly with lots of channels, although our son wanted to watch the Stanley cup (ice hockey) on a channel that was not available....Only one minor gripe, our booking included continental breakfast, and on one day there was nothing left when we arrived. The continental breakfast just consists of coffee tea in thermos, orange juice (very nice) and muffin. Some days there were some croissants which made a nice change. Also fruit, apples, oranges, and bananas. Not much room to sit down to eat, so we normally took what was available back to the room to eat.Despite being in the middle of the city, our room on the 10th floor was very quiet. We were not disturbed by traffic noise at all.	
May 11 2009 	Excellent bang for the buck	Rubbing shoulders with some of the expensive hotels around Union Square, the prime location at a very good price is the best reason for staying at the Donatello. The room was spacious, well appointed and fairly attractive. It was also spotless, being kept in good order by very friendly room staff. The bed was good, but not the best. I thought too much street noise filtered through the windows during the night from street cleaners and various garbage trucks which always seemed to be around. Noise from adjacent rooms, however, was no worse than other hotels. The newspaper outside your door each morning was nice, but the complementary &quot;breakfast&quot; was less appealing. While the orange juice was fresh and coffee pretty good (both in paper cups), the high-fat, high-sugar pastries on offer were definitely not my idea of a nutritious breakfast. But at least they were fresh, gave you lots of energy... and who am I to look a gift horse in the mouth? Quibbles aside, I think the Donatello Hotel offers a great combination of amenities and location for the price (I paid less than $100 USD per night before taxes), and I would not hesitate to stay there again.	
May 11 2009 	Great Service Good Rooms Good Location. Breakfast?	This was the last leg of a 2 week vacation, a three night say in early May. This was our first time in SF, so I cannot compare to other places.The room (King, standard) was of sufficient size (400 sf) which I hear is a rarity in the city. The location is downtown amid the tall buildings. It is very close to Union Square and all methods of public transit.I chose the deal that included parking. I highly recommend this unless you are familiar with SF and know &quot;where&quot; to park already. Otherwise, Donatello is part of a property network that offers comps if you to listen to their sales pitch for an hour. Parking was one of the comps. We didn't do it, since I had parking in the deal already.In a city of this size, night time noise is expected and SF does not disappoint. We were 10th floor though I'm sure we could have been 1000th floor and it wouldn't have mattered. No biggie for me, I hope I didn't disturb the street life with my snoring.The city is busy and safety was of no real concern until dusk and later. When the throngs of people with permanent residences thin out, things looked a little tough a couple of times. There are some begging homeless, but I found them no more of a nuisance than the people that hand out girl cards in Las Vegas. Don't make eye contact and keep moving. In their defense, I saw a number of them giving directions. This is a characteristic of the city - not the hotel. I did not see anyone &quot;living&quot; near the hotel at night.You want service? You got it! We were immediately checked in and dished off to the concierge for a warm welcome and some useful information. Special mention of Ed (It's always Monday at the Donatello) at the desk, Sarah the concierge, and Joe the bellman. I'm sorry I don't remember the valet, but top notch there, too. Sarah was spot on with restaurant recommendations two out of three times (Fino's downtown and Alioto's on the wharf). Even the third was good - just not &quot;San Francisco&quot; good.The room also included a complimentary continental breakfast, available from 7:00 to 9:30. We were 0-2 on finding anything other than a muffin or a banana / apple. This was a bit of a disappointment (which I have also seen in other reviews). Sheesh, get a big fridge, have some cereals, pastries, jams, jellies, fruits, bagels, cream cheese - you know, the standards - and have enough to last the entire 2 1/2 hours. A little more attention to this and there will be precious little negative to say about the Donatello.I'm glad I stayed and look forward to a return visit.	
May 10 2009 	Solid value near Union Square	This was our first overnight stay in San Francisco, so although we have been there before on day trips, I have no other hotel experiences in SF to compare it to. That being said, we travel frequently as a family so I am familiar with similar such options in general.The valet parking package for an extra $20 a day is simply unbeatable in THIS city and there were no issues in that regard. I found other places charging $30-$50+ per night, so as &quot;locals&quot; making the trip from Monterey, we really had no options other than bring the car and were pleasantly surprised with it. The room itself was fairly spacious, but the layout a bit inefficient. This may have been due to being next to the elevator, but for the amount of space, separate living and sleeping areas would have been nice. The sofabed was located in the same room as the bed, so no luck in being able to put the kids to sleep at a different time. The furnishings are in a modern blue and tan decor, and the tv was nice so we still enjoyed the room and found it a pretty good value. Free wireless internet was also included and worked without issue. A small fridge and microwave were also included.We stayed on the sixth floor on a Friday -Sunday on Mother's Day weekend and found outside/street noise to be very prevalent at night with Saturday noise levels being enough to disturb sleep repeatedly. This may be common for hotels at Union Square as there are several night clubs in the area. I don't blame the hotel for this, but may be a consideration for travelers. Within hotel noise was not really an issue, even by the elevator, with only a rare loud grouping passing by. Other than the night noise, everything about this hotel was pleasant. Staff was friendly and attentive, the property clean, and the value for the space is outstanding. I would definitely come back if it was just my wife and myself, but might look for the quieter financial district when bringing children or perhaps insist on a higher floor to see if that alleviates the issue.Finally, a few notes about the trip itself to help others.First, skip the cable cars. Yes, I know that they sound like a romantic experience but the reality is long lines and packed cars, so you are far more likely to be viewing another rider's behind than parts of the city. For the same price ($5 a person) you can get a limo from Union Square to Fisherman's Wharf. If you absolutely must get on one, you will likely need to get on at either end of the line as we saw people repeatedly be told no room at each stop.Second, go to touristy spots early. We went to Pier 39 at opening (10 AM) and without the crowds, is actually a great place for sightseeing and to take the kids. By 1-3, the crowds are there and expect waits for a lot of stuff. Same goes for the Exploratorium. We got there at 10 on a free day expecting the worst, and again, not too bad for the first hour or two. Then the crowds commence. From a practical standpoint, we found 2-3 hours sufficient to view each.We also did the 1 hour Bay Cruise and found that enjoyable. Bring your jacket though.All in all, a very nice stay-cation and well worth the weekend. Thanks SF!	
May 8 2009 	Great Location with good sized rooms	We stayed for four days/five nights near the end of April 2009. The location is very good, only one block from Union Square with good restaurants all around. The service is efficient, the rooms are very comfortable and spacious and cost us £128 a night. However, the breakfasts are a little disappointing and the amount of room (located on the top floor) available to eat them is very limited. On our last day (a Sunday), they actually ran out of food (pastries and cookies) leaving some guests without. The hotel overall is very clean but the windows leading out onto the street, especially the attached Zingari restaurant (located on the second floor) were in desperate need of cleaning and this made the hotel look very shabby from the street. This can very easily resolved however. Our room was on the 6th floor and looked onto Post Street, there was some noise from the street below which occasionally disturbed us.	
May 3 2009 	Excellant location	Only 1 block from Union Square and very near the Powell Street Tram terminal and BART/Muni station, this was an ideal location for our holiday.The rooms were a very good size with a sofabed if required and well maintained. Guest services responded very quickly when required. All the staff were very polite, coutious and efficient.The only downside was the breakfast was only a small selection of muffins, pastries and apples. The breakfast room was small with few tables so it can be difficult getting a table to sit at.Overall a very good hotel and well priced.	
May 1 2009 	Good Value For Money	- Like: price, room size, location, staff, .- Dislike: Breakfast (only sweets), Internet (extremely slow), room furniture (not new and small workdesk) and bathroom (outdated), noisy airco's outside.	
Apr 30 2009 	Comfortable elegance top notch rooms.	Stayed here as part of a sister's weekend package. It was exactly what we were hoping for and more. Wine glasses, plates, cutlery, etc. all at the ready for the wine and cheese brought back in the evening. Close to publice transportation if you choose to use it. Walking distance to many things. I would definitely stay here again. The staff is superb. I couldn't get the TV to work and called the front desk only to realize that I had the DVD player remote after I hung up the phone! I called them back to let them know my mistake but within 2 minutes a maintenance person was there to correct the problem. This is representative of all the service.	
Apr 29 2009 	A First Class Hotel	The Donatello is a delightful place to stay one block from Union Square in San Francisco. It is central to almost anything you want to see or do in San Francisco. Recently I stayed one week and thoroughly enjoyed being pampered. Everything was perfect and the customer service was excellent. The beds, the Club Room, the front desk and concierge assistance could not have been better. The only negative was the noise from the nightclub from Mason St at 12 and 2 AM, but what do you expect from popular downtown San Francisco? I plan to return soon. Highly recommended.	
Apr 28 2009 	LocationLocation location!	This is clean, friendly, and easy to walk anywhere. one block over from Union Square, 1 minute away from all types of transportation. We showed up with all the stuff that 2 small babies need and everyone from parking attendants, bellmen to concierge were VERY helpful and PATIENT!	
Apr 28 2009 	great staff great room great location	Hotel scale is more intimate than grand, it is located one block from Union Square and the cable cars, and the parking package rate was very reasonable. The Donatello's strongest point is it's staff, all of whom were friendly and obviously focused on serving the guests. The room was very pleasant, with modern decor, lots of storage space, a microwave and small fridge. Included is access to a lounge on the top floor, where you can get coffee, tea and hot chocolate anytime, and juices, bagels, muffins and danish in the morning. We were totally comfortable here, and loved this hotel. (P.S. One of us is a light sleeper, but not bothered by the very popular club across the street!)	
Apr 26 2009 	Good experience	The hotel is well located in San Francisco downtown area, on a walking distance to many attractions and with bus line just one block away and good restaurants around it.	
Apr 25 2009 	Superb - Best choice in San Francisco	I stayed 7 nights at the Donatello with a group of 8 colleagues. The hotel is an excellent choice for any traveller and a great value in the city. We were all extremeley happy with the accomofations and will recommend the hotel to others.The location is great, 1 block away from Union Square and with easy access to the cablecars, Bart, etc. You can find dozens of restaurants within a 2 minute walk.The front desk service were all great, very attentive, and very fast.The rooms were very large, with a king size bed, a sofabed and a kitchennete in every room, large LCD TV, and DVD player. The rooms were all immaculate, and recently renovated. I cannot stress how nice the hotel rooms were.The free wireless Internet service was not great, but adequate enough for basic email and web needs.There was a nice gym with jacuzzi and spa.The one thing they can improve is the breakfast buffet, which basically was coffee/tea/orange juice and a selection of pastries - no bread, cerels, or hot items. Nevertheless, the Donatello is an excellent choice for any visit to San Francisco and is highly recommended.	
Apr 22 2009 	Wonderful first time stay in San Francisco.	My wife has been trying to get me to San Fran for years now. Finally went and wound up at the Donatello Hotel and had a wonderful 7 day stay there. Rooms were comfy. Shower nozzle could take your skin off and I didn't want to get out of it. Views were neat considering we were in a city. Staff was excellent and seemed genuinely pleased to see us. They made us feel comfortable and welcome. The breakfast was just muffins and sweet rolls and coffee, but the place we all shared was intimate and unless we wanted to sit on the floor we asked to sit with strangers. THAT was great and we shared some time with people from all over. We would stay there again in a heartbeat and will. We have no clue as to the on site restaurant as we were out all the evenings we were there.	
Apr 20 2009 	Loved everything!	Great rooms great service! I so wanted to try the spa but we had to leave early for my meeting at the other side of the bay =(	
Apr 20 2009 	Awesome stay	Great location - Union Square one block away. My wife is hard to please but couldn't fault the cleanliness of the room. Complimentary breakfast consisted of fresh pastries, fruit, juice and tea and coffee - simple but adequate. We appreciated the complimentary internet computer in the lobby as we don't travel with a computer.Without doubt, this was the best value hotel during our 3 weeks of travel in the USA.	
Apr 19 2009 	Great SF find	We have stayed at the Donatello before, and remembered it as a nice, comfortable hotel with great value. Sure enough - it still is. We had recently stayed at the JW Marriott across the street and wondered why for twice the price. The Donatello is a smaller hotel but with nice ammenities, good service, comfortable rooms (nice to have microwave, refrigerator and dishes). It is clean and comfortable. The beds are too hard. But that is the only negative I can come up with. It is in a great location, within easy walking distance of shopping, cable cars &amp; restaurants. We had a nice little terrace too! Don't spend more - this is still a great place to stay.	
Apr 13 2009 	Don't Miss Staying Here	Location, service, accommodations and staff are excellent. Treat yourself and plan a stay here.	
Apr 12 2009 	Great location amenities and staff	Had two suites for a recent girl's weekend. The hotel is very convenient to BART which really saves on ground transportation costs. The location to shopping and sites can't be beat. We walked to the Ferry Building Farmer's Market and it was a quick cab ride to the War Memorial Opera House for the ballet. The rooms are exactly like the photos on the Web site. It was great having the bar sink, fridge and microwave in the room since we could snack while we visited. The rooms are very spacious with nice big windows which let in lots of natural light. One night we brought in food and just watched movies. The hotel has a huge selection of premium movie channels: HBO, Showtime, etc. The complimentary morning breakfast is a nice touch as is the club level lounge and terrace and the complimentary WiFi. Housekeeping was excellent and the front desk and the concierge really went out of their way to be friendly and attentive. This place gets a big thumbs up from us and we're a picky group!	
Apr 7 2009 	Best hotel ever!!!!	This is an amazing hotel and in a great location, close to everything. The staff is extremely accommodating and it's a great value. Loved the free breakfast too. The free internet was great to have too. Will surely stay there again! (And for anyone who wants a great place to eat when there check out Lori's Diner, it's so reasonably priced for the area and the food is tasty!)	
Apr 5 2009 	Wonderful Experience	I was travelling with a friend and it was my first trip to San Francisco. I was thrilled with both the great location and the hotel itself. The concierge and desk clerk when I checked in were both excellent. I don't remember their names, but I checked in around 1:30 PM on 3/19/09. The rooms are spacious and the breakfast was very fresh with nice selection for a continental breakfast. I will definitely stay here again on my next trip to San Francisco.	
Apr 2 2009 	Great Hotel in a Pefect Location	We recently stayed at the Donatello with our two young children. It is in a perfect location 1 block from Union Square and the Powell Street cable car line. The staff was very friendly and the rooms were clean and very large. We had a king size bed with a pull out couch and still had plenty of floor space. The room also had a nice plasma tv and a dvd which was nice for the kids after a long day exploring SF. There was also a continental breakfast with fruit, bagels, muffins, donuts and juice which made it easy to get an early start to the day. When I return to SF I am definitely statying at the Donatello.	
Mar 29 2009 	Great Hotel!	We stayed at the Donatello recently with our 6 year old son. We had the studio suite with a king bed and sofa bed. The room was huge, clean, had a great area with sink, coffee-maker, fridge, microwave &amp; toaster - plus some basics such as salt &amp; pepper, plates, wine glasses &amp; wine opener. The staff was fabulous and extremely helpful! Highly recommend for great room, great location &amp; great staff!	
Mar 28 2009 	good location and accomodations	The Donatello is a nice place because of its location in Union Square and cleanliness of hotel. The rooms are spacious and comfortable, though the pillows could be better. They were very flat, but large enough to fold over to have adequate fluff. The housekeeeping staff was pleasant and helpful. They offered extra towels/linens and turn down service daily, though we did not ask for it to be more environmentally responsible. The continental breakfast provided was convenient as we preferred to sleep in and eat in our rooms each morning. We appreciated the perk, though the woman concierge was quite rude. She did not smile and watched over us with her arms crossed. She even had the nerve to ask me what room I was in even though she saw me sign in! The front desk staff and others were friendly and courteous. They acknowledged us with a smile or greeting every time we passed through the lobby. Overall, we enjoyed our stay at the Donatello and would recommend this hotel to others.	
Mar 27 2009 	very enjoyable	Great place to stay close to the cable cars and transportation, easy to get to everything from the donatello, like union square fishermans wharf the castro and other sight seeing places. The staff were very friendly and helpfull and the rooms very spacious and clean. buffet breakfast that was a bonus as well as we wern't expecting that. you are given a welcome pack when you arrive which helps you decide on any tours or sight seeing trips you might like to plan	
Mar 25 2009 	This hotel is a bargain - nice rooms great location.	We've stayed at the Donatello several times over the last 2 years. This trip was the first with our 2 young kids. It was great. The service has always been friendly and speedy, the location in Union Square was great for us, and the room we got was very spacious (some rooms are bigger than others -- ask when making your reservation if you need more space for more people). The rooms all have only one bed, but there is also sofa-sleeper in each room.	
Mar 22 2009 	Giant rooms contemporary feel great service INEXPENSIVE	We got a great deal on a room here -- the &quot;Recession Special&quot; for $101/night. I booked a stay here largely because of the large room size-- all their rooms are over 400 square feet -- we were traveling with our 14 month old, and I wanted lots of room since we were putting up a pack and play. I also liked the location next to Union Square, a safe, nice shopping area in San Francisco and central to all neighborhoods.The rooms are HUGE. Our room (708) just happened to be laid out perfectly for a baby... there was a small enclave as you walked in that was the perfect size for the pack and play, and slightly removed from our section of the room. So when we put him to bed at 8pm, we didn't have to sit in a dark, silent room. My parents had a room next door, and theirs was laid out a little differently, but also very cool.The rooms are decorated very contemporary and stylish. I liked it a lot. There was a fridge where we could store all of our baby food, a microwave, coffee maker, second sink (right next to the bed, which I loved in the middle of the night), and utensils (!). You could live here and cook all your meals if you wanted to! The room was so huge, there was room for 2 chairs and a sofa.Also, there was a continental breakfast that was free every morning on the top floor. Nothing fancy, but a nice, unexpected bonus. Get there early because they did run out of things.We loved, loved this hotel. The people there were INCREDIBLY friendly and accommodating. I can't recommend this place enough, especially for the value and if you're traveling with a baby.	
Mar 21 2009 	Great place to stay. Good location. Highly recommend.	Great place to stay. Excellent location. Nice big clean comfortable rooms. Very friendly helpful staff. Complimentary breakfast &amp; tea &amp; coffee anytime in a comfortable sitting room which overlooks the city. Enjoyed a nice meal in the restaurant as well. If coming from the airport it's a cheap ride on the Bart Train to Powell Street Station &amp; then a short walk to the hotel. Same going back to the airport.	
Mar 19 2009 	Excellent hotel	I have been to SF a number of times and have stayed in a number of hotels. I was impress with the Donatello Hotel First in centrally located, an step away from restaurant, cable cars, Union Square, and best fashion store in town. Rooms were spacious and clean, staff very friendly and the Restaurant AAA+ I would certainly recommend the hotel.	
Mar 19 2009 	Good value staff and location	We had a great rate for the off-season which always allows for overlooking certain things, although the room was just fine. The front desk staff are very hospitable. The location, just a block from Union Square, is convenient. A detail I appreciate is that the windows can be open for fresh air. I brought my 6 year old with me on this business trip and it was perfect for her. I've stayed at the established hotel and the entitled quaint inn in the Union Square area and I will opt for this hotel first the next time I have to travel to San Francisco because of the value.	
Mar 18 2009 	Great Value	I picked this hotel based on the Tripadvisor reviews. The reviews were accurate. I stayed for two nights. The room was very clean and quiet. The bed comfortable. The staff helpful. The location outstanding.	
Mar 18 2009 	Great location great rooms great service and a bargin as well	We stay the Donatello when ever we go into San Francisco. It is just a block off Union Sq. and 1 to 2 blocks to a number of theaters as well as great restaurants and clubs. The rooms are really large with plenty of room to spread out. The hotel has valet parking right on the premises and getting your car takes no more than 5 min. or so. The staff is great, friendly and helpful. Since we lived in SF for 35 years until 2005 we don't usually take advantage of the Concierge services. We have eaten in the Zingari Restaurant in the past and it is top notch. One of the many things we like about the Donatello is the fact it has nice bar with live jazz and a happy hour. All in all it is the best deal in town!! We have stayed at two other hotels of similar size, price and location, but you can not beat the Donatello. This is our home away from home!	
Mar 17 2009 	The Donatello is a great San Francisco hotel.	Whenever we take a trip to San Francisco and need to stay in the Union Square area, we select The Donatello. It is just a few blocks from Union Square, the major department stores and great restaurants are an easy walking distance. The personnel at the hotel are very friendly and helpful. The rooms are spacious and are equipped with microwaves, refrigerator and dishes plus the usual TVs and CD/radios. Since my husband is handicapped, we have received extra, friendly help from the bellmen and since we frequent often, they are most gracious to us. The hotel is not fancy but it is attractive, comfortable and clean.	
Mar 17 2009 	Great location and staff	We found the location great and the staff were so helpful. Only negative would be the noise outside but hard to avoid in the location.	
Mar 12 2009 	very good option among so many offers	I've been to many san francisco hotels to attend medical meeting but this isw by far the best quality-money. very well located, very good rooms and staff perfect. one day they forget to clean the room and as soon as we call, a girl came (unfortunately she did his job in one minute). we also have a complimentary breakfast (we didn´t expect so).	
Mar 12 2009	Great room good value helpful staff	Very comfortable hotel in great location. Loved the upstairs lounge which provided free coffee throughout the day. Nice jacuzzi and fitness centre. Staff were very helpful and friendly. The room was spacious and nicely decorated. Would definitely stay there again.	
Mar 12 2009 	Great place	This is a great place and with a good location. Walking distance to downtown attractions.	
Mar 11 2009 	A real find!	San Francisco hotels are just too pricey in today's economy, but The Donatello is a real find. My wife and I didn't know what to expect and we were so delighted, we've already booked rooms for May ( Mother's Day) and July ( a birthday). The room was large, clean, quiet and comfortable. And, in addition to the fridge, microwave and coffee maker, there was a free Continental breakfast in their top floor Club room, with a great view of the city. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful with restaurant suggestions, which, combined with the super room charge, made our 3 night stay affordable and enjoyable.	
Mar 11 2009 	A great hotel to stay	Location of the hotel is great, close to Union Square, a few blocks from Market Street.10-12 minutes walk to Convention Center.Room is large with King-size bed and Sofa-bed but still is roomy. A little annoying is the tables/desks, small and a few.Wireless works well; a little annoying is need to log in if idles for 10-15 minutes.Breakfast on the top level/club is great. Nice (and big) donut, multiple choice of coffee, plenty of fruits. Wireless and breakfast are the most important things for us to select this hotel. A little annoying is the breakfast stars at 7am not earlier and room is small, sometimes too crowdy.Hotel staffs are friendly and helpful, taxi driver waiting for you in the lobby after you reserved.We stayed at this hotel at the cost of $155 per night in average. A great rate even considering the convention has a special rates on several nice hotels: an average of $100 more.	
Mar 9 2009 	Great location great value!	Despite all the wonderful reviews of The Donatello, we were unprepared for the reality upon arriving at the hotel and our room. The view was overlooking Post Street toward another hotel (not a bad thing!) and within easy walking distance to Union Square and the cable car line. The room was large, apparently recently remodeled, with a &quot;kitchenette&quot; area containing coffee pot, microwave, mini-fridge, toaster, selection of coffees, cups, saucers, silver ware, and glassware. Also, the standard clock-radio along with an LCD TV and mini-stereo. Sharing the room with the king-size bed was a sofa, upholstered chair, end table and floor lamp. As someone else mentioned, this was a great spot to return to after a day of sight-seeing. Highly recommended!!	
Mar 5 2009 	Girls Weekend	My girlfriends and I had a great girls weekend there. We stayed just one night on Feb 30. The service was GREAT!!! the front desk recommended great places for us to eat and to dance the night away. One drawback was we needed an extra mirror in the bedroom/living room area and near an outlet it's had for 3 girls to get dolled up in a small bathroom with only one mirror and one outlet but other then that we had a great time and we will be returning the first weekend in April. : )	
Mar 4 2009 	Perfect Location 	The staff at the hotel was great, especially the concierge located on the top floor (i can't think of his name right now!) The location is a block away from Powell Street and the cable car lines. There are quite a few restaurants open pretty late just down the street on Post. I felt pretty safe walking around at night in this neighborhood	
Mar 3 2009 	A Haven within the Heart of San Francisco	Great experience. The location is in the heart of San Francisco near Union Square. The staff were universally attentive, knowledgeable and informed. The room was comfortable, cozy and clean. The restaurant was convenient, intimate and served very tasty fare. The Club on top floor, with gym and spa, was an added bonus. The ONLY area for improvement would be the speed of the wireless internet...a little slow...perhaps due to multiple guests using at the same time of day.	
Mar 2 2009 	The Donatello is cheerful and unpretentious and is a perfect jumping off point for walks to almost all points in San Francisco.	The room was generously sized and nicely appointed. The staff was friendly without being solicitous (except for the back door solicitation from the concierge to encourage a trip to their time sharing sales department which we were able to easily deflect). We stayed over a Friday and a Saturday night. There is a club on Mason across from the hotel and a garage on Mason adjacent to the hotel (on the south side of the hotel)that caused more than typical urban street scene noise both nights into the wee hours. (The noise from the exuberant queue waiting to get into the club, the constant buzz of the garage pedestrian warning alarm as cars came and went and the clanking of the 5:00 am clean up team apparently responsible for dumping huge amounts of glass bottles from one container to another.) I would stay at this hotel again, but i would make arrangements for a room on the north side of the building facing on to Post.	
Mar 1 2009 	Great Staff Nice Room Great Location	The room was large, clean and nicely furnished. There was a nice terrace outside the room. The staff was extremely helpful and polite. The location is terrific. Parking was easy. The lounge is very nice and the singer and piano player were very talented. This place was a delight.	
Feb 28 2009 	Absolutely the best	We just returned from our two night stay at Donatello for our Anniversary. We had a great stay there. The hotel is only 1 block from the Union Square which is very convenient to many attractions in San Francisco. The room is very spacious and comfortable. The price is very reasonable. What impressed us the most is their super friendly and professional staff. When they found out it's our Anniversary, they delivered a bottle of wine and a box of chocolate to our room which made our anniversary night even more romantic. We especially want to give our thanks to the front desk person Ed Cortez and the Lobby service staff Joe B. . They both went out of their way to make sure we had a great experience which we did. We definitely recommend this hotel.	
Feb 26 2009 	One of the Best	Great service; comfortable rooms, great location/amenities. A very positive experience.	
Feb 25 2009 	Good Value for the money but Noisy !	I was there overthe Valentines long weekend, and asked in advance for a quiet room with a view. I got a room on the 5th floor with a little terrace, but in Feb it was of no use. It was too close to street level (the noise was too much), and I didn't have a very good sleep that night. When I walked into the room I found it to be tiny, and the carpet and bathroom a bit tired. I asked at the front desk if I could get another room, and the the girl left a note for the day staff to set me up with a *better* room (she claimed there would be none available until the next morning) . The next morning I headed downstairs and talked to Jesus (yes that's his name) and he was very nice, and relocated me and my bags (while I was out) to the 10th floor. The room there was mich nicer, however the noise was still problematic, but not as bad. There was some kind of shrill that kept coming from across the street, and it occurred to me on my last night that it's the doorman (I think) of the hotel across the street, using a whistle to hail cabs. It was rather annoying, but if you kept all the windows closed I managed to get some sleep. The cleaning staff kept opening the windows every day, so I had to keep closing them.Oh yeah...the maids knock on your door at 8:00 a.m. !!! which is incredibly stoopid...so you need to leave the &quot;Do Not Disturb&quot; sign out, or expect to be waken up, and they will come in unless you go to the door to tell them to go away !The shower-head was a disaster. You cannot adjust the pressure, and instead of a nice &quot;shower&quot;, it bolted out like a firehose, and I literally had to get on my hands and knees in the tub to keep my scalp from blowing off from the water pressure (it was the same type of shower-head in both rooms I was in, so I suspect it's the same all over the hotel). It was also too low vertically. If you're 6 feet or taller, you'd have to be bending over regardless. Either way...you'll be on your hands and knees to shower, so good luck with that !The breakfast room on the &quot;Club Level&quot; (same floor as the gym) was nice enough, and the continental style food was fine. Good coffee, bagels and pastries ! There is only seating for about 10 people though, and the hotel has about 20 floors...so you do the math. After one attempt, I just took the food to go after that. Once I just went up to get it and came right back down to my room with a paper plate of food.The front desk staff and the doormen were great though, they were very accomodating in listening to concerns, and orfering airport shuttles. They also have a map pad that is handy for when you're heading out at the strart of your day. I got a new sheet every day, and never managed to get lost !The beds are hard to describe, but they are very comfortable, and linens were good.The rooms have FREE Wi-Fi, so I was happy about that. I could check my email and FaceBook every night without getting gouged with extra fees !The price I paid was based on a &quot;recession special&quot; and for San Fran it was pretty good ($620. for 5 nights), so there is value for the money ~ I was happy once I got the 2nd room, otherwise my stay there would of been a negative one I think.It's at a good downtown location, just a block from Union Square, and a couple from Market St. (major shopping). You need transportation down to the wharf (waterfront) area, but that's Ok. I pre-bought a 2 day &quot;On/Off&quot; double-decker tour bus ticket, and it's main stop is at Union Square, so my transporation around town was taken care of, and I got the narration as I went ! All the &quot;On/Off&quot; tour bus companies stop at Union Square, so all good there - I hightly recommed them !..they only stop at the major tourist stops/areas all over town (including both sides of the Golden Gate Bridge), and you get a narration as you go...I only took cabs at night after the tour bus's stopped (after 5 p.m.). They service each stop every 30 minutes or so (although there was one cheap company I read about that only did it once an hour - so shop accordingly !Anyway, I digress. The Donatello would likely get my business again, but keep in mind the above, and the fact that the actual rooms do not look as nice as their website. But San Francisco is an expensive town for accomodation, and their rates are competitive, so unless you're made of cash, it's a good option to keep in mind.	
Feb 25 2009 	Great in many ways but not perfect	We just returned from a 2 day stay at the Donatello. The location is great for a city visit. The rooms were immaculate, the staff was friendly and helpful (with one exception). Our room had a plumbing problem and the maintenance staff was up to fix it, even before I returned from the front desk. Even though the literature promised wireless internet in the rooms, none was available in ours. There was a lot of noise in the room. Some from the water pipes and other from some sort of loud machinery that was run somewhere in the hotel. The staff were great and went out of their way to be helpful. The one exception was a woman who saw her job, at the club room, as a rather grim customs inspector, making sure we all signed in and that my wife not steal the 4 grapes that she was bringing to her daughter, who was not feeling well. The bottom line is, I would definitely stay there again. The charm and service outweighs the few draw backs.	
Feb 25 2009 	Great location/value	We stayed for 10 days. The staff was wonderful. Great value- we highly recommend.	
Feb 24 2009 	Wonderful comfortable hotel	We've stayed at the Donatello many times and are always pleased. We love the convenient location - only a block from Union Square and world class shopping. The rooms are large and have microwaves, refrigerators and coffee machines. Staff is extremely helpful and friendly. It's like coming home!!	
Feb 23 2009 	Excellent as usual	We have just returned from a 3 night stay at The Donatello. We have stayed there a few times before and the standard was excellent. The studio room with the microwave, fridge and small kitchen area is perfect for us. The Union Square location is perfect and is so convenient for the cable cars. The bed was just so comfy. We got a really good deal and had the parking packag e as well. What more can I say????I would not stay anywhere else in San Francisco.	
Feb 23 2009 	Great hotel wonderful Club room	The Donatello is in an excellent location at Union Square and perfect for business and fun. Our room was a corner room with lots of light and a sofa bed to sit on and relax. We loved the Club room with the fresh bagels, cold orange juice and hot coffee. It is our place to stay when we come to SF and will recommend to all our friends.	
Feb 22 2009 	One Word: Awesome!!!	On the Presidents day weekend a few friends &amp; I headed to San Francisco for the weekend &amp; we elected to stay at the Donatello. Although the hotel is part of the Shell Vacations Club, anyone can stay there.The staff at the hotel were friendly, courteous, accommodating (E.G. Late Check Out), overall Awesome. The hotel was very clean &amp; well kept. Both our rooms were Hugh compared to some rooms I have stayed in San Francisco &amp; included a mini fridge, microwave, coffee maker, coffee, utensils, etc. The room had a pull out sofa which was larger than normal &amp; the king size bed was awesome. There is lots of storage space for your clothes, either in drawers or in a closet. The bathrooms were a good size which I think could accommodate someone in a wheelchair, but if you are someone who needs wheelchair access I would suggest you contact the hotel just to make sure. All rooms have flat screen TV's, CD &amp; DVD players. There are windows in the room that do open just enough so that a child can't fall out, which I like as I prefer fresh air over a ventilation system, however it did have both. With the windows open I did sometime notice the noise at night but I did have the option of closing the window plus you are in San Francisco what can one expect. The hotel provides a FREE, yes free, continental breakfast every morning, which included bagels, muffins, pastries, fresh fruit, coffee, tea, orange juice which was good enough to get you through the morning. On Friday afternoons they also provide a FREE, yes free, 2 hr wine &amp; cheese tasting on the Club floor which is at the top of the hotel where the continental breakfast is provided each morning &amp; where there is a small but adequate gym, co-ed whirlpool &amp; saunas in each of the change rooms, which also have showers. The Gym, whirlpool, sauna's &amp; change rooms were VERY well kept.The hotel is conveniently located about a 5 to 10 minute walk from the BART's Powell St station, which is San Franciscos light rail subway system that runs from San Francisco International Airport &amp; only costs a mere $5.35 US per person one way &amp; takes approximately 35 to 45 minutes to get from the airport to the Powell St station, which I highly recommend as its quick &amp; cheap plus I think the BART is the cleanest public transit system I've been on in years, in fact there were people walking through the train on our way to the hotel picking up garbage, talk about impressive. The overall location of the hotel was great, close to Union Square for those who like to shop, lots of restaurants, China town was a few blocks away &amp; access to the BART, MUNI, buses &amp; street cars were only a few minutes away. I took a street car (not a Cable car, they are $5.00 per person) from one of the many stations located on Market St ( which is which is about a 5 to 10 minute walk from the hotel) to Fisherman's Warf &amp; it was only $1.50 per person one way &amp; the transfer I was given was good for almost 3 hrs. At the hotel both the Concierge desk on the main floor or the one on the Club floor can make arrangements for all your travel needs (Tours, Restaurants, etc) &amp; at reasonable prices. One thing to keep in mind parking in San Francisco is not cheap, so if you can get by without renting a car try using there transit systems, its awesome. This hotel was great for me (a 46 yr old professional male) &amp; my friends, in short, if you want a clean, friendly, well located &amp; reasonably priced hotel, try The Donatello. I hope you enjoy your stay as much as we did. Cheers, ChristopherCalgary, Canada	
Feb 22 2009 	We would definitely stay there again.	The staff was so wonderful and friendly, always there to assist in any way. Our room was very large and comfy and the location was terrific. We went in the hot tub and that was nice and the continental breakfast was most adequate. If you are a pastry lover.....you'll have quite a selection to choose from! Best of all, the price was very reasonable for the quality and location. Next time we won't bother shopping around---hello Donatello!	
Feb 19 2009 	Good value GREAT location!	When we read the reviews for this hotel we were impressed, but it is REALLY necessary to book a room above the 7th floor. IT can be VERY noisy near the street level. We booked through the Shell Hospitality website, and we were given a &quot;total rate&quot;. Unfortunately this was not the total and we did not find this out until check out. Parking was to be included, not &quot;discounted&quot; as it turned out. Therefore, after taxes the total rate was over $100 more than originally quoted. PLUS, we called prior to our arrival to verify the &quot;included&quot; parking. Other than that, our stay was fine. The staff was pleasant, the rooms very clean and the location is spot on! Everything is walkable!! I would avoid the breakfast, though, (great crepe place nearby; &quot;Honey, Honey&quot;, instead). It may have been the time of year we were there, but the fruit was not very good at the breakfast, so unless you crave donut-type things, forget it. Overall, we would consider staying here again, IF we could asure the correct balance at the end of our stay.	
Feb 19 2009 	Great location complimentary breakfast and accomodations	Just returned from a 2 night stay at the Donatello. Very impressed by the size of the room, comfortable king sized bed, mini kitchen, complimentary breakfast with wide range of good quality baked goods and fruits served on top floor overlooking the city, and work out room. Super location jusf off Union Square, easy walking to various sites and food. I found the deal on the Internet and was very pleased with everything about it.	
Feb 19 2009 	A real gem of a hotel	Our first trip to San Francisco and booked The Donatello after reading reviews on Trip Advisor. It was better than the reviews, the room was clean, large and had evrything you could want including wet bar, coffee maker, microwave etc.Its location so close to Union Square, the cable cars and the shopping district is igeal, and the tourist areas are easily reached by a short cable car ride or tram.Breakfast excellent in the Club lounge on top floor (15th) and Gym and spa pool available for use. Also good Itlaian restaurant on 2nd floor called Zingari.Most impotant however were the staff all of whom could not have been more helpful or friendly.If you go to San Francisco this is the hotel to go for.	
Feb 17 2009 	Excellent Hotel - Would stay at no other hotel in San Francisco	It was my first stay in San Francisco. A colleague had recommended another nearby hotel in the city....but that other place did not have air conditioning nor a refrigerator in the room. Since I was staying in the city for two weeks, I definitely wanted both those things. So after reading the reviews here and at other sites, I decided on The Donatello. It was great! My room was huge! And while some other reviews recommended asking for a room away from the street to reduce the noise.....my room was on the 8th floor and facing the street and I only heard noise outside at night a few times (more so during the weekends than during the week.) The bed was extremely comfortable, the pillows were great (two things I'm very picky about!) Turn-down service each night with chocolates left at your bed side. I did not eat at the restaurant in the hotel because there were so many wonderful restaurants to choose from within one or two blocks from the hotel. Great location...near Union Square....about four blocks from the BART station at Powell street. There was only one thing that I had an issue with....and that was the wireless internet service. The signal in my room was too low to ever connect to my laptop. However I was able to use the hotel guest computer the few times that I needed it.....plus I used my computer all day long at my work location so not having a computer in my room was not a huge issue - although it would have been nice to have during the weekend when I was planning my stops at some of the tourist spots. I only went to the breakfast buffet on the weekend. Not much there other than pastries, bagels, juice and coffee.....but again, plenty of restaurants close by and if you're there on a Saturday morning, the best bet for breakfast is the Farmer's Market at Ferry Plaza. Not sure if my travels will take me back to San Francisco but if I do go back, I will stay at no other hotel!	
Feb 15 2009 	Friendly staff comfortable room. We'd go back.	We liked the location near Union Square. We walked to the ACT Theater and ate dinner at the Daily Grill about a block away. Excellent!	
Feb 11 2009 	Great Location in San Francisco	Great hotel for the price I paid. Service at door and desk was fast and efficient. Everyone went out of their way to meet our needs. Room was clean and they even turned down our bed at night and left a chocolate!	
Feb 10 2009	Loved San Francisco 	When I was offered an exchange from my sharetime advisor all I asked it was the city, San Francisco, they recommended the hotel, The Donatello. What a great choice! It is located only one block from the main Square and from there only two blocks to the Cable cars station. I absolutely loved San Francisco and I loved the hotel too; it is comfortable, great service from everyone, well located, elegant, and good prices for what they offer, stay and food. My only regret is that I could not stay a little longer to enjoy the hotel a little more since I was out almost all day trying to see as much as I could during my brief stay.Mérida, Yucatán, México	
Feb 9 2009	Unfortunate experience	As original owners of The Suites at Fisherman's Wharf, we wanted to experience a stay in the downtown area, so booked with The Donatello to celebrate our Anniversary of 44 yrs. Unfortunately, our stay was not a good experience! We were awakend at 1:30am by loud singing and talking which continued until 3:45am - this made for a very long night! The bed pillows were very uncomfortable (too hard)!On a positive note, Room 511 was a lovely room with an outside patio &amp; the amenities (soft drinks, chocolates &amp; candy) to help celebrate our 44th Anniversary were very much appreciated. Thank you for that touch of kindness!D Hogan	
Feb 6 2009	donatello hotel	very spacious rooms ,excellent service fantastic position- loved it	
Feb 5 2009 	Exceptional value	Ideal location. Spacious room. Amenities well above the norm (complimentary breakfast, internet access, even premium cable channels). The nicest and most accommodating personnel. The &quot;hard&quot; parts of the rooms (tiles, etc.) are showing their age, but everything else is new-ish and rigorously clean. An exceptional value for a low price.	
Feb 4 2009	Best deal in a perfect location	My mom and sis had a great time bonding in our San Francisco tour. We stayed in The Donatello and it was located in the heart of everything we need and everything that interest us. The location of our hotel was so perfect because everything was so accessible like the cable train, the muni, taxi, subway, malls, restaurants, and about just anything you can think of. We enjoyed our stay in the hotel from the day we checked in. The people in the front desk made us feel that we belong to SF. They showed us every possible way to help us enjoy and maximize our stay in this amazing city. The staff was very friendly and service was superb!For those who wish to have a feel of the busy life in SF, this is a great place to stay in. Nothing to worry even if the people around us was busy because this hotel was the perfect place to just lay back and relax. After a day of exploring and viewing the sites in SF we go home tired and ready to retire our body. The pleasant room will offer the warmth and cuddling our tired body needs and rejuvenate us to prepare ourselves for another magnificent day!	
Feb 3 2009 	A hotel worthy of many more stays	Great hotel in a wonderful location--one block from cable car and other metro connections--no need to mess with a car!! Staff was very welcoming and accomodating, rooms were large and sunny. A great month to visit the city--no big crowds, crab season and the home of Irish Coffee!! We visit San Francisco twice a year, first time at the Donatello--we will return!!	
Feb 3 2009 	beautiful SF	THE HOTEL is very nice, clean and centrally located.It's perfect and not so expensive in comparison to the other hotels in this area.	
Jan 31 2009 	Loved the Donatello	This was a trip for my mom who had to go to UCSF for some cancer testing....I wanted a nice place where she would feel comfortable and enjoy the trip. Well....the Donatello surpassed any expectations I had....the hotel is well located in the theater district and near Union Square...ALL the staff were exceptionally professional, friendly, helpful and curteous....the hotel was warm and very clean...the rooms were large especially for San Francisco and they were clean and fun and very nicely appointed. We ate at the restaurant - Zingari - in the hotel because my mom could not walk far.....what a find! The food was amazing and the staff were right there when needed and very helpful....The morning continental breakfast was perfect and the receiving the morning paper was a nice extra touch....My mom loved the whole experience and I will certainly return as often as I can.....What a jewel in among the large less personal hotels.....I have no suggestions for improvement!	
Jan 31 2009 	Great Get Away	The location of the Donatello was perfect for celebrating the 83rd birthday of my dear friend. We wanted to visit Union Square, ride the cable car and once again enjoy the old San Francisco we knew from 40 years ago. Our room at the Donatello was spacious, comfortable and gave us easy access (while on foot.) to all the sights and the cable cars. After checking out various restaurants during the day, we decided the Zingari was comparable in price and menu to the other resturnents near by. It was so convinent to the hotel that it was our best choice. We were not disappointed. My friend wants to bring other family members to San Francisco this summer and hopes to once again stay at the Donatello. It was a great birthday get away for us!	
Jan 27 2009 	Pleasantly Surprised!!!!	As a corporate meeting planner by profession, I rarely stumble across properties that make me say &quot;WOW&quot;. The Donatello, was just that property.My boyfriend and I wanted an evening in the city and found the Donatello offering a great deal so, we took the chance without knowing anything about it and booked it. What a complete delight.The rooms were very modern (actually huge by typical San Francisco standards), very clean, the kitchen area cabinets were well stocked with corkscrews, wine glasses, cups, a microwave, a small refridgerator and anything else you might like for a weekend getaway.The staff was delightful and we even had a nice continental breakfast included.Simply put, we loved our stay and can't wait to come back!	
Jan 26 2009 	Great stay!	My stay at the Donatello was awesome! My g/f and I got there late (about 1am). Valet came right out and greated us. We checked into the room and had no problems. The room was good sized and clean. The bed was very comfortable. The Donatello is also right in the middle of where I wanted to be. My only gripe is I was called the first morning of my stay by the concierge and asked to attend a 90 minute presentation by their owners (Shell Resorts) and they would comp my valet parking or give me a $100 shopping spree to Macy's. Uhh, what? I'm here for a weekend of sight seeing, not to attend some sales pitch. If it weren't for that, I would have given them 5 stars.	
Jan 23 2009 	Great Value Spacious Rooms and Attentive Staff	I really enjoyed my visit to The Donatello. We booked through priceline and when we were assigned The Donatello I was excited to see the quality and reviews that I got for the price ($65 a night) The reality of the hotel far exceeded those online reviews from other travelers. We arrived very late (1 am) and Michelle was at the front desk smiling and greeted us when we arrived. Michelle did a wonderful job getting us a quiet room on the side of the hotel opposite of the noisy club. She also had a bottle of wine delivered up to our room once she found out that it was our anniversary. The concierges gave us excellent directions as well as an excellent map that we used throughout our trip. They also assisted us with information on getting day passes for the cable cars and the best and most efficient routes to get places. The Powell line of cable cars stop only one block from the hotel. The continental breakfast was delicious, plentiful, and was only rivaled by the beautiful view from the rooftop tables. Every one that I saw walk into the hotel was greeted immediately either by the concierge, the housekeeping staff, or the people at the front desk. They truly put the guests first in every aspect. The only minor complaint was that the wireless signal in my room was weak and I had to reposition myself several times to get online. This was probably because we were at the end of the hall. I really can't complain though because the wireless access as well as the Overall though, it was one of the best hotel stays I have ever had during all of my vacation trips.	
Jan 21 2009 	Loved the Donatello	Kind, attentive staff; roomy, well located, quiet and would stay again. The attached restaurant has a happy hour with half off the appetizers. Well worth your time.	
Jan 21 2009 	Great location large rooms good value	We stayed at the Donatello for four nights, and while parking was a little pricey this hotel was excellent value. We had a corner studio room which was very spacious with a seating area and flat screen tv. There was a fridge and microwave as well as some crockery and cutlery. The bathroom was a little small but had everything you would need. Great view from the hotel room down Post St to Union Square which was a five mintue walk. The jacuzzi and gym is a bonus providing a nice place to relax after a day trekkign round the city. The breakfast was a little basic but there are plenty of restaurants and diners nearby to grab brunch. There is also a jazz lounge with a pianist and singer and bar area providing afforable tapas during happy hour. A great base for your San Francisco trip.	
Jan 20 2009 	Great value	This hotel provided excellent value. The location is very convenient(just off Union Square), close to museums,shopping and restaurants galore. The room was spacious,included coffee maker and bathrobes. Our rate also included a very adequate continental breakfast.	
Jan 19 2009 	Large rooms great location 	I booked 2 nights at the Donatello to see the new Academy of Science in Golden Gate Park. Best Deal was to call them directly and book through Shell Resorts who own the property. We stayed in a King Deluxe with a foldout sofa bed. It had some nice extra ammenities, like a little mini stereo, microwave, fridge, a wet bar with plates, glasses, as well as some basic cutlery, bottle opener, cereal bowls, etc. The room had space and was very comfortable. The head concierge, Peter was just GREAT and seemed well connected with most of the wonderful S.F. restaurants. He recommended 2 in the area that were very unusual and superb (Saha &amp; another Asian fusion restaurant). The continental breakfast on the top Club floor is very adequate and there is the Club balcony to sit out on for the great S.F. air, As other travellers have noted, the location is ideal--a block from Union Square, a block from the cable car line, and a few blocks from Chinatown by foot. We took the #71 bus to Golden Gate park and then took the &quot;N&quot; trolley car back ; received a discount at the Academy of Science for taking public transportation.All of the staff helped make our stay very pleasant, and we remarked as we were driving home over the Bay Bridge today that we had a truly exceptional stay in the City. I also want to thank Rolando for the printed directions to get us over the Bay Bridge. Again, another great idea!	
Jan 18 2009 	Review of the Donatello	My partner and I stayed at the Donatello in Jan 2009 on a business trip to San Francisco.For a hotel the room was a good size with the addition of a microwave, toaster, fridge and coffee machine. The room was big enough to have a 2 seater couch which was nice to sit and relax in at the end of the day.Location is within easy walking distance to the central shopping district and public transport. Club lounge area was a nice addition to a standard corporate style city hotel. Breakfast offerings were lacking in variety of healthy food choices. We decided to find alternative options to breakfast although it was included in the cost of our package.Attention to detail in cleaning the rooms was a little lacklustre.	
Jan 17 2009 	Truly Exceptional Location Service and Value for $$	I booked a night at the Donatello in order to spend a little time in the city with my Mom and a friend, mainly to take in a show at Yoshi's. The main idea was to stay in someplace decent and safe, not far from the new Yoshi's at Fillmore and Eddy. The hotel really exceeded my expectations. We stayed in a King Deluxe with a foldout sofa bed. It had some nice extra ammenities, like a little mini stereo, microwave, fridge, and wine and champagne glasses, as well as some basic cutlery, bottle opener, cereal bowls, etc. The room had space and was very comfortable. The small workout room was great, and the jacuzzi and sauna were very pleasant. Plenty of little touches (like toiletries in the locker room by the sauna and a little jar of hard candy in the room) show that the hotel is thinking of their guests. As other travellers have noted, the location is ideal--a block from Union Square, a block from the cable car line, and a few blocks from Chinatown by foot. All the staff at the hotel were attentive and helpful, and I don't think we passed anyone who didn't great us with a smile and a hello. Special thanks to Jesus and Rolando, and the Concierge at Club level. They helped make our stay very pleasant, and we remarked as we were driving home over the Bay Bridge today that we had a truly exceptional stay in the City. BTW, if Rolando is looking at this, thanks for the printed directions to get us over the Bay Bridge. Again, another great idea--probably the hotel gets asked this question dozens of times a day, and printing the directions on a card makes perfect sense!	
Jan 5 2009	Fantastic for families!	We stayed at the Donatello with our fourteen-month-old, and we found it excellent. This is a terrific hotels for families. The location--one block from Union Square--is superb. There is a mini-kitchen with fridge, microwave, dishes etc, which helps a lot. There is a decent amount of space. They provided a nice wooden crib (not a travel one), and everyone, from the front desk staff to the bellmen to the cleaning staff, was helpful and kind throughout our stay. Given the location, the prices were quite reasonable. With young children, it is best to ask for a high-floor room (ours was on the 10th floor), away from the street. There are more glamorous (and expensive) hotels in SF, but this one, cozy and friendly and well-located, suited our needs perfectly. I recommend it highly.	
Dec 16 2008	A Pleasant Time in San Francisco	We just came back from a three-day and two-night vacation in San Francisco. My brother, his wife, and I stayed at the Donatello and we all had an excellent experience at the hotel. First, we were impressed by the professional attitude, the graciousness, and the willingness of the staff to assist the guests; and second, the hotel accommodations were outstanding with clean and comfortable beds, well-kept carpets, and ample supply of towels and linens. The free breakfast that the hotel provides is more than sufficient to provide nutrition and energy for the San Francisco visitor who has to walk up and down the hills to see this beautiful city. Overall, I am happy that I chose this hotel for our visit to San Francisco and I highly recommend The Donatello!	
Dec 13 2008 	Best in SF -	You won't find a better hotel than The Donatello. Great rooms with everything you need- refrigerator, micro, safe, HD Tv - (about 100 channels). room are bright, clean and something that feels warm and friendly when you first enter and every time you come back. The staff is the best - had answers to every question and catered to every need. Unless you feel a need to spend $ 400 at one of those high end hotels stay here. Forget Nob Hill (lousy location) forget the Wharf (great place to visit not not to stay). This is the place and we are very selective.	
Dec 9 2008 	Simple things done well.	Stayed at the Donatello for 8 nights in November 08 and have little or no complaints. A lick of paint is needed in a few places but otherwise this hotel is fine. Good staff and service and a prime location for downtown (although everywhere else can be reached by foot, taxi, MUNI or BART). But the real winner is the large rooms. These are a real bonus. If you hate hotels rooms where to seem to just bounce from wall to furniture to wall, then this is the place for you. Rooms had all the cons one wants and needs. The simple breakfast offered in the Club Floor is adequate and suited our tastes. The Club floor is small and not a formal dining area, so a lot of folks (I think) chose to eat elsewhere  there are plenty of Diners nearby. In all, the breakfast arrangement is very low-key, offers a gentle start to the day and is a breath of fresh air compared to the noisy dining halls at similar sized hotels. Finally, we did not hear one other British accent during our stay at this hotel  what joy!	
Dec 3 2008 	Great San Francisco experience	We recently stayed at the Donatello over Thanksgiving with some friends from Oregon. Contributing to our wonderful time in San Francisco were the comfortable accommodations we enjoyed at the Donatello. Our rooms (which were the same) were large, clean, and contained all of the amenities one would expect from this caliber of hotel including a refrigerator, microwave, coffee maker, and a small sink. The staff was very congenial and ready to meet our every request with eagerness. The morning continental breakfast consisting of many food choices was delightful and more than sufficient to prepare us for our day's excursion. We have stayed at the Donatello before so we felt comfortable inviting guests to join us this time, and they enjoyed their experience as much as we did. We look forward to returning in the near future.	
Dec 2 2008 	Wonderful rooms and beds at the Donatello	We have just completed a one week stay at the Donatello, and loved it. The rooms are large and clean, and the beds (king size) are superbly comfortable! The colour scheme is royal blue and orange - it sounds weird, but it really works. The bathrooms are good, and there is good storage space in the bathroom and the room in general. Rooms have a microwave, fridge, coffee maker, dishes and cutlery - tea, coffee and sugar are supplied.The staff, especially Jesus, couldn't have been more helpful and friendly.The only problem we had was noise from the nightclub on Mason St, but Jesus moved us to another room, and then all was well. Don't stay in a room overlooking Mason!The restaurant is wonderful, but not cheap.	
Dec 1 2008 	Great staff fantastic location	We stayed at the Donatello from Oct. 27 to Nov. 4 of this year; our second time at this hotel. LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION you cant get any better than this hotel! It is one short block to Union Square (5-minute walk), and is a perfect base for San Francisco, near all the sites and shopping places. It is also a safe place to be, and we had no worries walking around the area at night. A huge Borders is practically across the street (2-minute walk), and is open till very late. For meals, we enjoyed Sears (right beside Borders), which has the best pancakes in the city.Considering the hotel is right in the heart of the city, the room was very spacious, with a small kitchenette that had a fridge, microwave, coffeemaker. This was in addition to a king-sized and very comfortable bed and large sofa bed, TV and video player. A major factor for return guests is that the staff is exceptional: friendly, helpful, knowledgeable. Special mention must go to Mark San Felipe, whom you could always rely on to give you the best tips for places to go for meals and shopping. Whether early morning or very late at night, the front desk staff was unfailingly approachable, and this made our stay very pleasant indeed. In fact, Jet Blue lost my luggage on our first night there, and the hotel staff did all it could to help and assure me; looking up the necessary phone numbers, with Mark advising me on the best way to deal with the problem. His advice proved very useful, as I was able to pick up my luggage from the airport the next day, instead of relying on Jet Blue to deliver it to me at the hotel (and risk the luggage being misplaced again!)There is no other place Ill stay in when in San Francisco.	
Nov 19 2008 	Ah the Donatello - I want to live there	The hotel is elegant yet personable. The staff were uniformly helpful and professional. The room and common areas were clean, modern, and lovely. The lounge and rooftop sitting area were luxurious touches. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay, and would stay there again. I was shocked to be treated to such elegance for such a budget price.	
Nov 14 2008 	Spacious room but lots of street noise	Overall we enjoyed the hotel but there were a couple of quirks, some of which we knew about going in. When we checked in, it was a little earlier than their regular time and the room was ready. We were not asked which side of the hotel we wanted or if we had a floor preference (other guests were asked those questions when they checked in later). Possibly this was the only room available at the time so it is understandable. Our room was on the sixth floor overlooking Post St. The street noise on Friday and Saturday nights was very bad, but ear plugs helped. The room was very large and that was a big plus. Know what you are getting into if you sign up for the Timeshare sell. Keep your resolve if you just want the free gift. We also wondered about the spa facilities. Several people we ran into were not guest members and it seemed as if they just wanted a shower. Anyone could enter as you didn't need your key to open the facilities.	
Nov 13 2008 	too noisy	The hotel generally was nice, room was adequate, the bathroom needed some TLC, Breakfast was ok, however there was only a coupe of tables in the &quot;dining room&quot; &amp; it got crowded very quickly,but the biggest down fall was the street noise, one on the bedroom windows did not close properly &amp; the hotel is on a main emergency services route &amp; as a result we didn't get much sleep at night from all the sirens,	
Nov 11 2008 	Great Experience	The Donatello is a true San Francisco gem, tucked away only one block from Union Square. The property itself is staffed by friendly, knowledgable staff. They welcome your questions and are there to make your stay enjoyable. When booking, I suggest you request a high floor to negate at least part of the street noise. Our room was spacious, especially by the San Francisco standard. It had a small refrigerator which proved quite useful. The flat screen television and DVD player were both nice touches.The carpet showed no signs of stains while the furniture did show a few nicks and minimal guest trauma. The bed linens were of moderate, hotel quality. The bed itself was fairly comfortable. The robes provided were quite plush and of very good quality.The hotel offers nightly turn down service which was very nice. If you would like to opt out of it simply place the &quot;do not disturb sign&quot; on your door. If you want ice you will have to call the Bell Captain for complimentary delivery, no ice machines here. Both times we requested ice it was delivered within five minutes.Housekeeping was prompt and did an excellent job. No surprises upon our return to the room.Room service is limited. The only food items offered are from Zingari Restaurant which is on site. (**I do not recommend this restaraunt** please check the reviews before going)The concierge can recommend a restaraunt if you're not familiar with the area. They are very apprachable at the Donatello, not &quot;snooty&quot; in the least.At fourteen stories in height, don't expect a stellar city scape view though. We were in the midst of surrounding buildings, all seemed to be taller than ours.The Club level is on the fifteenth floor which will offer you some great views of the area. It has a comfortable feel to it, including a fireplace and offering self-service coffee and teas. You will also fing a hotel concierge there in addition to the concierge located in the lobby. If you're looking for an intimate, service oriented, upscale but unpretentious property in San Francisco. I would have to say that you won't be dissapointed here, I know we weren't.	
Nov 11 2008 	Pleasant place 	The Donatello is a medium-size hotel which is a just a few minutes walk from Union Square. We decided that wed probably prefer this area to Fishermans Wharf, and we were glad we made that choice.This is a well-run place. The rooms were nicely furnished, the bathroom was small-ish but adequate, and it was clean. Staff members all seemed very pleasant and efficient.A really big plus is that the Donatello provides free wi-fi access. After experiencing some rip-off charges elsewhere, we appreciated the gesture.The breakfast in the top floor Club Room is a great deal, but the room is too small to cope with demand and so its either balance your bagel on your lap or take it back to your room.There was a limited view of high-rise buildings from our room  as youd expect in the city centre. Also, there is a very popular night club just across the road, so there was some noise in the early hours as people were leaving. There are some other lively bars and a few nice restaurants in the area - although it is mainly a shopping location.The hotels piano bar is pleasant, and offers very reasonably-priced drinks.The Donatello proved a good value deal in the heart of the city.	
Nov 10 2008 	Nice Especially for the price!	We chose the Donatello as we were staying in San Francisco for a week-long trip to attend a wedding. We booked here after looking around the web for quite a while, trying to find a hotel room in the right price range and yet also big enough for our stay. My husband and I were traveling with our 9-month old baby and needed a room large enough to fit a crib off to the side. The Donatello fit the bill perfectly. It is not the most luxurious hotel room I have ever been in, and the bathroom was a bit on the duller side, but it is clean, large (ESPECIALLY for SF), and pretty well appointed. There was even a little foyer area where we could put the crib so that our baby could sleep in the quiet dark while we had some lights on in the room. It might not be what you're looking for in a honeymoon suite, but it's a perfect fit for a business trip, a nice little get-away on a budget or a family vacation. Our hotel room was NOTHING like what the previous user's was like, with mold and peeling paint. If it were, we would not have stayed. The crib DID seem a little old and I will warn you to BRING YOUR OWN CRIB SHEET! The crib sheet was so big and loose it was a potential suffocation hazard and we did marvel that the hotel was risking a lawsuit, not to mention a child accident. Fortunately, we had own own. We really appreciated the sideboard with the empty refrigerator and the sink. It helped a lot with being able to bring in food, keeping formula and the washing and rinsing of the baby bottles. The hotel staff was friendly and helpful and quite willing to put up with our check-in confusion. The maids did a terrific job everyday. One problem: The walls are somewhat thin. We could not hear other people for the most part, but my mother stayed in the room next to ours and, when the baby was having a particularly fussy night, my mother could hear her crying. Short of a screaming baby, however, not a lot of noise gets through. And, as we didn't receive any complaints, we're assuming it wasn't horrible for other guests. But to any other guests out there, we apologize if it were. Overall, this hotel did a good job of meeting our family's needs.	
Nov 7 2008 	A good choice	My husband and I recently returned from a week in California. We stayed 3 nights at The Donatello in San Francisco. We found the hotel to be a good choice for us. The room was extremely nice; large and well equipped. There was a wine and cheese party the afternoon we arrived (Friday) which is a once-a-week event. This took place on the top floor where the complimentary continental breakfast was offered every morning. Staff was very friendly and helpful, as other reviewers have noted. Housekeeping standards were high. The location, while convenient to Union Square, public transportation, etc., was sort of on the fringe, and you didn't want to wander too far or you'd be in a pretty seedy area.	
Nov 4 2008 	Pretty faultless	This is a nice hotel. It's quite large and very centrally located being a stone's throw from Union Square. But it's not too large and impersonal. The staff were helpful and geuninely interested in giving us a good time (we stayed two nights) and managed to remember our names and where we came from during conversation over consecutive days we gave all of the right impressions. Out room was quite well appointed with a wet bar and microwave oven and a very large, very comfortable bed but - in all fairness - wasn't overly cute or romantic. But then that wasn't really it's brief. We wanted a fairly central, quite businesslike hotel with location and facilities more important than 'soul' and that's what we got, with personal service and a degree of attention to detail thrown in for good measure.Worth a revisit.	
Nov 4 2008 	There must be two Donatellos in SF	We stayed at the Donatello hotel for 4 nights in October 2008. We chose it based on the the reviews in TripAdvisor. I am really amazed to re-read some of the comments that people have made, now that I have been at the hotel. What are they talking about? Is there another hotel Donatello in SF? This is a nice hotel? A nice lobby? There is hardly any lobby at the hotel and it is as simple as your can imagine. People who wrote that must have been sitting in the the lobby of the JW Marriott across the street and not the Donatello. As far as the beautiful rooms, maybe we just got unlucky and got a bad room but we checked other rooms from outside while the doors were opened for cleaning and they all looked basically the same. I have lived in SF for many years so I know the area and was not surprised by all the beggars and other bad and ugly elements that show up, mostly late at night, in that area. What I did not expect was to stay in such a disgusting room with paint peeling and mildew. The people at the reception are very nice but were totally ineffective. We arrived at the hotel two hours before the check-in time. Jesus, who somebody recommended for a review and a raise, and maybe he deserves it, welcomed us and checked us in. He took our mobile number and said that he will try to have us checked in as soon as possible and will call us when the room is ready. We never received the call and upon our return to the hotel we found out that the room was ready but that they forgot to call us - no big deal. What was a concern to us was the fact that the concierge could not find our luggage. It took him several minutes to realize that his colleague has left them in a conference room near the lobby - the door to that room was unlocked and anybody could have entered the room and take the luggage from there. With our hearts still pounding we took the elevator (dirty and in need of renovation) to the ninth floor. Our room was away from the street, which is highly recommended in this area, with a view of a car rental place and some other shady hotels and apartments in the same block - just next to the ice-maker and the door to the maintenance room - not such a big deal unless you want to sleep late in the morning. The worse part was the bathroom - SEE some pics attached. I called the &quot;effective&quot; and nice people at the reception and asked to speak to the manager. &quot;no problem - he will get back to you very soon&quot;. I called 3 times and left 3 messages and I never received a call back from the manager. I can go on with other examples of how ineffective the staff is  but nice  but all I can say is that I will never stay there again, not even for free.	
Oct 29 2008 	The great combination of value comfort service and location	We just spent a week at the Donatello, a clean, spacious and well-located hotel very close to Union Square. Our room was perhaps twice the size of a standard city room, and considerably less expensive. With the friendly service, included continental breakfasts and internet access, it's difficult to imagine how the Donatello could do things better. We'd happily return.	
Oct 27 2008	good and bad	Service was amazing. Jesus who runs the front desk deserves a raise. Was very upfront about everything and very helpful.However... our problem with the place was in the rooms themselves. The bed is quite possibly the most uncomfortable hotel bed i have ever slept on. We stayed in an Embassy Suites the night before... and the bed was better and the breakfast selection the next day was better.The hotel has a great location though... right near all the shops at Union Square. Conceirge was great about helping us get around town for cheap.	
Oct 27 2008 	I Absolutely Loved the Donatello	I stayed at the Donatello Hotel for our recent trip to San Francisco California and let me tell you, It has to be one of the BEST hotels I have ever stayed in. The staff there was EXTREMELY nice, and had some of the best if not THE BEST customer service ever. They greet you with smiles on their faces and are so polite, they genuinely do make you feel very welcome. Anytime we needed something, we would call housekeeping and we would have someone knocking on our door in literally less than 5 minutes. They are so attentive and will help you in any way. They're just great. I am planning to go back to San Francisco very soon, and will definitely plan on staying at the Donatello hotel again.	
Oct 24 2008 	I will stay at the Donatello again	The rooms at the Donatello are comfortable, practical, and attractive. The staff is helpful and pleasant. Breakfast is a buffet continental repast--the room gets crowded but the food is quite fresh. I was there for 12 nights and don't have a single criticism of the hotel, except for the crowded breakfast room.The restaurant attached to the hotel, however, is quite mediocre and very noisy, with unresponsive staff. Avoid it.	
Oct 17 2008 	Nice renovation Great Suite	I have been frequenting this hotel on and off for the last few years but have been missing since the renovation of the &quot;presidential suite&quot; which I booked for a week-end with my wife.Although the tenderloin with its usual mix of bohemians and bums remains near and unchanged (the Hotel is one block from Union Square Shopping and the Theater District) I enjoyed seeing again the same faces (Miguel the parking attendant is becoming an icon) and enjoyed the friendly atmosphere of the hotel .The check-in was a bit slow but I enjoyed my free apple while waiting. The elevators are also a bit slow but adequate most of the times.The suite was completely renovated, the living room and dining room now have polished wood floors and the living rooms has an enormous (I think 50&quot;) plasma HD.Rugs adorn all the rooms and the walls look freshly painted.The decor doesn't match the rest of the hotel because they picked a classic &quot;elegant&quot; look with heavy draperies and antique prints on the wall but makes you feel at home and pampered.I guess they have not renovated the kitchen as it was locked and not available during my stay.All and all I had a great time and would reccomend it.	
Oct 14 2008 	Big rooms nice service	Great location, big room, very nice hotel staff and excellent rate! Everyone that works there was always very pleasant and curteous. It's just a block or two from Union Square which is great for shopping. Also very close to the BART. Fisherman's warf is a little further but not a bad walk (as long as you go along more flatter streets, like Kearny).During my stay in San Fran, I also stayed at the Hilton Financial District for 4 nights. I personally preferred the location of the Hilton only because I really liked Columbus street with all the Italian restaurant cafes. But overall, I felt the Donatello was a much better place to stay. Certainly not as poshy and trendy as the Hilton but very clean and nice and closer to more stuff to do. They also have a rooftop patio thing which is kind of cool (only went to see it, didn't really enjoy it much).	
Oct 14 2008 	Comfortable Modern and Well Located	Hotels near Union Square tend to fall into 2 categories: ultra posh and very expensive or less-expensive &quot;character&quot; buildings that have been nicely restored but are still old buildings with small rooms and no A/C . The Donatello is one of the few that doesn't fit into either category.The hotel is a 1960s-ish building with big rooms, fitness center and modern elevators. Rooms have king-size beds plus a queen sofa-bed, new (but not fancy) furniture, A/C and a big LCD TV and DVD player. A real bonus was the small kitchenette in our room with microwave, empty bar fridge (who drinks those minis anyway?), bar sink, and supplies including wine glasses, plates, cutlery, cutting board and corkscrew. Our room rate also included continental breakfast each morning.It is clean and the staff are super nice. We did have a few small problems: there was no bedding for the sofa bed even though our reservation clearly specified we were a party of 3; and the latches on the aluminum frame casement windows were so worn that the windows would not latch closed. Both of these problems were cheerfully corrected by the staff  they even sent someone up from the engineering department to show me how to work the DVD player.Like virtually all of San Francisco, noise is a problem if youre a light sleeper. Upon check-in we requested a room on the highest floor available (10th of 14) and the light sleepers in our group of 3 women slept with ear plugs.We had a pleasant and comfortable stay at this well-located hotel. I would certainly stay there again.	
Oct 14 2008 	Donatello Was Great	We only stayed here 3 nights but I wish it could have been more. We arrived long before check in time but our room was ready and after flying from the East coast it was fabulous to get into our room. The room was large, great comfy bed and plenty of room. The hotel is also a timeshare so the guests probably stay longer and need the microwave, wet bar etc. I couldn't believe we got a smoking room in California (husband is a smoker - please no lectures) but the windows in the room could open so he would smoke right near the window so the room would be spared. No view to speak of but fresh air!The location right at Union Square was so convenient to everything.A continental brakfast is available on the club level and it was free with our room or is $4.00 - coffee, etc. fruit, danish bagels - more than enough for us. The bar - next to the restaurant is very nice and has an extended happy hour each day - very nice at the end of the day after walking the hills of San Francisco. I'd go back to the Donatello in a minute.	
Oct 13 2008 	Great Hotel and location	C.Schuddeboom, Lords Valley,PA.September 2008The hotel is in a perfect location. One block from Union Square and 3 block for ChinaTown. The service was excellent. The hotel was clean ,bright and cozy. We had one of the seven terrace rooms and definitely worth trying for.The room was large,very comfortable and has A/C. Loved the wet bar,microwave,refrig,dishes,glasses and silverware.We celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary and , when told, the hotel sent up a bottle of wine and chocalates.Nice touch.	
Oct 12 2008 	Had Everything We Needed	My husband and I stayed at the Donatello from October 8 through October 12. I booked the hotel on their website and paid from $159 (Wed., Thurs. through $199 (Sat.) for our stay. I found this to be a reasonable price judging from websites I checked prior to our trip. We stayed on the 8th floor close to the elevators and never once heard the sounds from anyone in the hall. There was a wall of windows fronting Post street, and we loved having the natural light with the curtains open. Perhaps we're heavy sleepers, but with the windows closed and the air on, we slept very well. One night that I left the windows open, I was disturbed by the trash collection going on early in the morning. We tried out the new jacuzzi in the workout area and had a great time. We were the only ones using the tub, and using a tip learned here on TripAdvisor, I set the timer on the womens' sauna before entering the jacuzzi so that the sauna would be nice and hot after our soak in the jacuzzi. Unfortunately for me, either I don't know how to use the sauna or it was broken. Either way, I was disappointed. My husband had a great 15 minutes in the mens' sauna and wanted to return every evening.We only had the free continental breakfast only once during our four night stay. It seemed to be very carb heavy with lots of donuts and bagels, and not what we normally have for breakfast so we decided to go out all other times. There are many diners, and coffee shops nearby in any direction. You will definitely find something to eat.I appreciated the free San Francisco Chronicle and US Today available, and also the coffee and tea available throughout the day.I would definitely recommend this property as a good middle of the road hotel with very large rooms in San Francisco. If you want to spend more money for luxury then you should do so. This is a nice property for under $200 per night in a wonderful location near Union Square and near all the cable car lines. I definitely give it an enthusiastic thumbs up!	
Oct 10 2008 	Just Wonderful	Stayed 4 nights end of September into October. All requests were honored - no smoking, room in rear, and adjacent room next to other family members. Very efficient and courteous staff.Rooms were very large with small efficiency kitchen - refrigertor, microwave, sink, toaster, &amp; coffee. Very clean and nicely furnished. Free Wi-fi connections and access to computer and printer in lobby. Location was perfect - only a couple of blocks to Union Square and near all transportation. Nice little walk into China town also.Hotel served a continental breakfast with bagels, croissants, and pastries and some fruit each morning in the roof top lounge which was plenty to get us started for the day of touring. Hotel also had a gym with sauna but unfortunately we never had time to use it. Hotel also has a nice restaurant and bar area which offers half-priced apertizers during &quot;Happy Hour&quot;. Great hotel at a great price. I would highy recommend this hotel.	
Oct 9 2008 	Well worth a stay!!	Stayed Sep/Oct 2008.The Donatello was exactly what we read on TA. We were delighted with our room which on advice from TA we were given the 10 floor to the back of the Hotel. Very quiet, as over the week ends due to a night club across the road, any lower im sure the crowds would disturb your sleep.The Room was a fine size and felt very homely indeed. It was always kept very clean and we used the laundry vacillates which we would highly recommend and again like the hotel very good value. The staff were so friendly all the time and anytime you asked for anything they couldnt have been more cooperative and helpful. Thats the way to run a hotel!The Continental Breakfast was a waste of time, sticky doughnuts covered in icing sugar and thats if you were there well before 9 in the morning, if not there was nothing left?? Were supposed to be on vacation what was the rush. We had breakfast out most mornings. The woman who was running it very unfriendly was even rude to customers on occasions. The ZINGARI Restaurant and Piano Bar and Lounge, overlooking Downtown San Francisco through grand windows of Hotel Donatello is the best and the bar manager Mari is one in a million. She made the place for us, most nights we would go down to the bar and have a few drinks and Mari couldnt have been more welcoming. Always a good laugh and plenty of chat at the bar! Dont miss Amanda King the in-house Jazz Singer, great voice and wonderful personality. If your there tell Mari(Mary) that Hugh and Chris say high!! All in all this is a little gem in SF and great value.	
Oct 6 2008 	Fantastic Service great location	A Block away from Union square at a reasonable price? I found it hard to believe.... but it was true. The Donatello is a comfortable hotel in a great location with a great staff.The Room was very clean and comfortable, with Microwave oven, toaster and fridge for storing small snacks. From our seventh floor room we could hear no road noise. Great selection of TV channels (No PPV).	
Oct 6 2008 	Donatello Rocks...	We just had a wonderful visit to San Fran which included 2 nights at the Donatello. What a great Boutique style hotel!!!! Our room was large and the bed was really nice. Reminded of our bed at home..Location perfect a block from Union Square..The staff was excellent and very helpful. Sarah the concierge hooked us up with a fabulous Italian restaurant &quot;Fino&quot; 2 blocks from the hotel. Fino is a small romantic place with nothing over 27$$$. The food and service were exceptional!!!! Great Combo...The Donatello &amp; Fino	
Oct 4 2008 	Great Hotel - Excellent Location	28Sep-4Oct08: CHECK-IN: We arrived at the hotel at about 2pm on Sunday and checked in quickly with no problems. Based on TA advice we requested, previous to our arrival, a room on the highest floor and on the backside of the hotel to get away from the noise. We were given room 1011 (Floors 12 &amp; 14 are apparently VIP/expensive rooms). Our view was poor as expected, but with the AC on, we never heard any noise at night, and very little during the day. Loved it. After getting information on activities, we were given an offer to see Muir Woods free if we sit through an information spiel updating us on using our benefits. No thanks!The ROOM was an ugly orange and blue as expected, but was spacious and comfortable with enough space to put away our clothes and stuff with ease. 30x 20 refrigerator, small microwave, toaster, coffee maker, condiments, a couple plates, cups and silverware; nice 34-36 widescreen TV, DVD player, mini music center; USA Today every morning with the San Francisco Chronicle available in the lobby. INTERNET: We used it everyday and never experienced any problems. The BATHROOM was a little smaller than expected. Only 5x8 including the tub/shower combo. The whole room is well planned, except for the waste of space across from the bathroom. If the room entrance had been moved from the center, the bathroom could have been at least 50% larger. The toilet flushed very loud.The BED was reasonably comfortable, but a little hard. We are spoiled with a foam mattress at home. We ended up putting the extra sofa sleeper sheets from the closet on top of the bedding/comforter, and then covering ourselves with the extra sheet and blankets. We then slept more comfortably.CONTINENTAL BREAKFAST: See pics - Reg &amp; Nonfat milk/various coffees &amp; teas/tasty OJ; good donuts/pastries/muffins; bananas/apples/oranges; bagels/cream cheese/butter/jams; Many TA folks have complained about the breakfast. Perhaps some do not understand that this is a classic continental breakfast  not a buffet. Nonetheless, how hard is it to add little cereal boxes? And regardless of anything else, we are in the year 2008 and it is just very poor not to have yogurt, which is a staple of quick breakfasts today. If you get in there in the first hour, food selection is fine. After that, the selection diminishes quickly. The selection also seemed to diminish during the week from Monday to Thursday, but then Friday and Saturday were decent. Outside there were 2 tables with 4 &amp; 2 chairs, and also 2 lounge chairs. With a light jacket it is very nice to enjoy your meal outside. Inside there are 4 café tables with 3 chairs each, and also 4 sofa chairs and one sofa. Seating is hit and miss after about 7:30am. We ate there a couple of times, otherwise we just brought our food back to the room. FITNESS CENTER: Very minimal EQUIPMENT: 1 stair stepper, 1 stationary cycle, 1 treadmill, set of free weights; meager universal machine, scale and water dispenser. Small but adequate separate SAUNAS. You may need to turn it on and then wait 15 minutes or more for it to warm up as I did on all 3 occasions I used it. The aluminum JACUZZI is brand new and a bit small. The first time I could barely fit in with several other people in it. The next 2 occasions, there was never more than 1 other person. They have towels, locker room, showers etc. LOCATION IS EXCELLENT! Just a block from Union Square and 5 blocks from Powell and Market. You can get half-price tickets at TIX in Union Square for numerous plays, comedy clubs and entertainment venues. 1 block from Biscuits &amp; Blues where we listened to some great blues. Ruby Skye club across the street.1 1/2 blocks from Colibri Mexican Restaurant which was great. 1 1/2 blocks from the American Conservatory Theater which is a very nice theater where we saw Rock n Roll.1 1/2 blocks from the Curran Theater which was a decent theater in which we saw Spring Awakening. 1 Block from Honey Honey Café &amp; Crepery which is great for a sandwich or burger and excellent for an omelet or a crepe. Innumerable eating, shopping and entertainment establishments very close by. MASSAGE 4 blocks from the Union Square Stress Reduction Center (on Sutter before Kearny) where we both got an excellent massage for $50 per hour  if you dont want to spend a ridiculous $105 per hour at this hotel. If your calves hurt like ours, this was almost a necessity.IF YOU WALK places like we love to do, and you are here for more than a couple days, we highly suggest that you take the cable car or buses when going upward or downward. We both jog/walk a couple times a week. Nonetheless, walking up and down the hills now and then during our stay caused both of us significant and unusual discomfort in our legs and shins after a couple of days. We used the sauna and Jacuzzi only 3 times, but we needed to use it every single day. TRANSPORTATION: Unless you are traveling away from San Francisco, driving is completely unnecessary and probably frustrating. Public transportation is fun and inexpensive. The MUNI pass is only $24 for seven days. We highly recommend the City Pass for $59 which includes the 7-day MUNI pass and the $25 admission to the California Academy of Sciences (a MUST SEE!), a 1-hour bay cruise which is cool, and a few other good attractions. Last year we stayed at the Le Meridien Hotel on Battery Street near Embarcadero Plaza and Pier 1. It is a better hotel with a great location too. However, given a choice of the two at the same price, we would stay at the Donatello because the location is the best, and the free internet which we used to explore SF every day.	
Oct 4 2008	Well worth it	Me and my wife stayed in the Donatello in Sept 2008 and it was a great start to our California holiday. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the room was large, bright, clean and comfortable. Really god bed too, which is important to us. I used the gym a couple of times which is a little small but functional. Unlike some other reviewers, we didn't have any problems with noise from the street even though it was Friday and Saturday and we could see the entrance to a nightclub from our 15th floor window.The only negative is the breakfast. It's fine if you're happy with coffeee, croisants, bagels, fresh fruits and gooey gunky sweet muffins, but the breakfast room itself is very small and nowhere near able to seat all the guests who come in so most ended up taking their breakfasts to their rooms to eat. Again, fine if you don't mind doing that but something to be aware of.Location is very good and it seems quite critical. We popped over to look at the Hotel California which is only a couple of blocks away and one we were considering staying at. But those couple of blocks make a big difference. The neighbourhood takes a swift dive for the worse into a world of liquor stores and downbeat people hanging out on corners. Not exactly romantic. But the area immediately around the Donatello is fine.Overall then, a very nice hotel for the price and in a great location.	
Oct 3 2008 	Felt welcome	This was my second stay at the Donatello. They made me feel welcome which is very nice of a hotel. All the staff were friendly and professional making the stay a pleasure. The continuental breakfast provided with the room was good but could have used more varieties of fruit. If you want to stay in downtown San Francisco this is the place to stay if your looking for a good room at a reasonable price. The only draw back is that they only have one bed in each room making it dificult to bring the family.	
Sep 30 2008 	The Best	We have stayed at the Donatello many times. All are stays have been very enjoyable. All the staff are great to deal with and the hotel itself is a very special place to spend an enjoyable weekend in San Francisco. This last say, I must give cudo's to bell man &quot;Carlos&quot;. He helped out with a couple of special situations, beyond the call of duty. Thanks again,Lon McCaslandRedding, Ca.	
Sep 30 2008 	Made a great stay in S.F. even greater!	This was my second stay at The Donatello and they will most certainly get my future business while in San Francisco. Great location, friendly &amp; helpful staff and clean, quiet and beautifully decorated rooms. My wife and I arrived late on a Friday afternoon and after settling into our room, we relaxed on the concierge level &amp; outdoor lounge area to totally enjoy the Friday wine &amp; cheese party which is a tradition at The Donatello. What a way to start our vacation and set the mood for our relaxing and romantic stay in San Francisco!The Donatello provides all the subtle little touches that make your stay just that much more special--morning newspaper, a bowl of apples in the lobby for the guests, free continental breakfast, nightly turn-down service with chocolates on your pillow, access to a computer and, when it was discovered that I was celebrating a birthday during our stay, a gift of a bottle of wine and box of chocolates was sent to our room. The Donatello certainly contributed to the absolute enjoyment of our stay in San Francisco!	
Sep 29 2008 	Would Return to the Donetello	Hotel staff was very accommodating and answered any questions that i had; Location was in very good proximity of the Union Square; Room was clean and well kept.	
Sep 28 2008 	Frisco Find	We stayed at the Donatelo September 24 through 26 and it was excellent! The location of the Hotel is perfect for seeing the sites of San Francisco with out the hassle. Location Location !!. The room was great with all ammenities required including a fridge and micro, flat screen TV mini stereo, Even some dishes! Bathroomwas fine though small compared to some hotels but who needs a huge bath, We liked the fact that windows were huge and opened although our view was not post card quality it didn't matter. We had a king bed and it was very comfortable. Breakfast was so so as there is limited choice juice coffee pasteries and bagels. There was fruit but not as fresh as it could have been. If I can complain about anything its serving food on paper plates and cups. For a hotel of this quality its sub standard, Now I know its picky but I equate eating off paper to dragging your nails across a blackboard! The staff was over the top in helping answer all questions and providing direction and personal favorities for site seeing. There is a night club/restaurant although we did not eat there ( there are numerous places around the hotel) we did go to the club and enjoy the entertainment. On another note when in Frisco do get the 3-day Muni pass do not get the 7-day pass. Do ride all three cable cars. Do not try to catch the the Masson or Hyde line at the bottom of Powel. Do go to Macy's and catch the &quot;F&quot; street car go all the way to Garibaldi Park and ride the Hydye line back or get off at Fishermans wharf and ride the Mason line. Ride the Californiia line in the afternoon so the sun is at your back for pictures looking back to the financial district. Do stay at the Donatello its the best bang for the buck with class.	
Sep 26 2008 	Loved the Donatello!	We stayed at this hotel for 5 nights. We were treated with such friendliness and courtesy by all the staff. The concierge arranged for our rental car and gave us much assistance with our itinerary. The rooms were spacious, clean and very well equipped with refrigerator, microwave and coffee maker. The location is near Union Square, 5 blocks from the Bart train and near MUNI. This hotel is a gem and we will definitely return here on our next trip to San Francisco!	
Sep 25 2008 	Great Hotel 	My boyfriend and I recently stayed at the Donatello in San Francisco for one night. Being that it was our first time to the city we were pleasantly surprised that our hotel researching paid off! The hotel was definitely a little gem, and the staff were above par with being extremely helpful and accommodating to us. The location was only a few blocks from Union Square and all of it's magnificent shopping! And right in the heart of San Francisco's exciting city. All of the hotel staff that we encountered were extremely nice and really made you feel at home and welcome.Thanks Donatello we will definitely stay with you the next time we are in the area!	
Sep 22 2008 	Donatello - Great choice!	Stayed at The Donatello Sept. 14- 20 and we were very happy with our choice of hotel and glad we decided not to stay at Fisherman's Wharf. Hotel is in a good location and 5 mins. walk to the start of the Cable Car to get on at the beginning, and the F Line on Market Street which we used frequently. If you are returning from the waterfront, you get off at Post which is only one block away.Pleasantly surprised at the large size of the room and the amount of drawers and shelves (double closet with safe and 3 drawers at the entrance), also each side of the TV stand opens up to about five shelves. We unpacked completely as we were staying 6 nights and did not have to live out of our suitcase. There is a microwave, toaster, bar fridge, coffee maker, sink and glasses, plates and cutlery provided.Staff were extremely pleasant and helpful with any of our questions. Good continental breakfast included - excellent choice at 7:30 a.m., however by 9:00 a.m., it can be picked over. The coffee maker in the room makes one large coffee, but that wasn't a problem - I just went up each morning and brought two large cups down to the room from the Club Floor. Coffee is available 24 hrs. so if you sleep in, you miss the food but can still get coffee. We were on the street side (facing the Marriott Hotel) and it was somewhat noisy, but we are sound sleepers, and it didn't bother us. If you are a light sleeper, you may want to request a room not facing the street.Several very nice restaurants within walking distance and at all price levels. They have a few smoking rooms, and by contacting the hotel directly, we were able to be assigned a smoking room.For price and location, it is excellent value.	
Sep 21 2008 	Fantastic hotel great location	Great hotel located just off Union Square. Staff were really friendly and helpful and the rooms were large, comfortable and well equipped. My only complaint would be that we were woken at 5.30am on the last morning of our stay by a staff member knocking on the door to deliver our final bill - no idea why they felt the need to do this, as we weren't checking out until 11am! Other than this, I wouldn't hesitate recommending a stay at the Donatello to anyone visiting San Francisco.	
Sep 20 2008 	A well kept secret in the heart of San Francisco	The Donatello was the perfect place to begin our tour of the USA. Finding the hotel was no problem as it is a 5 minute walk from the Powell Street BART stop. 35 minutes from airport to hotel in total.Rooms were large and very comfortable. Staff were friendly, helpful and knowledgeable, and the happy hour in the bar was also very welcome and great value.The rate included a buffet breakfast which is served in the club room on the top floor overlooking the city. A walk to the Embarcadero and Pier 39 is 30 minutes away, so the Donatello is well located.Gordon and Michael	
Sep 8 2008 	Good hotel great location	Good hotel, clean and spacious room, friendly staff and really great location.	
Sep 1 2008 	Good hotel great location friendly staff	We spent 3 nights in San Francisco at the tail end of a trip through California, Arizona and Nevada. We booked a triple room for me, my husband and 15 year old son and we weren't disappointed by the size of our room, which included a massive queen size bed and a comfortable sofa bed and still had loads of room to spare. The room includes a &quot;kitchen area&quot;, which has a microwave, fridge, sink and coffee maker, which was a great addition as we were pretty fed up of eating in restaurants by then. The location is good, just a block from Union Square and a cable car stop. We didn't use the leisure facilities on the Club Floor, although we were given a guided tour by the very friendly staff on duty and it looked fine. The breakfast was basic and limited, but it was complimentary, so no complaints!In general, the staff throughout the hotel were helpful and friendly, which seems to be the norm in San Francisco. We loved it and would definitely make a return trip.	
Aug 31 2008 	Excellent value for money	We stayed at this hotel for four nights. The cost of the stay was the same using various websites or the hotel's own site and cost $100 for a large room as we were travelling with our teenage daughter. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful, including the night staff as we arrived very late after a flight from the UK. The hotel is just a few minutes from Union Square and close a variety of transport links around the city, including the cable car.The room was clean and comfortable. Continental breakfast was included with the price and there was a good selection of breads and pastries. However, if I were to have one complaint it would be that the breakfast room is very small and each morning there were not enough places for people to sit and eat. Many people just picked some things up and took it to their rooms. The coffee was also not always very hot. That being said, I would not hesitate to stay at this hotel again if we visit San Francisco again.One piece of advice for anyone who is picking up a rental car from San Francisco - don't!. We used Alamo and the wait was four hours to get the pre-booked car (although they ran out of cars and we were upgraded). Hertz next door to the hotel also had an extremely long queue of people waiting to pick up a car at mid-day. This is apparently a common problem in the city during the summer. Next time I will pick up a car at the airport.	
Aug 25 2008 	~ È bello!	We checked into The Donatello for 3 nights, August 20-22nd. The hotel is in a great San Francisco location: about 3 blocks from the Street Car turn-a-round on Powell St.; the same distance to the BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) Powell stop; with Trolley Cars and Buses all nearby. Note: a BART ride to SFO (San Francisco International Airport) is 35 minutes, and costs $5.35 one-way. It is only a 7-minute walk to The Donatello. Nice! Also: the AVIS Rental Car Office is only 2 blocks away. Nice! About the hotel . . .Very well-maintained. Nice lobby. Nice front desk staff. Very courteous. Very helpful.Nice, spacious room. Not out-dated at all. Nicely furnished. Microwave. Fridge. Flat-screen TV. Clean, marble bath. Great shower.Small, but nice, exercise room on the Club Floor on 14. Nice lockers for men and women. Sauna. Spa pool. Clean. Well-done.Continental breakfast. One of the best that we have ever had. Anywhere. Fresh coffee. Juice. Rolls. Croissants. Fresh fruit. Well-stocked. Well-replenished. You won't walk away hungry.Negatives: Our room was on the 10th floor. The hotel had an air conditioning proplem on our first night. With the windows open, there was quite a bit of street noise. However, with the windows closed, no problem. And, this IS a city location, folks. Also: the breakfast, which is served on the Club Floor, can get very busy. Very busy. It is served from 7am to 9:30am. Finding a place to sit can be a challenge. An outdoor patio is also available with limited seating. Go for it!! That's it for our &quot;negatives.&quot; No big deal, eh?Summary: The Donatello is a fine hotel, with very nice amenities, priced-right, with a first-class staff in a prime San Francisco location. You should not be disappointed booking The Donatello for a nice visit in one of our country's special cities.Gustare!	
Aug 24 2008 	Comfy Stay and Great Staff	The staff at the Donatello was very professional and friendly during our four night stay. We checked into room 915 which was considered a quiet room. I was afraid that our view would be the wall of another building but luckily we had a half way decent view of the Clift &amp; Hilton hotels a block or two away. To the very left we could also see Ruby Skye nightclub which did get a bit noisy. Being a highly sensitive sleeper, my sound machine has saved me eight nights of noisy street sounds during our SF stay here and another hotel near the wharf area. The room was a good size for the city, the color scheme was very pleasant and furnishings were well done IMO. The room also has a fridge, toaster, microwave oven, cups, dishes and utensils. We were never approached about the time-share but we did bump into a few owners who seemed to really love it here. One couple had been there for three weeks! The bathroom was very clean but could use some updating such as the tub caulking in a few spots showed some &quot;age spots&quot;. So if you are one of those people who is picky about such things, this lovely hotel might not be for you.My complaint is that the shower really sucked (can I use that word?); I felt like I was being shot at by a fire hose! I like a soothing shower after a long day and being shot at by a water canon like shower was VERY unpleasant. Oh, and the toilet flush is quite loud you can actually hear it next door, uh, only the flushing part though, lol. Other than that I would stay here again. Its a great location, the staff welcomes you back each afternoon/evening and it was nice to be able to go to the club at the top floor to have coffee, tea or cocoa. The location is great and the price is pretty good.	
Aug 20 2008 	Great Decor Great Location	We really enjoyed our stay. The bed was good, the room was clean, the shower was nice and strong, and the decor was really cool. The location for site seeing was great, especially if you're into Union Square and Chinatown. The address should really be on Mason Street as the valet car drop off is not on Post. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. We were greeted warmly and when we asked for a remote for the DVD player, there was someone at our door with the remote within minutes. Good free wireless internet. The view isn't much, but that would be expected as this part of town has many high rises. The only weakness they have is in the quality of their continental breakfast...which consisted mainly of bagels and pastries. But there was a large selection of tea and coffee and hot chocolate...so, hey...whatever.We really liked it.	
Jul 26 2008 	Classy Boutique Hotel in San Fran.	San Francisco was the last stage of our trip to California and we stayed at The Donatello from 19th to 24th April 2008. We chose it after studying many hotel reviews and were well pleased with our choice. The hotel has been refurbished in contemporary style. Our room was huge by city standards. We had a microwave, sink unit and tea making facilities. There was also a CD/DVD player and Hi-Fi system. Noise was minimal. The only loudness was the orange colour of the room decor ! A simple continental breakfast of bagels and croissants with preserves was served in the beautifully furnished 'club room' on the top floor. Being close to Market Street and the cable cars for transport and Union Square for dining proved to be big plus points for this hotel. Staff were very friendly and helpful. I would not hesitate to stay here again and recommend it to my friends.	
Jul 16 2008 	Confort in SF	Nice hotel placed a couple of blocks from Union Square. The room are big with microwave, coffe machine, toaster and refrigerator. We recomend it.Gianni + AleItaly	
Jul 15 2008 	Excellent hotel !!!	This was our first visit to San Francisco. We stayed from Jun 27 to jul 3. Our experience was great in the Donatello. Very clean, excellent location, and very customer oriented staff.The hotel is at walking distance to the great union square and many shops, restaurants,bars and even a drug store.The room was clean, confortable, a/c (we never used), and not noisy as other members reported. The bed was great, nice pillows.	
Jul 5 2008 	Largest Rooms in SF	I join the chorus of admirers on TripAdvisor who recommend this hotel for its excellent location, large rooms, consistent service and undeniable value. Our very large, king-bedded room on a high floor featured a clean, small bath with marble surfaces and expectable amenities. We were told that it was on &quot;Club Level,&quot; which may or may not indicate a premium room at a premium price. The bill was still under $200 per night for a last minute booking. Simple complimentary breakfast, helpful concierge, easy transfer by taxi to the airport--we really could not ask for anything more. It lacks the high drama of the Mariott's top-floor lounge, or the Hanging Gardens of Babylon inside the Hyatt's cavernous lobby. But it freed up several hundred dollars that went, instead, toward food, wine, flight and car-rental in San Francisco.	
Jun 16 2008 	A great stay fantastic location	We loved our time here--the central location cannot be beat. One block from the cable car line, and walking distance to tons of restaurants and shops. We did not notice much noise like other reviews mentioned, exept on Saturday night. Quite a few revelers in town for the Memorial Day weekend. The staff were very friendly and helpful, and the free internet booth was a nice extra. The only disappointment was the remodeling of the jacuzzi which made it unavailable, but the beds were very comfortable and we had lots of space in our room.	
Jun 16 2008 	Nice hotel in the center of the city	This was our 3rd trip to San Francisco, but our first stay at The Donatello.We stayed here on 05/21/08 &amp; 05/22/08. We had a room on the 9th floor. The hotel staff was very friendly, courteous and helpful. Our room was very clean. The comforter on the bed was probably the heaviest one I have ever found in a hotel. Room was very bright and colorful. Entertainment center was equipped with a flat panel TV, DVD player and a stereo system. This is older hotel, but in pretty good condition. This hotel is also part of a time share company, which we did not know before hand. The A/C in our room worked, although it worked, it made a low rattling/vibration sound which was a little irritating. Ended up just opening the windows and letting air in at night. It was cool enough that this worked. Since the hotel is right in the middle of the city, there will noise outside all night long.This did not bother me, but did to my partner. Bathroom was OK, but had a great hand held shower attachment. The free continental breakfast left a lot to be desired. Consisted of bagels and doughnuts. No cereal, milk, or anything with protein. We ended up going out for breakfast each morning. Just down Mason St from the hotel there is a Loris Diner &amp; Café Mason. We ate at the Café Mason. Busy, but we got seated in just 5 minutes. Very good food. Very quaint restaurant. The hotel is located on the SW corner of Post St &amp; Mason St. Entrance is on Mason St. Just one block up Post St to Union Square &amp; the Powell cable cars. However, since this is just a short distance from where the cable car starts, they are usually completely full when they get to Post St. Suggest walking down Powell to Market and stand in line to catch the cable cars going towards Fishermans Wharf.	
Jun 7 2008 	Great Hotel with excellent service	We chose the Donatello based on the good reviews on Trip Advisor. We arrived at the hotel around 10.30am after disembarking from a cruise and had requested an early check-in. We were very impressed when the reception staff were clearly expecting us and our room was ready - excellent!The room was just as shown on the website, clean, spacious and very comfortable. The roof terrace is very nice and we made use of the simple continental breakfast which is complimentary. I must add that this area could get very crowded at breakfast but we were there at 7am and had no problems. The hotel is in an excellent location particularly for people who don't want to keep walking up hill to their hotel.We felt that the Donatello gives excellent value for money.	
May 29 2008 	Fantastic Experience	Nowadays it's tough to find a nice hotel with all the amenities in a big city for under $200 a night. Well, the Donatello exceeded all my expectations. The service was prompt, efficient, and friendly. Our room was spacious, very clean, and comfortable. The hotel provided all the services of the large chain, upscale hotels including concierge, bellmen, spa services, etc., but provided a free continental breakfast, free wifi, and free use of the fitness center -- most upscale hotels despite high room rates, also charge additional fees for such services. The only downside that I can think of to this place is that it is also a timeshare, so be wary of the &quot;free wine and cheese reception&quot; on Friday afternoons; it's more of a sales pitch to buy the timeshares. But we were not hassled at all. Also the fitness center is a tad anemic; just three cardio machines and one weight machine -- but like I said, it's free, and there are also men's and women's saunas and a co-ed jacuzzi (though that was out of service when I was there). It's just six blocks from a BART station, and in a great shopping neighborhood (Union Square) and close to Chinatown. Overall, a great stay and I'd recommend it to anyone.	
May 21 2008 	Great Hotel	We loved the Donatello. The staff was Great!!!!! Big and clean room. The room had a microwave and refigerator which really came in handy. The location was perfect. Very safe. Did I say the staff was Great!!!! The only complaint I had was the street noise on the weekend from the club across the street. We had brought ear plugs to be prepared and we slept fine. I would not think twice about staying there again and would recommend it. Make sure you get a top floor away from the club.	
May 18 2008 	Great Service!! We'll be back!!	Glenn the Concierge was great! He planned our whole trip from beginning to end for us hour by hour, dining, theater, sightseeing, everything. It felt as if we saw everything San Francisco had to offer yet still had time to enjoy our vacation. The house keeping was particularly friendly aspecially Thelma and Damaris. Jesus at the front desk always had a witty one-liner which kept my wife and I laughing. To make a long story short, it was the friendly service that goes abouve and beyond that makes The Donatello the best place in Union Square to visit.	
May 15 2008 	Great Hotel ... Bad Tour experience	The Hotel was Great, just don't book your tours through the concierge. We booked one that included Muir Woods and the Wine country. The concierge or hotel uses a tour company called Extranomical Adventusan Fransico. They sent an 8 passenger van and put 15 people in it. It was so bad, we had to get off and not take the tour. The tour company said no refunds because you have to cancel 72 hours in advance.	
May 15 2008 	Great Hotel	Super hotel. Biggest beds and great sized rooms. Really convenient - just a block from Union Square and bars/eateries.	
May 8 2008 	Great Location. Great Price.	Check the hotel website for their Sunday night special. (The closer to the weekend, the lower the price gets as long as they have rooms.) We had a King Suite: King bed (very comfortable), sitting area (couch, chair), entertainment center and wet bar (sink, refrigerator, microwave,coffee maker, real cups and glasses, silverware...) Noise was NOT a problem on Sunday night. Very pleasant and helpful staff.Great location; Easy walking distance to Union Square, Curran Theatre, trolley &amp; more - try Max's restaurant a short block away - more reasonable than the hotel's restaurant and great food (breakfast, lunch and dinner.) The ONLY negative is the decor - I'm talking UGLY! But clean and good quality - so turn out the lights and you have a 3+ star boutique hotel at 1-2 star prices! Beware the &quot;stay &amp; park&quot; deal - we paid $5 more for parking on the package deal than if we had just gone to the hotel and paid the $28 per day parking. (Might want to call the hotel before booking and compare the package to the regular parking at the time.)Enjoy	
May 8 2008	dont take a room over looking Post or Mason	Great Hotel, as previous reviews staff are wonderful and very helpfull, breakfast also had orange juice, bagles (which you could toast) along with pastries, coffee and several types of tea. The biggest down fall the noise from Ruby Skye across the street started @ 11 pm until 2 am finally dozed off and then what I thought was the garbage truck @ 4am woke me up to smashing glass. After laying there for about 15 minutes I got up to take a look to see what the heck was going on but it was not the garbage truck making the noise it was people going through the garbage looking for cans and glass, yes garbage pickers going through the garbage looking for glass and cans and then throwing them into the back of the pick up truck. This went on until just after 5 am and it was loud and we where on the 7th floor corner room, got up to make sure all the windows where closed it was that loud. If the hotel could find a way to sound proof the windows this would resolve the noise issue. Second night (Saturday I slept with the pillow over by head which helped) so if you are a light sleeper like me do not take a room over looking this street ask to be moved right a way. This is the only issue we had, we didnt change rooms as we where only there for 3 nights in total, but now that we know this side of the hotel is loud, we will make sure not to take a room on this side of the street! Great location to everything will be posting a travel tip in the near future	
May 5 2008 	Wonderful amenities	The Donatello is great! The location is perfect, just enough off the beaten path to feel relaxed once you walk away from Market Street crowds. The staff are incredibly friendly and helpful. I love the little kitchenette and the empty fridge. It even had a microwave and toaster in the room, plus plates and glasses. There was a DVD player that was easy to use. The windows had shutters and could be opened. The thermostat worked. I loved the color scheme with the orange wall. The bed and pillows were comfortable. I thought it was an incredible value worth far more than I paid.	
May 5 2008 	Best Hotel of all I've visited	The location of the hotel was great, the staff was great, housekeeping was phenomenal, loved the convenience of hot beverages throughout the day, &amp; noise was not a factor in our room. Enjoyed our stay immensely. We went to San Fran for my birthday, &amp; per suggestions from other reviewers, I called the hotel to let them know that, &amp; requested a room with a balcony. When I got there, I was pleasantly surprised to hear that they were able to honour my request (since there are only a few select rooms with balconies). Asides from the occassional police sirens, we did not hear any noise, perhaps because of the location of the room, &amp; the fact that the weather was cool enough for us to sleep with the windows closed. I did not get a welcome pkg upon arriving, but they called a few days later for us to pick it up. We were too busy to pick it up, so I don't know what's in it. Also, despite other guest's comments, we were never bothered about attending timeshare. The breakfast was nothing special. I say you're better off buying some cereal &amp; milk from Walgreens &amp; eating that each morning than eating their sugary offerings. I am also puzzled @ how they would offer just orange juice, &amp; not a choice of juices in the morning (my boyfriend &amp; I can't have orange juice). I have a bad back, &amp; don't usually like hotel beds, but their bed was only second to the sleep-number beds offered @ other hotels.The location is great, you don't need to rent a car, it is very close to everything. Housekeeping vacuumed, &amp; very thoroughly cleaned our place every day. Even our dishes were washed!Turndown service everynight was lovely to come back to after a long &amp; tiring day of sightseeing.It rained one night, &amp; the hotel lent us an umbrella (just ask front desk)They even gave us a complimentary bottle of wine for my birthday.My boyfriend &amp; I were also @ another hotel on this trip, but enjoyed the Donatello so much more! Tip: If you are an AAA member, check the website of the hotel direct before you book because I found booking direct with them using the AAA discount was cheaper than doing it through on-line travel sites. It was a wonderful hotel, but I guess it best to book with this hotel during low travel season so that you're less likely to get stuck with a bad room.	
Apr 28 2008 	Too noisy for rooms facing street specially on week-ends	We stayed at the Hotel for three nights on April 23rd. The rooms are quite large and have the advantage of a small refrigerator with a sink and a microwave. Nevertheless, only two pillows were supplied and we had to ask for two more. The A/C was not very good but we were able to sleep with the windows closed. On the 3rd night, which was a Friday, we could not sleep at all, with all the street noise (even though we were on the 9th floor). Another couple traveling with us had an inside room and did not hear the noise. The Continental Breakfast was ok, but there are only 4-5 tables which are very rapidly occupied. The breakfast, although ends at 9:30 am, sometimes runs out of food by 9 am.Our valet parking was good, you would call 5 minutes prior to leaving and they had the car ready for you. Our &quot;Welcome Package&quot; was never presented to us upon registration, as they are supposed to do - only got a call two days later to have us pick it up - which we did not do. The staff is very friendly and warm. The proximity to Union Square and to Powell Street makes it very convenient for shopping and transportation.	
Apr 25 2008 	Greatest Stay!!!!	My wife and I have traveled to numerous locations throughout the US and Mexico. I have to say that The Donatello is the greatest hotel we have been to. The staff was excellent, especially the front desk and the concierge. I have read numerous reviews and want to dispel the rumor that it was &quot;noisy&quot;. Yes there is a club across the street and maybe room location has something to do with it but we slept every night with the windows open and were not bothered one bit by the noise. We are returning to the Donatello in two weeks and would never think of staying any where else in San Fran!	
Apr 21 2008	Very Noisy	Despite reading a previous review about noise we took a chance. The hotel is very well located- a block from Union Square. The rooms are clean and freshly decorated. Everyone on staff was friendly and competent.Just one significant problem- the noise. We were on the 9th floor (too high to hear anything we thought?) About 10PM to midnight on both Friday and Saturday nights the noise below from the nighclub Ruby Skye sounded like a riot going on. The commotion in front of the club caused traffic problems. (Shouting, screaming, etc)And by the wee hours the clean-up crew would dump a load of empty bottles in the recycle bin about every 15 minutes. (CRASH)-I'd guess about 15 times.The real shame is other than the noise I would strongly recomment this hotel.If I were them I'd call the police to make a &quot;disturbing the peace&quot; complaint.	
Apr 8 2008 	LOVE the Donatello!	We are Shell Vacation Club members and the Donatello is part of SVC's network. It was really a pleasant surprise, as I've always heard how small the rooms are in SFO. Our room/suite was incredibly spacious with the best bed ever! I also like the stereo and DVD player in the room. Location is really key. The Donatello is just a couple of blocks from Union Square and less than a mile walk to Chinatown. It was very easy to get around on buses and trolleys (bus is definitely the way to go, and you don't need to buy the $18 week pass...it's only $1.50 for the bus with a 2 hour transfer for free).My only complaint about the hotel was that the jacuzzi tub was broken (and apparently has been since November 2007...are there no repairmen in this town?), and there is no pool. But we were so busy sightseeing everyday that it didn't impact us in the least.Staff were incredibly friendly and they've got a pretty darn good happy hour everyday in the lounge. We absolutely recommend it!	
Mar 31 2008 	We loved The Donatello Club	We stayed at the Donatello during the week of St. Patricks Day,2008. The weather was sunny and of course a little chilly but we are from the NH so we thought it was great. We were very impressed with the Donatello. The staff was very friendly at all times. The food at the Restaurant on the 2nd floor was great and we very much enjoyed the delicious pastries, coffee and juice served upstairs in the Donatello Club level. Our room was clean, large, and the bed was so comfortable. The bathroom was marble tiles and the decor, reminicent of Italian style. The location was near to the shopping district at Union Sq and in a good area, not too hilly right there. They have a parking garage which we did not need, we used the public transportation,streetcars and the cable cars. Do the cable cars and ride on the outside standing up. It's fabulous!The Hertz rental car shop is right next door,very convienent!!We highly recommend The Donatello and would go back in a second!!	
Mar 30 2008 	Wonderful Hotel (Watch out for noise!)	A wonderful hotel. We stayed 2 nights. From when we arrived, the hotel staff were amazingly helpful. The only big negative of this hotel is the noise outside. We asked for a quiet room and we could still hear the crowds clubbing across the street. It wasn't enough to keep us awake, but we can imagine in a room facing the street, it would be pretty bad. Ask for a room high up and away from the street (no view, but quieter). The restaurant food was also really good and we ate there twice. The wine and cheese tasting was no big deal, but the pent house lounge was nice to sit and relax, drink some tea, etc. There was no real &quot;work space&quot; or desk in the room, though, so finding space to use the free internet might be difficult at times. Just have to work from the bed. The inclusion of a little kitchenette and all the cable movie channels for free (no pay-per-view! What a concept!), though makes up for this minor deficiency. This really is a good 4 star hotel with 5 star service. Highly recommended.	
Mar 25 2008 	Loved the Donatello	Fantastic location, staff were ever so friendly especially Jesus, it was our honeymoon and without thought we were upgraded and given a bottle of champagne. The only downside was that the rooms were a little tired but very clean, and if I'm honest you are only sleeping there as there is so much to do in San francisco.Definitely recommend staying there again - don't bother with breakfast though - a few danishes don't cut the mustard for me.	
Mar 24 2008 	Disappointing and unorganized	If I have to summarize this hotel in one word it would be: UNORGANIZED! Maybe Im a little jaded because I had such high expectations (and had read some great reveiws) and was disappointed from the very beginning. This hotel has some good qualities, but a few minor improvements here and there could make it a lot better. The bad: Dated rooms, poor communication and check in, questionable housekeepingThe good: Good location, Lounge with coffee and tea, Free Wi-fi...The parts that made me sad: Before checking, I called to see if I could get some assistance, we were celebrating our anniversary and I wanted to get some ideas and restaurant listings. Well, I called several times and they kept transferring me to someone else, then someone else, and then leave a voicemail (and I did and was never called back), but that wasnt too big of a deal. We got to the hotel (after a very long trip and flight delay) about 15 minutes AFTER check in time, (which was perfect in my mind because I really wanted to check in and relax). When we got there, they said our room wasn't ready yet because the people who had been in the room previously had requested a late check out. So they proceeded to call housekeeping to have the room cleaned. They said our room would be ready in 15 minutes (is that all it takes to clean a room?); we could have a seat in the lobby or go up to the lounge on the 15th floor and have some coffee. We elected to go up to the lounge and they said they would send someone up with the keys. Well, over half an hour later, we were still waiting, so I asked the concierge in the lounge if they could check to see if our room was ready yet. The answer was, yes, it was almost ready, but we would have to go back downstairs to get our keys because the bellboy was busy. And please keep in mind that we were dragging our luggage around this whole time. And they didnt bother to apologize or thank us for waiting. So we finally got into our room. And I am usually a very happy person. I was NOT happy to be moved around back and forth because they failed to plan wellThey let someone else stay late and made us wait because of it.I have stayed in many hotels all over SF, and I appreciate and recognize the difficulties that come with antique buildings. I expected thin walls and even though we were on the 11th floor, we were able to hear traffic outside. This was expected. However, I was kind of surprised at the large gap at the bottom of our room door, it allowed quite a bit of light through (making it hard to sleep for me), but can be covered with a towel. The room showed its age, was not cleaned very well, as there were documents from the last guests left in our room. The couch was a lumpy looking nightmare; the cushions didnt seem to fit right. They seem to be pretty cheap here. A hotel booking website lists that they have free breakfast, but the breakfast is actually $4 for 1 glass of orange juice and 2 pastries. Spend your money elsewhere; there are tons of great restaurants in SF. The housekeeping staff left me somewhat puzzled day after day. On some days, we would receive replacement toiletries, some days we wouldnt. When we got there, there was only 1 bathrobe (for 2 people), but they were nice enough to bring another one at our request. But then on another day, they took both robes and didnt replace them. They even gave us a used shampoo on one day. The maid also came in when we had the do not disturb sign up She said she thought that we had left. Those were some unusual experiences for me, but I figure they were just oversights..? On a side note regarding housekeeping, I came across a coffee spill in the lobby that wasnt cleaned for 2 days not too sure if they regularly look around and cleanAnd then 2 days after I checked out, they charged me $1 for a soda I didnt drink. When I called to ask about it, I got transferred 3 times and was told, &quot;well, its only $1&quot; but she would ask to see IF they could refund it as a courtesy. I dont even drink soda. Its not my fault if they miscounted something. I dont care about the dollar, but in the travel and hotel industry, I expect a different standard. The parts that made me happy: The concierge (both downstairs and upstairs) were friendly and seemed willing to help. Wi-fi in the room, as well as a computer in the lobby for guest use was nice. This hotel is in a pretty good location, very close to Union Square (but you are in SF; so there will be beggars anywhere you go), the lounge upstairs has some nice views. The lounge also has coffee, tea and hot chocolate all day. This was a small little perk that I really liked, especially considering the cold weather. They also have umbrellas in the room in case it rains. The rooms are a nice size for SF. The safe in the room was big enough for our laptop! New TVsThere are a lot of nice things about this hotel, but they need to tighten some of their employee and organization issues.	
Mar 16 2008 	Highly recommended- this place is awesome!	We did a lot of research on hotels before booking our vacation. I've been to San Francisco several times, but this was my husband's first visit so I wanted him to have a good experience. The Donatello was highly recommended by others on TripAdvisor and other sites, and appeared to be in the location and have the amenities we were looking for. We were EXTREMELY SATISFIED with our stay this March. The property is quiet, clean, all of the staff are friendly (front desk, bell desk, concierage, cleaning staff) and very helpful and the rooms are large (high ceilings) and well appointed. We did not expect the room to be as large as it was, and the king size bed was a welcome sight at the end of each day after a lot of walking. The turn down service was very nice and cleaning staff were super friendly. The mini fridge, micro wave, wet bar and in-room safe (which was free and very easy to use) came in handy. The free in-room wireless was very nice as was the flat screen TV and DVD and CD players.The location is awesome- easy to walk to dining, shopping, cable cars, bus stops, etc. This is a high class place! Nearby are Cafe Mason (good Italian food), coffee shops, a live blues place (Biscuits and Blues), a live jazz restaurant (Les Joulens), Walgreens, etc. Plenty of places to eat, drink, and socialize.Do not be swayed by occassional review comments that make light of the complimentary breakfast. The continental breakfast is fine. No, it's not a free buffet, but includes gourmet coffee, tea, fresh squeezed orange juice and pastries (muffins, scones, crossants, doughnuts) are served on the top floor (Club level) each day. We stayed 8 nights and I'd estimate that about half of the days also had fresh fruit tarts. We thought it was fine. The coffee and tea are available until late in the evening, which we found to be a nice touch.Though this is very minor, one annoying thing was the front desk concierge who asked us several times about attending a presentation about another Shell property (time share) in exchange for a free gift or car rental. It wasn't a big deal, but she asked when we checked in and called the next morning to ask us again. When I declined, she dropped it and did not ask again.The bell desk staff were very helpful in arranging a shuttle back to the airport for us and shipped a package and postcards for us. The concierge also recommended a number of tours for us. Instead of going with the Grayline large bus tours, we actually booked online with Incredible Advertures, which offered a small, 12 person van and pick up service from the hotel. Here is their website: http://www.incadventures.com/. We took two tours- the Yosemite tour and the Muir Woods &amp; Sonoma wine tour. John, our tour guide was excellent and we'd recommend this company to others.The Donatello's super friendly staff were much appreciated. We would DEFINITELY go back, and highly recommend you stay at the Donatello if you'd like a nice, quiet, relaxing stay.	
Feb 26 2008 	Great stay at the Donatello!	I stayed for two nights over the President's Day weekend &amp; just loved the Donatello!! I was there on a RCI exchange. The staff just couldn't have been friendlier or more helpful! The lobby concierge Shari was so great, felt like we were old pals by the time I left. Room was huge! The Club level was really nice to get a cup of tea &amp; it would've been nice to sit outside when the weather was nicer. There was a great little cafe across the street (think it was La Tezza), lots of yummy fresh food, soup was killer! The refrigerator &amp; microwave in the room, along with the kitchen amenities made it easy to skip restaurants. Tip: go to the ferry building &amp; get some wonderful cheese, sourdough, &amp; some wine &amp; have your own little feast.The Donatello has a GREAT location &amp; easy to get to transportation...BUT make sure you buy your Muni pass at the airport, then take the BART in to Montgomery Station &amp; walk straight down Post Street to the hotel, about 5 easy blocks. DON'T get off at Powell Street, especially dragging luggage, crowded, crazy people, and some folks begging. Always go straight down Post to Montgomery/Market, then you can catch the underground Muni to the Embarcadero &amp; the ferry building, or catch the F-Market, the old streetcars that will take you all along Fisherman's Wharf.--although it was an easy walk down Market to the ferry building too. There are taxis right across the street from the Donatello if you need one too, fare was about $6 to the ferry building (I was running late for my Napa tour) and fare was about $9 from the end of fisherman's wharf by the Maritime Museum (my feet just couldn't take anymore walking/standing!) Although do venture down Powell to the beginning of the cable car route, fun way to see different neighborhoods &amp; heck, you have to if you're in San Francisco!! 8-)Tip: Get a Muni pass at the airport, it will be good for the underground Muni, street cars, buses, and even the cable cars.The Underground Muni is not the same as BART, even though they share terminals, BART is the train you can take in from the airport, RT to Montgomery was $10.70My fav. travel book: Dummies Guide to San Francisco, gave me all kinds of great tips!Great tour to Napa: [-] Wonderful guide, Orion &amp; nice ferry ride back (then you can pick up the cheese &amp; sourdough at the ferry building!)	
Feb 21 2008 	Perfect Location	We booked the Donatello because our timeshare company has a portion of rooms there. The location just 2 blocks off Union Square is perfect to wander and sightsee in SF. The room was clean, spacious and well appointed. Some details could have been updated but they were minor. The small kitchenette was nice, frig/microwave/coffemaker and dishware to get us through leftovers or appetizers. The breakfast/lounge area was nice, though we didn't have anything but coffee there. Nice outdoor deck and fireplace, we were the only people using the area. Desk staff was friendly and helpful, the bar upstairs was nice. We didn't try the restaurant. The only downside was our view of the rooftops behind the Donatello. We wished we'd asked for a street view.	
Jan 22 2008 	Good	Courteous reception staff - Evita especially welcoming and helpful. Spacious room with kitchenette and good dressing area with ironing board.. Poor lighting in sleeping area. Excellent bed. Quiet. Continental breakfast a complete disapointment - little seating available and the quality of the food poor. Coffee out of a thermos flask not adequate or acceptable. Little effort to satisfy guests in this aspect. Otherwise, a lovely stay in a convenient hotel.	
Jan 16 2008 	Great stay at the Donatello	The Donatello is a great hotel right in the middle of things in San Francisco. You can walk to shopping, restaurants, etc. The hotel staff was wonderful!! From the valets, to the maids, to the Front Desk staff, we found them to be quite helpful and knowledgeable.The room was quite large and comfortable. There is a great Club Room upstairs with a large fireplace where you can sit and watch TV if you want to get out of your hotel room for a while, but we spent most of our time seeing all the sites around San Francisco. Lots to see there.	
Jan 14 2008 	Pleasantly surprised with the Donatello	Well I was celebrating my birthday on the 12th and wanted to find a cheap hotel that was nice enough for 3 females in their 20's. I read the reviews of the Donatello and seemed like it was going to be a decent hotel. Once we arrived parking is 28 dollars but its in and out and valet! Which I really enjoyed. For one night stay we packed a lot of clothes, everyone was so friendly from the moment we got in we were all joking around while checking in. The staff was amazing. The hotel is in a great area, the club Ruby Skye is literally right across the street, its right there by Union Square and Market/Westfield Shopping Centre is right there as well a quick walk. Also i've requested top floor rooms before but no hotel has actually done it and the Donatello put us on the 9th floor out of 14. Way better than any other hotel. Plus the rooms were massive! It was just a King Bed with a pullout sofabed but there was tons of room. Bottom line it was amazing! Stay here! If it is a family even though the club is right there, with the windows closed we really didnt hear people talking or any loud music, of course your occasional horn honking and such but really not to loud.	
Jan 9 2008 	Great Location but noisy!!!!!	After reading the reviews and looking at photos, I was expecting more. It was ok, but if you have a room over the street, don't expect to get much sleep unless you crank the room's forced-air fan.At 4am there was a noise which sounded like a tractor, and when we were just getting back to sleep, a delivery truck idled noisily which sounded like just under our window- and we were on the 8th floor! We could hear every word the workers said. I went to the window and found out the latch didn't close all the way so I called the front desk, but they didn't seem very interested. The next few nights we turned the fan up and it drowned out most of the noise, but then we ended up with that irritated sinus feeling from all the dry air.The breakfast they offered wasn't worth the money, and their restaurant doesn't open that early, but we ate across the street at another hotel. The rooms were larger than I expected after reading the reviews. They had a kitchenette area which came in handy. The bathrooms were another story. They looked like they hadn't been remodeled since the 80's and the shower area looked like motel 6. I got an excellent rate of 172.33 per night from Travelocity group rate, so I didn't feel like complaining.The lounge area was nice, and they had coffee, tea and muffins set out. The jacuzzi was out of order, but the small gym was ok. The staff was nice enough. We didn't have much contact with them during our stay, but the week before I had called their concierge to ask about fun stuff to do during New Years and he emailed me about 10 pages of suggestions.The location is great for shoppers. Union Square is just down the street, with Macys, H&amp;M and of course the mall and all the great shops on Post St. We walked to Chinatown, and it wasn't too far. The Cable cars are close by the mall, but the lines were very long. We did have a great trip all told, but it was because we were with a large family group and well, it was San Francisco at New Years!!!	
Jan 4 2008	Good location passive-agressive service	The location is terrific - a block from cable car, 2 blocks from Union Square. The room is well decorated, though noisy and on a small side.Upstairs concierge(s) do not say hello, used the speaker phone to talk to the returns department at Macy's (spare me!), my request for missing newspaper was answered with &quot;it'll get here&quot;. The breakfast area was tastefully decorated with smelly garbage bags the day after Christmas.	
Dec 30 2007 	Great Deal! Best Staff Ever!	I'm a DJ and have travelled all over the world doing gigs at various clubs and venues. I was spinning @ Ruby Skye right across the street, so this was a perfect location. In all my travels never have I met a more professional and fun loving staff than at The Donatello. Jesus @ the front desk was entertaining. He and the entire front desk really made me feel welcomed. The bell staff was really on it and always welcomed me back with a smile. I had requested a smoking room and was placed on the 6th floor and I have to say the maid that did my room was a delight and when I needed anything she got it to me right away. In fact she was so sweet that I felt guilty having her service the room. I keep late hours and did not get to try the breakfast that was included but instead went over to Max's right on the corner and to Dottie's a couple of blocks away, both great recommendations. Actually while checkin out I over heard others complaining about the noise from the club across the street and I thought to myself that it was partially my fault, but really who expects peace and quiet when you're in a city with great nightlife! I've read other reviews and to me this place is on the top of my list.	
Dec 19 2007 	Very nice Donatello	Me and my friends stayed at the Donatello for a week, while at a conference. I must say that we were 4 and they gave us the Presidential Suite, which is great a complete flat, with kitchen, 3 rooms (very good size), 3 bathroom and a lounge. Still for a presidential suite I was expecting more quality. The decoration was old fashion, and that is the lowest point of the room. The rest was superb!The staff was very friendly, the room very clean, the bed very confortable! The view from the windows was great.The location was very good, just next to Union Square and the cable cars. The services was great, they were very helpfull with the bags, the taxis, the bill, the room. The hotel just has a very old fashion decoration and is in need of renovations.The lowest part of the hotel is the breakfast, they say it is included in the price, but it is very poor. Really, just orange juice, coffee and some pastries. There is no milk, no cereais, no fruit no yogurts, no bread ... nothing. And the pastries are just too sweet .... one gets sick after one day. I would prefer for the breakfast not to be included, at least you would go to some nice places down the street and not be feeling like you are paying twice.	
Dec 13 2007 	Would be excellent with a decent soundproofing	Very spacious room, excellent bedding.All equipment in perfect condition, and everything very clean.My only criticism would be the very noisy traffic even at the 8th floor, I had to sleep with earplugs. In this price range I would expect double-glazed windows which would guarantee a decent soundproofing.The breakfast was OK but nothing amazing considering the price range of the hotel.	
Dec 9 2007 	Frequent Donatello Guests	We live about an hour and a half from San Francisco and we have season theater tickets. Except for the JW Marriott, the Donatello is our favorite hotel to spend the night. (They are across the street from each other.)We go to hotelres.com and look for the &quot;parking and breakfast&quot; package, which we can usually get for around $165, or less, depending upon the season and conventions in the city, etc. Since hotels in the city are charging $40 and up for parking we consider it a bargain for the convenience. Granted, the &quot;breakfast&quot; is only orange juice, coffee and rolls, but it is served in the top floor lounge with three terraces with views and free newspaper and a fireplace. This floor also has a fitness center for guests, if you have time. Besides being a hotel-type accommodation, this is also a kind of &quot;resort&quot; property with some people owning time share accommodations. I don't know how that works, but it is irrelevant, really, if you are staying there.The rooms average 425 square feet and include a sitting area, a wet bar, with coffee maker, sink, fridge and microwave, and there is electronic equipment like a DVD player, etc.Also granted, if you are in a corner room on Mason and Post, early morning noise can be a problem. We simply ask for a room away from the noise.The hotel is well run, has a good restaurant, and is located a block away from Union Square.
