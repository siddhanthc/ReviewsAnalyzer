Oct 15 2009 	Alcatraz is more appealing	I checked into this dump last Saturday with 2 friends - it was horrendous! The staff are the absolute rudest creatures I have ever come across! The Hotel is in a seedy part of town - and is quite run down and dirty. The smell in the room was appalling! - We stayed 2 hours and then checked out and went to another hotel. Alcatraz would have been cleaner than this dump and way more appealing!	
Dec 5 2008	For Budge-Conscious Only	I wanted cheap, cheap, cheap near Union Square for one night. I paid $59, and I think this was still a low-end price in a neighborhood of hostels, run-down hotels, homeless, junkies and metal security gates on every door. The area is one of the most disgusting I have ever seen in any city. What is going on in San Francisco that this can't be cleaned up?  The good news for budget-minded travelers is that the hotel androoms aren't bad, and it is within walking distance to Market Street and the fancy hotels and department stores in Union Square. The tiny room looked &quot;refreshed&quot; with decent, clean linens on a king bed, a polished granite counter on the vanity and the same granite siding in the shower. They provide a bar of soap and a small bottle of shampoo. Security seems good, with double locks on the door. I also was rewarded with a perfect view of a whale mural a la Wyland from my wndow.But my advice is - if you can afford better, go for it..	
Oct 16 2008 	Hell hole	This motel was absolutely disgusting. We arrived on a Sunday and so the parking was tight, very few spots left, most were on the right on the footpath, so anyone walking past could scratch your car. The room just gave off a bad vibe as soon as you opened the door.The carpet had obviously been cleaned recently because it was still wet when we got to our room and it smelt horrible. The bathroom was tiny, the window looked out onto an alley behind the hotel (no fence) and also no flywire to stop anyone getting in throught it. There was also a sharps container in the bathroom. The beds had horrible plastic coverings underneath the sheets, which made a loud crackling noise anytime you moved. The beds also dipped in the middle so my partner and I ended up pretty much sleeping on top of each other in the middle of the bed. We were on a very tight budget and at $80 a night, this was the cheapest motel that we could find. I have stayed in much nicer cleaner hotels for a lot ocheaper than that. Spend the extra money and get a decent place, even if yo have a tight budget. I wish we had.	
Oct 15 2008 	I'd rather sleep in a DUMPSTER!	Seriously, the guy who said he'd rather stay at a whorehouse is NOT KIDDING.I am covered in BITES! We did not get the RATE WE WERE QUOTED!There are PLASTIC SHEETS on the bed, like you'd put on a four year old's bed.The noise was UNBEARABLE!The ODOR is still on my baggage and clothing.Really, the proximity to fun things to do and the rates do NOT give JUSTICE to staying in this DUMP.I called Travelodge to complain...and they did NOTHING.I have stayed in many, many inexpensive hotels in my travels across this country and have never been so offended. If I could rate this pace lower than 'terrible' I would.	
Sep 7 2008 	Don't do it!	This place is a dump! I read that it was remodeled...well if they went for a dirty, dated look, they accomplished it! There is no A/C, and it was a warm day when I check in. Windows do not have screens and it smelled aweful. My room was a small triangle broom closet with a nasty bed, nasty furniture, burn marks everywhere, probably from the crack addicts that seem to be there. I didn't stay, I checked out and moved to another hotel. I would not reccommend anyone staying there. There is also rumors of bed bugs, but I wasn't there long enough to find out but I can tell you, I would never consider walking on the carpet! eew! You get what you pay for, but this is all thumbs down!	
Jun 25 2008	Scabies should say it all!!!!	Don't stay here unless you would like scabies! This place is horrible! I would recommend staying in a whore house instead. Seriously, can't you guys wash the sheets, so people don't get mites? The locals call the alley behind the hotel, &quot;crack alley&quot;. You can literally watch people smoke crack and shoot up from your hotel room. The smell of urine and human feces is ungodly!	
Feb 25 2008 	dissater hotel	We satyed here in nov just over night before long haul flight. The only thiing u can say is its the cheapest hotel close to the airport!!! other than that it is a dump dark dirty and smelly, low rise buildings with little lighting in side or out, go some were else!!!!! remind u of scene from physcho	
Oct 4 2007	HORRIBLE!!!!	This hotel is absolutely horrible!!! It has dirty rooms (believe me YOU WILL NOT WANT TO SLEEP HERE) but also unbelievable staff. They are not helpful and as soon as you request some help or have a question they get rude - why would they not, after all you already paid so no need to be nice anymore!! There are other hotels/hostels that have low prices and actually provide SERVICE! In addition clean rooms where you don't have to feel disgusted lying in the beds. Be smart and don't ruin your holidays by this place!!	
Jun 20 2007 	Zero rating if I could	Cigarette burns everywhere, bathroom door didn't close, and a gap in the room door let in street noise and mice. Room window was street level literally ON the sidewalk, covered with grafitti, and a view of a liquor store and massage parlor. The end of our trip was during the Bay to Breakers run, so Friday was 2x regular rate, Saturday was 4x, and Sunday was over 6x rate. Fortunately found a friend of a friend who could take us in on the last night to save us from this place. Only other note is when they take your towels at 11am, you can't get another one until laundry is done at 3pm.	
Apr 24 2005	I like the Travelodge	For the price I actually like this hotel. There are many fun and interesting spots just a short walk away. Right across the street there is a fun upscale bar called Martunni's. Like many areas in SF there are bad elements near by, but I see that as part of the charm of the city. If you prefer white picket fence neighborhoods, then maybe you should stay home.The price is right, as long as you book on Travel Lodge's web site. I would caution against booking on Orbitz due to their inflexible cancellation policies.	
Apr 21 2005	Awful Hotel	The room was very shabby and is located in a very bad district of San Francisco. We checked-out after our first night and found a much better hotel.	
Jan 23 2005	So many places to eat. So liitle time.	Glad to find a nice room from the coupon book with good, simple dirctions. SF is a big place!!! Rooms were nice, once constructions is complete, will be wonderful. The manager was a great help with computer lessons.	
Aug 19 2004	An absolute pit!	The worst, dirtiest, noisiest hotel I have ever stayed in, including hotels in Eastern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.A disgrace --- amazed that TravelLodge will allow their corporate name to be besmirched by such a dump.	
Dec 5 2003	Travelodge Downtown at Ellis and Polk St. most disgusting	There are not enough words to discribe one of the worst places I have ever stayed. How Travelodge can have a property like this in a beautiful city like San Francisco is beyond me. The rooms are rundown, dirty and smelly. You would be better off pitching a tent in Golden Gate Park. Do not for any reason stay here. Travelodge at Ellis and Polk Streets.	
Nov 28 2003	Filth Pit	This hotel has got to be the worst I have ever stayed in. Room 127. The hot water is non existant. The shower nozzle was falling out of the wall. Pubic hair in the bathroom. TV impossible to see. Cigarette burns in both bedspreads. Surrounded in an area full of prostitutes and destitutes. Do youself a favour and stay somewhere else.
