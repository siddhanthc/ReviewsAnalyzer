Oct 25 2009 	Give this great clean oasis a try - you'll be happily surprised!	My daughter and I are spending the weekend at this motel as I write. We were hesitant because of the low ratings, but due to the SF Jazz Festival, this is what we could find close by the Florence Gould Theater.We are HAPPILY surprised. I would give this sweet, clean little oasis a good solid 3! And don't forget it's right across the street from the beach, and a short walk up the hill from the Cliff House restaurant where we had a delightful dinner at sunset last night.Don't discount this one! It's a sleeper, IMHO.Peace and blessings, Rev. Kate	
Aug 10 2008 	Great inexpensive San Francisco Hotel	For the price, it was a nice experience.Hotel was in pretty good condition. Could use an iron/ironing board and a alarm clock. Did have ocean view (third floor), microwave and refigerator. The last two items came in handy as we could fix our own breakfast and save a little on meals.The bathroom's were nice and there were complimentary shampoo, soap and handcreme left each day.The staff was very friendly and helpful.There is a great restaurant next door, but I wished they had a cold drink machine for the hotel customer's for &quot;after hour's&quot;.We stayed a week and definitely would consider this a choice of hotel's because of the low price for the season and San Francisco area and the location. Very nice!	
Aug 8 2008 	Clean friendly check in but bit basic	Central San Fransisco hotels all full so we came across this. Nice location near beach and quiet. Friendly check in and room clean and good size but more basic than other hotels we had stayed in. Flexible about how long we wanted to stay. We probably wouldnt come here again but there was no particular problem and I was surprised that it was so low down on trip advisors list of &quot;hotels in San fransisco&quot;.	
Jul 31 2008 	Keep Going if you Can	There is nothing special about the GHI. It was 940 pm, freezing cold, and foggy when we checked in – in July! The other hotels in the area were booked so we had few alternatives. It should be noted that we travel via motorcycle and make no reservations to keep our trips interesting. The room was good size and basic amenities were provided. On the other hand, there is absolutely no character to the place. Its almost 100% concrete, nothing special inside or out. There was chipped paint in the room and the ceiling started to leak in the middle of the night, we think it came from our upstairs neighbor’s bath tub. The repair man said he wouldn’t be able to fix it until morning which was fine with us. On the plus side, there is a restaurant attached (open til 10pm weekdays), and a 7-11 nearby. You might be able to see the ocean from the 3rd floor but it was impossible to tell due to the dense fog.	
Apr 18 2008 	Good value not recommended for business travelers.	This hotel is in a beautiful location. Across the street from the ocean, close enough to walk on the beach and enjoy the scenery. The hotel is also a few blocks walk from the street car, and also offers a shuttle service. Very convenient.However, I stayed at the hotel for an interview at UCSF. What I found to be quite frustrating was 1) no iron &amp; ironing board....what about my suit!!?! 2) no alarm clock! Luckily, my cell has an alarm clock and I had a phone call from home as a backup 3) no shampoo! It's kind of essential to look clean and well-groomed for an interview!The price of the hotel was great, and the cleaniness of the room was just okay. If I had to do it over again, I would've stayed someplace a bit more comfortable (expensive) since it was only for one night and I had an important agenda in SF.	
Feb 29 2008 	Pretty basic but a great location	Although I did not take the free shuttle to the hospital, I stayed there because family of UCSF patients get a discount, and the location can't be beat. You can hear the ocean (the dunes are just too high to see it), and can treat yourself to a splendid walk on the beach or into Golden Gate Park. Maintenance has declined since the first time I stayed -- my room had no toilet paper holder and I think an inaccurate thermometer though the heat does work if you move the lever to &quot;emergency&quot;. And oddly, the room seemed to have no clock. The shower is primitive, but it works. The beds are not as comfortable as many. But the price is right (with the discount) and it's a great location to wake up in.I had no problem at all with the staff. And on any night other than Thursday, you could get a thai meal or a pint of beer next door until 10 p.m.	
Jul 25 2007	Basic - Accommodation	We arrived late in this area and the motel we wanted to stay at was booked out so had to find something fast. We ended up at this place which initially we thought okay but over the evening decided we did not consider it very good value and extremely basic. We had a double twin which cost $142 including tax. The room had not coffee making facility nor clock or iron and board! We have not stayed in SF before therefore don't know if this price is good/bad for this level of accommodation. Though we have moved further along the beach one block back and paying about $25 more for a much more comfortable place with coffee, clock, a hot tub! We have paid a little more because we have two bedrooms one room doubling up with tv and fridge.Our room had sea views but we did not feel very comfortable opening the curtain/door as other guests walking past could see in.	
Jul 4 2007 	It'll do...	Well, it's a good location if you're going to spend a lot of time at Ocean Beach. It's right there, and very handy. Also good if you don't plan on spending much time in the room. We were referred to this hotel by UCSF, where my husband was having surgery. It's really easy to get back &amp; forth betweeen the Parnassus campus &amp; this hotel. Pretty much a straight shot. Thank goodness I didn't spend much time in the room. It's clean, pretty much, but that's about all I can say for it. OLD furniture. And not much of it. Decoration? One of those 'wallpaper borders&quot; pasted about waist level around the room. Pretty dismal. But the bathroom is clean, and the beds are OK. It even had a microwave &amp; refrigerator. But no hair dryer, not even an ALARM CLOCK. And bring your own shampoo.	
Jan 19 2007 	Comfortable 	While my husband was in the hospital at UCSF, I stayed in this hotel for 10 days. What I appreciated most was the flexibility I was allowed for the amount of time I needed to stay. They understood that the length of a hospital stay can vary so they gave me the option to check out early or stay on longer as needed. It was one less thing to worry about!The room was very spacious, containing a queen size bed, large dresser with mirror, a table and chairs, additional drawer space in the tv stand, a refrig and microwave. The bathroom was also good size. The room was clean and the furniture was in good shape. The first room I was given was close to the stairs - I asked to move to a different room and was allowed to do so without any problems or hassle. Patients/Family of UCSF are given a rate discount and free shuttle service to/from the hospital is provided upon request. The only draw back was that the shuttle does not run on the weekends. There is a Muni Bus stop two blocks from the hotel, down a well lit street, that runs to the hospital. I drove to the hospital a few times on my own - it's easy to find from this hotel and is only a 15 minute drive.The hotel is close to the ocean and Golden Gate Park - both easily within walking distance. The hotel is in a good neighborhood. I would difinitely consider staying here again.	
Oct 28 2006 	Pleasently Suprised	I used Sidestep the reservation came through worldres.I have stayed in about 40 different hotels in San Francisco, but never anything outside of Downtown. I didn't stay downtown due to a convention at the Moscone center. I thank the convention for helping me find this hotel.The Great Highway Inn came as a nice suprise. The G.H Inn is 1 &amp; 1/2 blocks off of the &quot;N&quot; Judah tram line, and is a very easy walk, to access anything in the city. I took the walk both evenings after sunset and felt at ease due to lighting and the numbers of other people useing the same walkng areas.With exception to early evening traffic the Hotel is in a very quiet area. Quiet is something unheard of in downtown SF. Parking is free at G.H.Inn. There is a free shuttle to UCSF Medical Center. There is an on site restaurant.The room amenities are not what those demanding special treatment, or being treated like king will expect, but the are what you need. If you want snacks you will have to go to a nearby store and get them. That takes a bit of thinking ahead while riding the &quot;N&quot; line where there are many choices. Ice is available in the office.The room was clean, quiet and comfortable. I heard NO noise from adjoining rooms and had two very good nights of sleep. I am easily awakened and had no problems at the Great Highway Inn.I mentioned in my reservation that I had some health problems and would be using the shuttle and would like a ground floor room. What I got was what I asked for.Cudos to the Great Highway Inn.	
Sep 29 2006 	Bright and Clean with a view	This was a very nice Room. We only stayed one night, but we stayed in a huge room with a ocean view and a king size bed. The room was a little pricey $135 was $10 extra for ocean view, but was very clean and had a lovely bathroom. The motel was near the famous Cliff House restaurant and right across the street from Golden Gate Park and Ocean Beach and we drove 2 miles to &quot;The Haight &quot; district. Also they offer free parking which is very rare in SF. I highly recommend this hotel for couples and families who want to stay near the ocean in San Francisco. Enjoy!	
Jun 21 2006 	UCSF Surgery trip	Stayed at the Great Highway Moter Inn on April 19 to 21st,2006. our trip was for my Dads brain surgery at UCSF. We booked here because we found out that the moter inn would take you to the hospital when you needed to go. I was a little concerned about return trip back to motel because I was told by another place that they will not pick you up at hospital for return to motel ! After staying here and using the Free Shuttle that the moter inn provides I was very happy as I found out they will take you to UCSF and pick you back up at hospital for return to moter inn ! No need to pay a taxi or expensive parking even if you could find it close by. We found our experience with the people running the Inn very pleasant. Our room was clean and okey on space,with a table and chairs and a refridgerator and microwave in room. If we needed to we would stay again.	
Mar 29 2006	horrible!!!	I was not asked if I wanted smoking or non-smoking room when I checked in. When I walked in, it was full of scent of smoke. I asked for another room, and they didn't have any. When I asked for a refund, they said absolutely not. I emailed and called, I've only been ignored.	
Feb 3 2006 	Got Bedbugs? Great Highway Inn Does!	GOT BEDBUGS? Great Highway Inn does! This was by far the worst hotel room we have ever stayed in. Yes, there really were bedbugs in the bed (along with someone else's hair). I thought at first the &quot;bug&quot; was a baby roach, but took it to a local pest control office and had them identify it. Can you imagine my horror when they said &quot;bedbug&quot;?After I saw the pictures on the website, I wish I had taken photos in our room. Room 216 looked nothing like the photos on the site.The furnishing were old and dingy. The room was extremely cold when we arrived. We turned on the baseboard heater and waited for it to get warm. And we waited .....and waited. It took five hours before we could actually take our coats off. The furnishing were sparse at best. There was the requisite bed, lamps and dresser (with goo stuck to the bottom of the drawer). As a bonus, there was a small refrigerator. However, there was no ironing board, iron, coffee pot or clock. But there was free parking and the room was large. The bathroom was newer and did have a tub/shower. The water pressure was virtually nonexistent. Once we finally got warm and went to sleep, our neighbors had a lover's quarrel and were screaming from the balcony at 4 am. I realize this could happen anywhere, but it just made a bad night worse. And then we found the bedbug. What a way to start a new day!I would discopurage anyone from staying here under any circumstances-unless maybe you brought your own bug bombs, vacuum, bedding, etc.	
Oct 11 2002	Stay Away From The Great Highway Inn	There's nothing great about the &quot;'Great' Highway Inn&quot; in San Francisco. I would strongly discourage anyone from staying there. Reasons why:1. I had a room on the second floor. Great view, as it is by the ocean, however the hotel DOESN'T HAVE AN ELEVATOR. Gee, that makes a lot of sense since it has three floors. If you're staying on the third floor, hopefully you're traveling light, as there is no one to help you with your bags.2. While San Francisco usually has a rather temperate climate, I was there in October, which is the hottest month for SF. Also, the time I was there, it was unusually warm with the temperature reaching the early 90s. That still isn't too bad, but if you throw in 80% humidity, you can pretty much cut the air with a knife. Why am I mentioning this? Because the Great Highway Inn DOESN'T HAVE AIR CONDITIONING. I guess it was built in the middle ages.3. To put it nicely, the management is not the friendliest (or the most competent). My mother tried calling me and she was put on hold for 10-15 minutes, then hung up on. Then, when she called back, they supposedly rang my room. I was definitely by the phone the time she called, and it never rang (they rang the wrong room).4. It's not in the best part of town. There isn't really a lobby. To check in, you have to go to a window and have the man (who speaks really poor English) unlock the door to let you into this closet-sized lobby. Needless to say, you don't get the most welcome and secure feeling when you check in.5. It's expensive for what you get. It's over $100 a night and this is definitely overpriced for what you get for your hard-earned money.In conclusion, DO NOT stay at the &quot;Great&quot; Highway Inn. It's definitely not worth the price (even if they reduced it by half) and it's doesn't seem like the safest area. However, if you enjoy using the stairmaster &amp; sauna at your local gym, then by all means, check it out.
