Aug 21 2009 	you get what you pay for	The room was about the size of the bed, bedsheets and blanckets were filthy. Hallways were dirtry and poorly kept. The neighbourhood also is not the best in SF... you really get what you pay for.	
Jul 16 2009 	Didn't allow to occupy the Room although i had booked everything online	I had a terrible experience here and that's why i am writing even after a year of my staty in this lousy hotel. The hotel front desk guys are very unfriendly and have a hatred for a people from a specific country. Though i had booked online, i didnt carry the print out and hence i was asked to wait for more than 1 and 1/2 hour. They dont have a proper fax machine also and when i contacted priceline to send the fax again, they couldn't receive the fax message. This happened just in front of my eyes.There is no customer service at all. Ridiculous, dont stay here.	
Mar 20 2009 	Awfullterrible bed bugs never again!!!!	It can be found in not very mice neightborhood- lot of homeless people sleeping on the streets. If I close my both eyes for room itself I would say &quot;on budget, do not expect anything&quot; kind of ratind. But the bathroom (too nice name for that place) STINKS!! Bathtub from II World war, stepping in only in shoes. Then falling asleep - not chance- BED BUGS will wake you up for sure!!! The biggest problem I brought them with me to my friends place in Fresno whom I visited for wedding anniversary and eventually brought them home to Europe. I keep fighting against them still and can not get rid of. Is not there any HEALTH AUTHORITY in US that would close such a place? DO NOT GO THERE! You safe yourself a lot of trouble. I have even changed the room, but bugs were also there. So such a small thing that donut and lousy coffee is the breakfast did not matter anymore. I was just waiting to open in the morning and flee AWAY!! I would rather pay some extra for higher level .	
Aug 30 2008 	Very good value and short walk to everything	The other reviews here does in general not do this hotel justice. What do you expect when you can get a single room for $ 42 on Priceline? I enjoyed my stay here, and would easily recommend it to people who are traveling with an open mind and who have spent a night in a hostel or a low-key hotel before. I had a room with a shared bath room in the hallway (but it seemed like I was the only one using it, so there was no line or dirt in the there.) The room was decent enough, with an old television set that seemed to be from the 1970's that did not have more than a few channels with bad reception, but it was a pretty cool piece of history, and who's in San Francisco to watch TV anyway? The windows were slightly dirty and facing the street, but I didn't experience much noise. It's in the Tenderloin, which means that you can walk to the BART train or the cable car in a few minutes, and to Union Square too. There's been said a lot about the Tenderloin on Trip Advisor before, and I'm not gonna pretend that it's a particularly beautiful place, and there's a lot of homeless people on the streets, but they never even asked for change as I walked through the neighborhood many times, and they never seemed to bother anyone. In my opinion, it's an area that you can easily stay in and walk through anytime if you're a guy or in a group, although I can understand it if single females or families with kids do not wish to spend a lot of time here. I don't think much is going to happen to anyone, except perhaps being if you can spare a dime. I was also gonna say that the hotel may not be the best spot for a romantic holiday, but now I just remembered that the couple in the room next door were gettin' it on both when I checked in at night and also the next morning when I woke up (the walls are VERY thin), so I might have to reconsider that thought. If you're open minded, want to save a lot of money, and don't mind seeing the slightly shadier sides of California, this is a pretty good deal.	
Jul 18 2008 	S**t Hole	I would say my stay at this hotel was worse than terrible. I have never stayed anywhere like this hotel before. We walked in and we got the key and went up to the room and right away I called Priceline to see if they could find us another hotel. Priceline would not help us, Priceline did tell me if we got another hotel we could not get any of our money back. So dont ever book anything through Priceline either. I got it 2 ways while there. Nor did Priceline tell me we would have to pay 25 dollars a day for parking on top of what we paied for that nasty room. Nor do they tell you parking is 2 and a half blocks from the hotel. When there my daughter and I was walking back from parking our car and people was selling and not trying to hide what they were doing. And I did take pictures of the room if you dont beleave what I am telling you.	
May 24 2008 	terrible place!!!!	It is one of the worst hotel I have ever seen ! it is very dirty and it is in a very dangerous area... do not ever go there!	
Feb 2 2008 	Oh my gosh!!!!	We book a hotel 2 days before we went to San Francisco on the last minute, and we were surprised on the location. The room are small, I dropped something and rolled under the bed and I found something else, I think that room was never been dusted. we could not sleep that night, because people outside we're talking very loud. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.	
Oct 21 2007 	Fantastic Place	Had a fantasic stay here. It's not the Ritz, but it's very centrally located within easy reach of everything. The homeless people are around, but we had no problems. In fact, when slimming down my contents of my suitcase a pair of my pants flew out the hotel window, and ended up on the flag pole! So the hotel Verona had an American flag, a British flag and a pair of my pants on show! The pants then slipped to the floor and a homeless person picked them up and carted them off!It was very entertaining watching the drama unfold in the evening on the street! I would honestly recommend this place to anyone, just open your mind, and see something new, and if nothing else, you will return home grateful for what you have in life.	
Oct 16 2007 	If you like diseases the ghetto and being mugged...you'll love this place.	The room was very tiny, and very out of date. The TV only got about 4 channels and the windows were covering in bird poop. The view from the window was creepy...an alley with a fire ecsape and some wigs and clothes hanging off some wiring. Not to mention it was located in the scariest part of the city. It was so nasty, I didn't even want to shower in the bathroom or sleep in the bed. I slept on top of the blankets and didnt sit on the toliet seat in fear contracting something. AND they make you sign a contract when you check in saying that if anything is stolen, they can't be held responsible. I don't ever remember signing anything like that in the past when I've stayed at a hotel. Something positive? I attended a kick [--] Gwar concert. Something positive about the HOTEL?....I couldn't tell you. I wouldn't suggest anyone to stay there...	
Aug 24 2007 	Loved the transportation	I stayed alone at Verona for 5 days during my conference visit in Hyatt Regency, Embarcadero St. The hotel has a fantastic transportation convenience, that there is a Bart station in front of the hotel. The area there however was not very noisy. I was a bit nervous and scared at my first day there because of the amount of homeless people over there. However, during my remaining 4 days stay, i was used to it. The big tip is not to care about any of the homeless people. They would ask u for money, u can just ignore them and nothing bad would happen. By seeing this fact, I think it is quite a peaceful street to live in. In terms of service and facility of the hotel, they have a tv set and an attached bathroom in my hotel room. Nothing is particularly unpleasant. They also provide free breakfast every 7am to 9am. However, the breakfast is limited to 1 donut per person and with free flow of coffee.So, I would recommend this hotel for you, if you want a nice and cheap (around $58 per night) hotel to stay at.	
Aug 3 2007 	Verona - San Fran - YUK!!!	Booked through an agency at last minute, what a mistake. If only I had read some reviews from 'TripAdvisor' first! I was travelling from London on way to NZ.. The driver of the San Fran taxi asked me 'how did you choose this place?' And when I asked him why, he just said... don't go walking around at night!I was a tad concerned. But on arriving at 1.30am I was even more concerned at the area I was in. Thought that I would be OK as it was only 3 blocks from Union Square. How wrong I was then, too.The entrance was dark, dull and dirty.The lift was old and rickety.The corridor and room smelt of dried urine.The room itself was dirty, though sheets were clean.Stains on the floor in bathroom.Towels and shower clean, though shower curtain left a lot to be desired.Small spiders came out of the overflow hole in hand-basin.TV didn't work very well. -I was told that building is being upgradedBreakfast !! well, sweet doughnuts were in a cardboard box on the hotel lobby desk, and some hot coffee &amp; water was also availalbe down there. Outside there were many people wandering around drinking, with some sleeping on the street while others were selling items until 5am - 6am each morning. Outside the Hotel, there were people having mini-fights and yelling to each other all night - this was along all the streets nearby so it was very noisy even with bedroom window shut. In the day-time groups of men were blocking footpaths, needing me to either walk through them or go onto the road amongst traffic. Most of these people were drinking or had difficulty walking.A feeling of being unsafe was strong, but I did stay as I had pre-paid. Such a shame as it has now added to my dissatisfaction about being in the USA..... I will not come again.I will not use that internet accommodation agency again - and will send them a report, too.	
May 18 2007 	Worst Hotel Ever!	My job requires me to travel all over the country, and have stayed at many hotels (some good and some bad). I decided to go to a travel website and saw Verona for only 35$ a night but when i got there i found out why it was so cheap. There are drug addicts all around and very sketchy people. I saw one smoking a crack pipe right in front of the hotel, and i saw another getting frisked by an undercover cop. When i parked right in front by a meter, a homeless man knocked on my window and asked me if i needed any &quot;aids&quot; refering to drugs. Another lady was right in front swigging down a cheap bottle of vodka at noon. I checked in to the hotel around that time, and when i did the desk clerk wanted to charge me 35$ (the same price of the hotel) to park my car. I talked her down to 10$. I then went up the creaky elevator from 1920 saw my room with a stained comforter and tv that didnt work, and basically checked out right then. I checked in at noon and checked out a half hour later. I can honestly say you will not feel safe at this hotel and even though its cheap I wouldnt risk my safety for a few bucks. Worst Hotel Ever!	
Apr 12 2007 	Horrible in all senses	Definitely not recommended. Yes, the staff was nice, hopefully!The place is horrible, dirty (I was wondering if we were going to find bugs in the bed linen) and located in the worst street of Tenderloin. We didn't even have a shower in the morning because of the state of the barhroom. I don't know about the rest of the floors, but the 5th one was very noisy and with constant door slammings during all the night.Summary: avoid Verona, there are other places better located and around the same budget.	
Jun 26 2006	in the heart of the tenderloin.	i was a little nervous based on the prior reviews, but alas, there were no bedbugs, or bugs of anyother sort. i checked under the bed, under the blanket, under the sheets, in the closet. the hotel itself isn't half bad. the rooms are small, it's noisy and the hotel staff aren't overly friendly, but i have a feeling that has something to do with the location (which i'll get into later).the rooms have a full size tub in a tiny bathroom. the sink is located directly across from the beds (not in the bathroom). the elevator is super old school, it smells like an old attic, but that's vintage, baby!*dun dun duuuuuuuuun*:the view:if you don't know what the tenderloin district is, then go here:http://www.answers.com/topic/tenderloin-san-francisco-california.if you think your brave enough and have a sense of humor, then this is the place for you. it's a little scary at first, but when alls said and done, it's not that bad. in fact, it can be a little entertaining, it's fun to look out of your window and see all the activities on the street. there are tons of bums around, drinking beer, illin, yelling, singing, doing deals. we saw 2 men and a woman smoking crack from our window. out in the open. apparently the cops are afraid to work in the 'loin. they hang out in corners and across the street from the verona. i don't think they bother people much. i didn't even see them asking people for money. the hotel staff said not to leave anything in the car, because they'll take it. we saw a couple bums with mini-garage-sales, selling miscellaneous articles of clothing, and other random stuff. don't know where they got it. all in all it's sad, but hey this is the reality of life.	
May 30 2006	A nice hotel. I will stay again	I stay at the verona hote on april 2006. they have renovated put new carpets, beds and have painted the rooms. I think that this hotel is in a good condition no matter what other people say. I can say that front desk clerk is friendly and can help you with everything you need. the neighborgood is not that bad. I can say that it is a good hotel. I will saty again no matter what other people say.just because other people say is bad I thought that is better to see it for my self than believing other people.	
Jan 11 2006	disguisting and full of bugs and rats	when i first arrived to the hotel i was greeted by a friendly staff. when i requested my room reservation he said he had to reservation for me but he said he will give me a deal and only charge me $80 a night. i luckly had my confirmation code and i got the price for $40. on my way to the room, i saw a large rat running along side the hallway. when i got to my room my toilet was licking and my sing was clogged. i was too tired to complain so i decided to go to sleep and deal with it tomorrow. when i was in bed. i felt something bitting me and threw off the covers to see atleast a dozen bugs on me. i killed then all. when i bend down to clean them i looked under the bed and say hundreds of bugs and cocroaches. i disgusted and complained and got a new room. the next day i checked out and went to the madarin hotel which in really nice.	
Nov 26 2005 	Bed Bug Problem	I needed to stay in SF for one night, so I booked the cheapest hotel I could find on the internet, which cost less than $40 including tax. Due to some flight problem, I arrived around midnight. On the way to the hotel, I walked for less than 10 min from Powell St BART station, passing quite a few homeless people. But I expected this based on the tripadvisor reviews. And those people really didn't bother me. I checked in a room on 5th floor, a small room with a leaking toilet. I had to shut the bathroom door so that I wouldn't hear the sound of water. After lying on bed for an hour, I couldn't sleep and felt itchy on my face, neck and arms. After turning on the light, I found out dozens of big and small bugs crawling on the pillows. After killing some of them, I could see my blood from their dead bodies. I talked to a friendly staff in front desk and changed a room on 4th floor. This time, I was lucky to sleep through the night without any bugs in sight. The bed sheet and carpet were OK. The next morning, I found this room had a clogged sink. I have to say I got what I paid for and I learned my lesson. I stayed in Chancellor Hotel near Union Square two years ago with a pleasant experience. I wish I stayed in Chancellor this time.	
Nov 14 2005	Great hotel if you are on a budget	This is a great hotel if you are on a budget. I got a terrific deal on a travel web site. 4 nights for $134 on my charge card bill, including all taxes and charges (I didn't use the phone anyway). Don't think you can find a better deal ($33.50 a night) anywhere in sf. True, it is not in a good area (tenderloin district), but I think if you practice awareness and watch your surroundings at all times you are relatively safe staying there. I wouldn't stay at this hotel with my girlfriend or wife and family if I had one, you should spend a little more to stay at a better hotel in a nicer neighborhood, but as a single guy on a budget this is a good bare bones place to stay. There is a police station right around the corner so there were police walking the area at night after midnight. I didn't expect much, didn't care about pastries for breakfast (but what do you expect when you pay $33 a day?) and went out to the corner diner for breakfast. There is a chinese restaurant on the corner next door and other places to eat in the area. close to the #19 bus that takes you to ghiradelli square and is about 3 blocks from the bart station. It is about 6 blocks from union square so not very far from the action. while I was there, there were groups of females and males staying in the hotel for halloween and they were coming and going at all hours of the night so I felt comfortable there. Even when they left after halloween, the hotel was a little empty but I didn't feel threatened at all in the hotel. Hotel management locks the door after 11 at night so you have to show your room key if they don't recognize you. You can call the hotel to warn them of you coming at night so they will let you in quickly if you are afraid of being mugged. yes, there were bunches of &quot;suspect&quot; people hanging around the neighborhood at all hours of the day and night, but I didn't see any drug dealing and wasn't bothered by any of these people and I ignored any of them that tried to get money from me. Most of the time I would cross the street or walk on the street to avoid any encounters and wasn't bothered by any of them. BTW, this hotel and the aida hotel on market street are owned and run by the same people. So if you just need a decent place to stay at a great price, the verona is all right. But if you want to stay at a nicer place in a safer neighborhood, you will be paying more than double the price. Just my 2 cents, hope it helps others who are looking for a cheap place to stay. Just remember that you get what you pay for and you won't be disappointed.	
Nov 1 2005	Not worth it	a) situated in a really dodgy area full of drug addicts, it's really not appealing to tourists because it doesnt convey a safe environment image. b) the staff are really not helpful and ... a bit dodgy themselvesc) the rooms arent great (TV not working, smelly through-out the hotel)d) the supposedly &quot;included breakfast&quot; consisted in a hot water container in the lobby with 5 random tea bags, no cups and a small box of doughnuts or pastry bought by someone from the hotel presumably, with flies flying around the box..so not what you'd call breakfast really.  So all in all I wouldnt recommend it at all, as there are plenty of other nice places to choose from in San Francisco. Positive point though: relatively close (i.e. scary walking distance) from BART public transport and Union square (roughly 15 minutes).	
Aug 9 2005	Cheap in all senses.	We stayed 3 nights in Verona and did not really enjoy it. In fact, the only good thing about it, is the price: $ 102/night for 5 persons (2 rooms), breakfast incl. The rooms weren't very clean (the sheets were, luckily). Bathroom on the corridor: there was some pigeon (feces) on the lavabo, which hasn't been wiped away for 3 days. Do they ever clean the place? Breakfast consists out of some sweet donuts and muffins - &quot;served&quot; in a cardboard box with a few napkins - with bad coffee out of paper cups.But the worst thing is the street were it is located: Leavenworth, on the border of the dismal &quot;Tenderloin&quot; neighbourhood. We saw junks, dealers and homeless people whenever we left the hotel and were always a bit frightened to get back at night. Nothing ever happened, though. I have to admit, once you are a few blocks further, you are right in the heart of downtown San Francisco, near Union Square. So, if you don't mind dirt and an unfriendly looking neighbourhood and you don't want to spend a lot of money, this is the place to be. Otherwise: keep away!	
May 21 2009 	Il peggior hotel della mia vita!!!
