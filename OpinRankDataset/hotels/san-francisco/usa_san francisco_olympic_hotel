Aug 17 2007	Great Hotel wonderful staff.	For the rate you are paying for this hotel, it is indeed an excellent value. The rooms are fairly clean and the hotel in general is not as bad as some other reviewers have described it to be. If you are travelling on a budget then this hotel is a wonderful value. Also, the staff is very polite and courteous, and was very helpful.	
Aug 14 2007 	EXCELLENT EXPERIENCE!	We booked this hotel last minute due to an unpleasant experience at another hotel. I can say that compared to other places this hotel is a great bargain. The olympic is clean and the rooms are actually pretty big. The staff was friendly and helpful. In short the hotel was an overall great experience for me and the wife. It prevented what could have been a disaster in san francisco. THANKS!	
Jul 2 2007	Run-Down But Cheap	I got the Hotels.com rate of $50/night, and the hotel was not worth a penny more. The electrical outlet shorted when i plugged in a phone charger. The wireless internet did not work (and had not been for a few weeks), but several hotels within a few blocks had free wireless internet (I think the Monte Cristo was one of them?). The hotel was right in the middle of everything, so the location was fantastic.The room was really really tiny; the bed was not comfortable but was satisfactory; the elevator was small and smelled like stale urine and had all kinds of weird stains and spots in it. The morning &quot;continental breakfast&quot; was anemic and there wasn't much food at all. The community bathroom was clean and worked just fine, and the shower worked fine (hot water was hot, cold water was cold). The towels in the room were clean, the sink in the room worked ok (hot and cold), and the bed sheets were clean.Overall the hotel was not outstanding, but exactly what one would expect for $50/night in an historic building in the middle of downtown San Francisco.	
Jun 8 2007	-Disgusting-	ewwwww never ever stay at this hotel its not worth a single penny =/ the room is to small,the bathroom is outside the room and its disgusting i can smell poop everywhere...	
Dec 17 2006 	Great bargrain	I stayed at this hotel because of it's location and cheap price. It's close to everything I wanted to visit and do while in the city. The rooms were small, no cable tv but then again, I only wanted to get a room to sleep in that was clean and comfortable. If you're looking for something fancy with a lot of extras, this is definitely not for you. But if you're looking for a great bargain, you can't beat this especially for it's location and with the added continental breakfast your buck goes much longer.	
Dec 10 2006	THEY CHARGE YOUR CREDIT CARD WITHOUT YOUR AUTORIZATION!!!!!	Be very careful about this hotel: I booked a room, but I had to cancel my trip to USA. So, I followed the instructions given at the site: I sent e-mails (two weeks in advance) to cancel my booking. BUT THEY SIMPLY CHARGED MY CREDIT CARD!!!!!!!!!! Now they are ignoring my e-mails and refusing to give any excuse about the mistake made by them.	
Oct 15 2006 	Beware of misleading website!	We booked in for three nights, based on the information on their wesbsite - DON'T. The website is incredibly misleading. The rooms featured bear no resemblance to those in reality. The elavator smelled like garbage (we reliased why upon leaving when we were actually sharing it with a garbage bag). We were kept awake the entire night by the other guests using the communal bathrooms, slamming doors and shouting down the corridors. And when they weren't keeping us awake the antics of the couple in the room above did. The beds should be replaced if they are that noisy! I have stayed in better youth hostels. The breakfast was awful! The coffee machine was not working, only dishing out tea coloured water. The rest of breakfast consisted of stale bread and bagels. The website should be shut down for complete misinformation. Thankfully, we left after the first night and were refunded in full for what we had paid for in advance. There are certainly better places to stay for your money in SF.	
Jul 13 2006 	What do you expect for $82????	Come on folks, get real! I know San Francisco, so I wasn't afraid of this neighborhood. At $82 a night with a private bath, this is a good deal. Two blocks off of Union Square, near Powell Street Bart and Muni. Surrounded by the Parc 55, 1/2 block from the Hilton, clean, comfortable rooms, in room phones, good continental breakfast, great food nearby. As my mom would say, &quot;Kwitchurbellyachin!&quot; Save your money to spend on shopping or tourist attractions.	
May 19 2006	in the heart of San Francisco	We spent 2 nights there, the room was cheap and quite clean but the bed unconfortable, a little but loud at night time but...remember that this hotel is in downtown and dowtown is always loud, day and night. This hotel was ok, I would come back there if I get a chance.	
May 17 2006	Cheap convenient but not cheerful	Ok this was cheaper, it was in a superb location but it was horrible. The rooms were dirty, the bed was extremely small &amp; uncomfortable. We stayed two nights leaving early in the morning only returning late at night when we were so exhausted that we could fall asleep without having to look around us for too long. The breakfast was a joke and is really worth avoiding (milk was out of date beware).The staff were extremely friendly &amp; as helpful as they could be working in such unhygienic surroundings.	
May 15 2006	loved it	The Olympic hotel is an old charming place right in the heart of downtown. If you are looking for great value, a place that is easily accessible and within walking distance this is the place you want to stay in.	
May 14 2006	Affordable and close to everything	The Olympic hotel is a small quaint hotel right in the heart of San Francisco. This is the perfect tourist spot, clean affordable, friendly and safe. It was two minutes to everything I wanted to see and all public transport is less than a block away. There is always plenty of activity, close to the night life, the clubs, pubs and shopping. Great price too..!	
Apr 6 2006	Not Like The Pictures	Cheap or not, this hotel is not what a traveller needs for a good rest. Be wary, the pictures on their website are quite misleading. The bathtub had enough dirt in it to plant a tree. We booked the room based on the photos on their website and in their brochures, and were very disappointed in what we were given. When we asked for a refund, we were refused. We did not stay there, but ended up paying for a night there. It was frustrating.	
Nov 17 2005	Clean place	Cheap and clean place, steps away from everything you need. Subway, bus, F-metro, rent a car agencies. Also it is close to Union square, china-town and financial district. Although rooms defentely need some renovation.	
Aug 8 2005	Do not stay at this hotel	I am very disappointed with my stay in this hotel. Firstly the staff are extremely unhelpful, rude and impolite...certainly not what one would have expected after reading their website. Secondly our phone and remote control are broken in our room and despite reporting this on numerous occasions nothing has been done to rectify our problem... not even an apology. Other guests too have reported this but alas to no avail. Breakfast is a slice of soggy toast with a cup of coffee.. (if the machine is filled with water!!!!) No fruit, pastries or fresh food of any description. The noise pollution is horrendous...forget any chance of a good night's sleep. Pungent odour permeates throughout the entire building... In short DO NOT STAY HERE!!! Misleading website should be shut down.	
Aug 4 2005 	Horrible	No curtains. Lumpy twin bad. Musty smell. Dirty carpet. Rooms the size of a small walk in closet. Windows that open into hallways in some rooms. Shared bathrooms are with the whole floor not between another room. Staff was not helpful. My room looked nothing like the one shown online. I would not let my dog stay here.	
May 31 2005	Olympic Hotel - Photos - why waste film	Well we booked the Olympic hotel because the web sight and photos were great and very appealling as well as the history of it.We arrived in September in the middle of a heat wave, got a taxi to the hotel very excited and couldn't wait to have a shower and clean up after travelling approx. 24 hours. Well, were will I start - got to the hotel all excited walked in looked ok, checked in, went up to our room, opened door, walked in and just stood there. The room was very small, bathroom too. We had booked in for 5 nights, what a joke. I said to my husband maybe e one night but not 5. If we wanted to go to our ports we would have to try and store them somewhere-don't know where and every time we wanted something out of it we would of had to put it on the bed everytime. The windows would not lock, no airconditioning, although there was 3 air conditioning vents outside the window, oh which belonged to another building and heat coming of them was incredible. I was so upset, being our 21st wedding aniversary. We went down stairs and told the staff did they have another room, but they said they were all the same, there was one a little bit bigger so we went up and had a look at that- not much better. Again the windows wouldn't lock. Again I said to my husband that know way I could stay here, very disappointing. We checked out. Clean and tidy, but that was about it. If your going to stay one night with just an over night bag, well maybe this would be fine. Oh and if you're feeling brave, because the windows wouldn't or didn't lock. Oh, make sure you pack extra socks to walk on the floors/carpet, just felt a bit grubby.I can honestly say and without any hesitation that I can reccommend the Raddison on the wharf.Very disappointed Aussie.	
Mar 22 2005	Nightmare	We stayed there for 2 nights. It was horrible! Dirty, everything is falling apart, no fresh towl, no hot water, TV barely working, and the front dest guy acting like we were his servants.	
Mar 19 2005	Nasty Disgusting Yuck etc.	This is by far the worst hotel I have ever stayed at. We booked through hotels and that was a problem: when we got there they had just picked up the fax from hotels, and they had just crossed off the names of the people that had paid reservations whom they would not be able to accomodate that night, including us. After much complaining, they managed to &quot;find&quot; two rooms for us. During our stay, we witnessed, literally, 4 other groups of people in the exact same situation...and guess what...one couple that came in to ask if there were vacancies was told that the rate would be cheaper if they walked over to an internet cafe and booked through Hotels....Oh my gosh! They must have some kind of deal going with hotels, and that really sickens me. My husband and I had booked a room with a private bath, and my sister, her 5 yo son, and her 16 yo exchange student stayed in a room with a community bathroom down the hallway. The shared bathroom sounded so disgusting that I wasn't even willing to go look at it. The toilet was not even working! So, the entire two days we were there, all 5 of us shared our bathroom, and that was fine, because I was worried about my family using that disgusting bathroom. We also experienced the loud sounds and breaking glass right outside our window in the alley down below. Believe me, you can find much, much better rooms, near union square, for not much more $$, and you will not be risking your health.	
Feb 15 2005	cheap hotel with a friendly staff	I stayed in this hotel for 2 nights. The hotel is old and that's what I liked about it: it has its own character. The towels could be newer but otherwise everything was clean. The staff was nice and friendlier than in the fancier hotels. I'd stay there again, especially because of it's great location.	
Feb 9 2005	horrible dirty hotel!!	this hotel was absolutely horrible. there were stains on the sheets and towels and the whole room was dirty. the whole room was on a slant and the tv barely worked. the doors have three locks b/c it's not in the greatest neighborhood. the elevator feels as if it's going to fall apart. i don't know how anyone could have given this room a good review. yes, it's cheap so i didn't expect it to be like the hilton but i expected it to be clean at the least. the rooms they have available look nothing like the room featured in the brochure. traveler beware!! 	
Nov 21 2004	A basic hotel in a good location	If you are looking for a cheap place to stay, then the Olympic hotel is great! The hotel is in a central location and not once did I feel threatened. The room itself was small and very dated, but it was clean and we had hot water every morning. We had a private bathroom and this was worth the extra money as the shared bathrooms looked horrible. The staff were also very friendly. The only problem was the lack of plugs! I am certain that the plug sockets have never been changed and they looked very unsafe so I ended up having to dry my hair in the hallway which was a pain. If I returned to San Francisco, I don't think I would stay at the Olympic, but this is only because I would prefer to stay in the Fisherman's Wharf area- the restaurants and the views of the Golden Gate Bridge there are fantastic.	
Nov 2 2004	lucky it got better	We booked a three night stay at the Olympic through Expedia and specifically paid more for the private bathroom. When we arrived they had not idea what was going on. They had put us into a shared bathroom room and we had to fight to get a private bathroom. The room was very small, smelt funny but was adequate (we thought). When we checked in we asked foe a wake up call. The next morning we woke up late and didn't get a wake up call, subsequently realizing there was no phone in the room. When we tried to shower the water would not come up to the showerhead, it would only come out of the bath. After a lot of complaining we got a new room and all was well from then. The breakfast is not worth staying around for and there is rarely more than one person working at the hotel. Apart from its location, which is excellent, this hotel has nothing else to offer.	
Sep 17 2004	Great place	The Olympic hotel in San Fransisco was a great place to stay with affordable rates. The rooms were nice and clean with the maid coming in on a daily basis. The hotel was located in a good area and close to everything. Very pleased, would recommend it.	
Jun 5 2004 	Okay...Not great but not bad either.	I just got back from this hotel today after attending a conference. It was the cheapest place out there. It is by no means fancy and it is a real old hotel. I stayed in a room with a private bathroom on the third floor overlooking the street (room 316). The bathroom is real small but clean. The hot water came on instantly. The sheets were clean. The only thing that was dirty was the carpet which could use replacing. There was no cable TV but it had rabbit ears. There is an old water radiator style heater in the room but no air conditioning. The street outside tended to be noisy by no fault of the hotel (sirens and some transient yelling). The staff was friendly.	
Apr 15 2004	Great location value staff etc.	This hotel is located in the heart of Union Square. We were within 2 blocks of the cable car start, SF Center shopping and our convention at Moscone Center. This is not the Ritz but it's not priced that way either. The hotel has a lot of character and charm and the staff were great in helping us out. The rooms were clean, decent size, but nothing glamorous. For the rate we got, we were pretty amazed. Thanks	
Mar 9 2004	Great Value - Clean 	I enjoyed a clean, quiet, pleasant room near Union Square. two Minute walk from Powell Street Bart Station and Cable Car stop.Very helpful &amp; courteous reception clerk. Overall a very good value	
Feb 9 2004	Good last minute deal	Was looking for a good deal on short notice during a busy SF weekend in June. Area is near the Tenderloin, but as in anywhere you stay, Be Aware Of Your Surroundings when out and about.  Room was nice and clean, small with 2 twin beds, but comfy. Besides, it was just for sleeping after spending the day out and about. Shared Bathroom was clean, except for a couple towels other guests left behind. Clean Up After Yourselves in Shared Bathrooms, Thank You.  They had a very nice Complimentary Continental Breakfast that filled us up.  We'd stay there again anytime.	
Jan 11 2004	Scary	For a rate so cheap, I knew the hotel couldn't be great, but wow, it was horrible. There were bugs in the room, I don't think the 'community' toilets/shower had been cleaned in a month, and the bed feels like a sheet of plywood. The hotel is located very conveniently, but there are bums everywhere and it's just scary after dark. The windows don't have screens, so when they crank the heat up to 80 at night, you open the window to an alley filled with bums breaking bottles, arguing, etc.	
Dec 24 2003	Great location and a real deal	This place is a real deal. I don't get the other reviews talking about a bad location. The hotel is literally surrounded by the Parc 55, accross the street from the Hilton, the Nikko and the Bijou. Are those hotels in a bad location too? This wasn't the Ritz but if you want a clean room in a great spot this works great. We'll be referring this to our friends who like to travel on a budget.	
Jun 6 2003	A Gut within a gut!!!!	The Olympic Hotel was one of the nastiest hotels I have ever stayed. From the owner or manager screaming at her employees to the mold on the pastries and the coffee stains in the breakfast room. I had spoken to the front desk person Alvis or something like that and told him that their were bed bugs in my room. I was told that the rate I was given was very special. I thought to myself I am sure the health department would live to here this. The neighborhood is dangerous and the bums lay out in front of the hotel. When I was their the staff was trying to chase some homeless person through the hotel with a muffin in his mouth. I was pretty scared and the homeless person is telling the people who was chasing him that he was going to stab someone. That's when I went to my room and check out. I suggest the same thing when you come to San Francisco DO NOT CHECK OUT A HOTEL CALLED THE OLYMPIC. In conclusion with the street noise and the homeless activites that happen every night. You are putting yourself in danger.	
Apr 24 2003	forget this one	Well...cheap for the area, which is Union Square. You are, however, right on the edge of the tenderloin, which is the most dangerous and filthy area of San Francisco. As far as the Hotel itself, it is not particually clean. It offers rooms with both private and shared baths, and I would not recommend the shared baths.. A few VERY large roaches were spotted in these bathrooms. It ain&quot;t the Ritz, but if you only want a place to sleep, what the hell. They do have free coffee and pastrys in the morning .If you DO decide to stay here , ask for a room with a view. That way you will get a good eyefull of the freakshow right outside the frontdoor.
