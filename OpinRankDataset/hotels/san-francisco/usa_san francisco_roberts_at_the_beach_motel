Oct 1 2009 	Been staying at the Roberts for 30 years	I've come up from LA to work at the Zoo now and then for the last 30 years. Hate to tell the people that don't like the place but it has been remodeled. But that was about 25 years ago and then again about 10 years ago. There was less rooms and more apartment like rooms instead of what they have today. It's the best price at the beach in all of SF. About half as much as it's closest competitor. No it's not a 5 star but it's a good place. The folks running it are nice. Always quiet during the week for us working guys that stay there. If your looking for a Hilton Resort stay at a Hilton Resort. This is a place with a bed and a shower. Good for road warriors. We bring our own pillows, soap and towels anyway. All that's missing is a big flashing neon sign and the place would be perfect. It's mine and my crews home away from home when we're in SF. Plus we do bring our wife's and girl friends here too. So far no divorces or breakups over it.	
Aug 24 2009 	Done the job	Motel was fine although some problems with the toilet but we got moved to another room! I would recommend it if you're on a budget travelling with friends as it is close to the beach and beside the tram to city centre!As i said it done the job and i liked the seaside theme going on in the rooms!Ask for Uncle John.....he'll make you at home in San Fran!	
Sep 25 2008 	the rudest experience I have ever had	I have stayed here once before and it was ok. The place is very old and run down. I use the chain lock and put suitcases in front of the door to feel safe. I stayed here this second time because &quot; The Great Highway Inn&quot; was booked. In addition this is where my grandparents use to stay when my grandpa had to go to the VA hospital. I believe it is not the same ownership though.I didn't sleep very well because I had forgotten my own pillows and their pillows are completely flat. When I awoke the following morning I got up and went to Ocean Beach, which was my whole purpose for being in the city. I lost myself in the walk as the ocean is captivating. As I arrived back to the motel on foot I was looking in the windows for check out time and so nothing posted anywhere. I looked in the room and on my receipt which was just my credit card receipt. There was nothing saying when check out is, nor was I told when checking in. I figured with most places it is between 11 and 12. It was 10:45 so I decided to jump in the shower. I thought I heard the phone ring while in the shower but was not sure. Once out of the shower did the usual girl thing and blow dried my hair. Once done I heard this knocking on the door and someone saying something about check out but could not quite understand. I called back that I wasn't ready yet. Within 10 mins there was another knock on the door by the lady manager, I presume. She begins yelling at me to &quot;open this door right now&quot;. I said, &quot;do you mind if I put my shirt on first.&quot; I open the door and she rudely says, &quot;it is past check out. Next time answer the phone. Check out was at 11 now get out. It is 11:45.&quot; I was shocked. I said, &quot;do you mind if I get my things first.&quot; She just looked at the cleaning person and said, &quot;she is done.&quot; I loaded my things, turned in the key, and got into my car. The clock in my car said 11:30. I will never use this motel in my life again. If I have to I will use Days Inn a block up.	
Feb 26 2008 	It's a beach Motel Get over it!!!!	Well, maybe I am just not &quot;picky&quot;. This hotel looks really run down on the outside. I was pretty skeptical the first time we stayed there. The rooms are definately not &quot;fancy&quot; but have everything you need. We have stayed here with our family at least 5 times. We go once or twice a year. So there may be a few grains of sand in the carpet...what do you expect. It's two blocks from the beach. The zoo is across the street, and a great cafe next door. What I love about it. We don't have to drive, once you are there, everything we do is walking distance. My son is 6 and loves it there! We don't have to worry about him ruining the place because it is just a good old, down to earth, crashing place. Has cable and coffee, bed, and a shower. That's all ya need. The best rooms are upstairs in the middle. Can even get a glimpse of the ocean in betwenn buildings. I am glad the snobs can go stay in a fancy place and get ripped off, but I love Roberts and will be going back again and again. The owners are nice too, they let us keep our car there extra long, so we don't have to pay for zoo parking.	
Oct 8 2007 	Could use alot of improvement	Many years ago I used to stay here on fairly regular basis. Some things never change...like a great location. Otherwise, since the place was taken over by a new owner, who doesn't seem the least bit interested in puting any money into the place it has deteriorated noticably. I just completed by most recent stay today. First when you check in the smell of curry from the resident manager/owners kitchen is overwhelming. The room is self was OK, but simply that. It was in many respects kinda rundown and shabby. The exterior is awfull and has not been painted in at least 20 years. The walls are paper thin and you can hear ever detail of what is being said, or &quot;done&quot; the the rooms next to you.Now I read one of the reviews hear that talked about hookers hanging around the place. Well Roberts is kinda dumby I've never seen a hooker around this hotel and this area and I know it very well.If possible you money could be better spent elsewhere. If you can't find anything else, as was the case with me, you can stay here for a night in acceptable comfort.	
Aug 4 2007	Hooker infested dirty nasty place	I stayed in this place during the week of the forth of July. It is awful. Very dirty rooms floors have not been cleaned in what looks to be years. They are nice people who run the place, they even allow the patrons from the zoo to park in the lot on &quot;free zoo day&quot; they charge them $5.00 to park while they are at the zoo. The only problem with that is that if you are renting a room you have to wait for a place to park. On the night of the 4th. I listened to a hooker yell the same line over and over to different clients all night. During one of her sessions her pimp even busted thru the door to let the guy know that &quot;he did not pay for that&quot;. I assume he was in his van in front of the Motel monitoring with a baby monitor. It was a long sleepless night. This would be a great spot for vice squad to work the area.	
Nov 9 2006	great find	if you live in the city its great! its close to the beach and other attractions. only bad thing is if you stay by the street gets really loud in the mornings with the street car going by. but i really loved the bath rooms. so what if they weren't all that great but if and your hunny are looking for some thing just for a night of romance and don't really care where then i would sugest this place just for the fun bathrooms. all the bath rooms in the shower have a seat where you know lots of fun can happen. but there is no tub. so if you wanted that this is not the place for you.	
Sep 25 2006 	A Different Kind of Stay	This is not a motel for the weak of heart. It is, in all senses, that sort of Raymond Chandler-esque &quot;sleazy dive&quot; that is only missing the gangsters and hard-boiled detectives. But it is a place to stay, reasonably priced, and no more outrageous than some that are far worse. My stay was shortly after the current owners took over, and they did their best, but it was clear that being hoteliers was not in their blood, and that their &quot;vision&quot; of running this place was flawed. I had stayed previously (2001-2002) when the previous owners, who had a clue, still ran it.Nonetheless, the night I arrived was the worst storm to hit the SF Peninsula in a long time, with Beach Avenue closed, and police clearing people off the beach for safety sake. Winds and rain, lightning and thunder, all crashing with the waves not 500 feet from my door and window.It was the most spectacular stay in a motel I have ever had. Second floor, watching California weather at its most magnificent, from a vantage point that I would have never thought possible.It is rundown, a bit dingy, and perhaps not a five-star luxury palace for those who wish to be pampered.But for those who want to experience a classic 1930s motel, in the middle of the Sunset District, with a western view that is to die for, there is little better than this.And for the full effect? Pick up a Raymond Chandler novel to read before bedtime instead of watching the tube, or book a room when you know a storm is coming. I'm going to be in SF in the next few months, and have no qualms about booking another room there.	
Aug 7 2006	Horrendous Motel	You would do much better to sleep out on the sidewalk in front of this place than to pay money and check into one of their rooms. Forget the money part of it for a second...the sidewalk would be cleaner...no less noisy...and actually less depressing. The rooms are dingy and moldy and dank. The beds are squalid...hair and dried fluids all through the bed and on surfaces and the carpet is foul, greasy, stinky and exudes particles into the air when disturbed by somethng as basic as walking upon it. These things however, pale when laid up against what ensued on my stay there. My girlfriend and i checked in for a week and after accomodating the dismal condition of the room...settled in unfortunately. On waking up the third morning we were both covered with what we thought were mosquito bites. Through that day...these bites kept increasing and encroaching in intensity and by the fourth morning...we were both in great duress and shock from these bites which had turned into aggravated welts. I checked the bedding more closely and found little points of fresh blood stains on the sheets and a little dead bug of a type which i hadn't seen before. The welts were running across my body in long staright rows that were deep and red and i was trying to control a feeling of panic. My girlfriend's face was covered with them. She ended up with around 200 bites and i had about 150. Upon doing some investigating...i found that this was a bed bug infestation. As someone who's made a living on the road for 35 years...this was the worst thing I've ever encountered in a sleeping establishment. We checked out on that fourth morning and i required medical treatment and steroids to overcome the danger of these bites. The physical scars are still with both of us six months later. If i had a choice between sleeping on a park bench or sleeping at Roberts By The Beach Motel in San Francisco...i'd take the bench with no second thoughts. Horrible experience indeed.	
Mar 29 2006	What a view	This motel is not for the 5 star set but if you want a relatively reasonably priced place to stay where you can look out of your window and see the Pacific Ocean then this is place fits the bill.	
Jan 1 2006	Bad Hotel!	Bad!Bad! Bad! I think that a rating of &quot;terrible&quot; is too good for this hotel. I couldnt get a single minute of sleep because of the foul smell of mildew inside my room. I couldnt go outside either seeing that it was pouring rain. On top of that, the bed sheets were torn and stained, and I found already opened condoms underneath the bed. Upon entering the room, a rat came running out from under the bed into one of the holes in the wall. At around 3:30 in the morning the few people in the hotel that could actually sleep were awakened when a group of about 5 or 6 teenage kids came into the parking lot and tried to break into one of the vending machines with a baseball bat. I was almost scared to death in the morning when I went to fill up the ice chest and I found a homeless man asleep next to the ice machine. A vacant lot next to the back parking lot literally looks like a dump, with a fence all around and all kinds of garbage from tires to dead pigeons to used needles.  I PAID FOR A CLEAN, SAFE PLACE TO SLEEP, NOT A FILTHY, DIRTY HAUNTED HOUSE!!!	
Sep 21 2005	WORST motel experience of my life!	Do NOT let the ocean nearby, sway you into this dump. I booked in advance, was later told my 'room' wouldn't be ready til evening, dispite my request and telling them my time of necessary arrival. Place was awful. Damaged carpet, holes in sheets, staff disregarded my reminding them I'd requested mid day arrival, to fit my schedule. DO NOT take any room before seeeing it first, ever. Shower water pressure was unstable, and weak. I had trouble keeping the temperature in balance, it would fluctuate from hot to cold to tepid, and it was scary and felt dangerous. Sheets had holes in them, one blanket on bed was ratty and old. Place looked like some slummy dump, but I had no time to request money back, or leave, as I had an engagement I couldn't be late for. Otherwise I would have done this immediately.I was miserable. There were other guests that disturbed me, and upset me greatly. I did not sleep at all, and was ill in the morning from such a bad experience and felt sick and left there sick. My schedule was pressing enough, and this, was a new and horrid nightmare. This place is very old and not kept up. I've traveled before and never had this kind of experience, ever. Motel 6 is five stars over this dump. Do not even think about this place, ever. My booking in advance didn't matter, and I was very specific about my time of arrival, and then left to kill time, til 'they' had my room ready. Which was hrs later forcing me to rush and be stressed even moreso, after traveling, packing, etc. One window was taped with clear postal tape, shut. The other side, was hard to open, to allow fresh air in. It was a dangerous to customer, neglected place, and the worst. I was in fear of my own safety, in fear of being broken into the room, during the night due to the postal taped window, which wasn't repaired, and subjected one to such fear. If I wasn't so pressed for time, I wouldn't have 'settled' for this.. and perhaps I shouldn't have and been late to my engagement, and gone elsewhere... and I sure do regret not doing that. This place needs to be remodeled or condemned, it was just that bad.DO NOT GO to this place, it was awful and I concurr with others who've reviewed this place and they're correct about their own experience.	
Apr 9 2004	Just bloody aweful in every way	About ten years ago I used to stay here often. It has gone down hill in a big way. I stayed at Roberts Motel on April 6th. I was appalled by how bad is was:Flithy WallsBig globs of snot smeared on the wallNo TV remoteThe most uncomfortable pillows ever, anywherePeeling paint and huge patches of falling wallpaperCould hear every sound in adjacent roomJust awefull in every way!	
Feb 20 2004	Never again!	All I can say is that I was warned by the previous reviews. But I made my plans to visit San Francisco at the last moment, and the other hotels close by were either booked up or had only smoking rooms available. So I took the room at Robert's, only to find that my &quot;non-smoking&quot; room reeked of smoke.Roberts Motel is the loudest, worst motel I have ever stayed in. I could hear the couple in the room next door playing some strange game until after 11:00 p.m.-- she kept shouting, &quot;Seven, seven, seven!&quot;--and then they started arguing with one another at 7:00 a.m. The walls are so paper-thin that I could tell when the woman was speaking while brushing her teeth. I finally banged on the wall when I heard the man clearing the mucus from his throat, spitting it out in the sink, and then burping.All the information in the previous reviews regarding the noise of cars, trains, buses and diesel trucks is accurate. I was awakened all night long. But I don't think I would have slept anyway with the &quot;pillow&quot; on my bed which was about 1 1/2 inches thick. I rolled it up into a tube and used it as a neck roll.The only positive thing I can say is that the staff at the desk were polite and efficient. I didn't bother to tell them about my dissatisfaction because nothing short of razing the building to the ground could improve the place.	
Oct 18 2003	Look Elsewhere!!!	Thought I'd try the Robert's Motel since I know the area. Big mistake!!! Manager's teenage daughter came back to the parking lot about 1:30 a.m. with a large group of rowdy friends and decided to have a party! Tried calling office to no avail - had to call SFPD! Poor construction leads to poor night sleep since you can hear your neighbor's televisions. Next time I'll spend the extra ten bucks on the Days Inn a half-block away! Stayed there before and it's much cleaner!!!	
Aug 14 2003	Loved sleeping by the sea	Roberts-At-The-Beach Motel is a worthwhile motel w/ rates of $75 Sun-Thu, $85 Fri-Sat. The biggest drawback is the traffic noise. There was no A/C in my room as your really don't need it but when a diesel truck is parked nearby, the engine noise is annoying if you're looking for peace and quiet. Also, you can't have the window curtain open without the passerbys being able to see you. The biggest plus is the location: only a block and a half away from the beach. There are small restaurants close by and the Zoo across the street. There are stops adjacent to the motel for the bus and Metro train that comes every 10 minutes. As tourism is high in S.F., it looks advisable to have reservations for weekend stays.	
Dec 18 2002	A great lodging experience	Quaint rooms give that cozy comfortable feeling as you take in the ocean breeze and listen to the surf as it peacefully puts you to sleep. Across the street is the zoo and you wake up listing to the animals. The staff is extremely curtious and helpfull. One can see they take pride in providing the best experience for their customers. Very clean. Public transportation to all locations are just a step away from the motel. I recommend Roberts at the Beach to everyone visiting San Francisco.
