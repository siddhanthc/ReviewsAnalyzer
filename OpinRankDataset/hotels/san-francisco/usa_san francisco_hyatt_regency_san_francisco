	Nice location - but not up to Hyatt Regency Standards	Pros:- Outstanding location on Embarcedero Drive and across from the Ferry Building- Large &amp; Beautiful Atrium- Large RoomsCons:- Rooms are dated, worn out- Bathrooms are not clean- Service was adequateWe stayed at the Hyatt Regency in other cities and I would like to say that this is a nice hotel, but not quite worth the price to stay. The initial impressions of the hotel were good, an incredibly 10+ story atrium with hanging lights and global ball greeted us. The hotel location is superior with a close walk to Chinatown, Financial District, and Fisherman's Wharf. However checking into our room, I must admit that the rooms were sub-standard for a Hyatt Regency hotel. The big problem we had was with the old, worn out look and feel of the room. The carpet was stained and rough -most likely because it hadn't been replaced in a while. The bathroom fixtures were old and an eyesore. Old fixtures and noticeable hair in the bathroom didn't leave a positive impression. It didn't help that the dim lighting in the bathroom and entry way didn't give the room a &quot;bright&quot; look. Bed sheets were rough and not the typical &quot;fluffy&quot; high-thread count for linens. The room was really a big downer. We didn't try many of the on-site services except the fitness room and it was very bare with a couple treadmills and reclining bikes and light weights. The new Stay Fit fitness center wasn't opened at the time so the fitness facility could be better next time.For the dollar's worth, I wouldn't recommend the Hyatt Regency. If any reason, you would want to stay here for the location but that's pretty much it.	
Nov 20 2009 	Good Deal for Downtown Hotel	I am not a big fan for staying in downtown SFO but for those who are this is a fine choice (especially for a $79 Hotwire special). It is adjacent to the Embarcadero stop and right and across the street from the waterfront so many may find it appealing. Not a lot going on during weekends in that area however.The building is huge and is one of the well known atrium hotels in the US. Check in was quick and efficient. The room is generally very nice and modern with a high quality bed, tv and furniture. There is a doorwall that opened to a scenic 6th floor view. The shower in the bathroom was pretty basic however and our shower nozzle was broken so you had to stand directly beneath it. The weight room was average at best for a hotel of that size, but I believe they were in the process of moving the facility so there may be an upgrade in the near future. The hotel is connected to the Embarcadero Center which has many shops and restaurants but they generally have limited weekend hours.Overall a good choice for staying downtown especially at a discounted price.	
Nov 15 2009 	Cavernous impersonal amazing balcony	This hotel is exactly what we expected - cavernous and impersonal. A mention that we were celebrating our 30th wedding anniversary and a birthday brought not a flicker of reaction. But we wanted a view and a balcony without breaking the bank and the Hyatt Regency gave us a great location with wonderful outdoor space. The AAA rate made a balcony suite affordable. The space in the suite, with a separate living room, two bathrooms and a 30' balcony was enjoyable. The outdated decor, stained carpet and $10 per day internet fee, not so much. But the bus, BART, cable cars and F-line are all right outside, making it easy to get anywhere. The Ferry building right across the street provided nice restaurants and shopping when we were too tired to trek anywhere else. If you don't care about personal service and can get a reasonable rate, this is a good choice.	
Nov 14 2009 	huge business-oriented hotel	This is a well-run, even oiled machine of a conference hotel. No surprises; you get what you pay for (OK, a little more, with Bay views). Not for romance, but pretty much good for every other kind of travel. It often comes up on Priceline (which is how I got my room). The fitness center was a little disappointing, but I know I'm picky in that regard. It does have a fair number of aerobic machines	
Nov 10 2009 	A Bargain	Stayed two nights at Hyatt Regency Embarcadero Center. Ezxcellent location across from Ferry Market, near great restaurants (Ozumo, Slanted Door, Tadich Grill, Yank Sing, among others). For $235 we had an executive king junior suite with a bay view. Much less expensive than Hotel Vitale, around the corner.	
Nov 5 2009 	DON"T GET A RENT CAR (Parking and parking tickets cost to much)	Our stay was in August 09 I was not too impressed. We booked this stay with Expedia and while on the phone verifying some of the info verbally I asked if it cost to park in the parking garage... the expedia guy says NO. I tell him if it cost to park (we were only staying two nights in downtown S.F.) I would like to delay the pick up on the rent car I don't want to pay to park then take public transportation the whole time we are there. He assures me there is no parking fees if staying at the hotel so I agreed to go ahead and take the rent car the two days. My husband and I get there very late that night we pull up to the valet and the guy tells us it is like $35.00 plus per night to park and it's like two in the morning I told him I was not expecting to pay for parking so he tells us to park right across the street in front of the Walgreen Pharmacy on the street just make sure we get up early like 6:00 or 7:00 am and put money in the meter and it would be much cheaper so we do that. The next morning my husband gets up and runs outside to put money in the meter which he does and everything is going good UNTIL he comes back up to the room and we are getting ready for the day and he looks out the window down on the street and says Hey what's that cop doing by our rent car. We both laughed and continued getting ready. ( Oh by the way we are on the 8th floor looking down on the street by the Walgreen's I had also asked the expedia guy for a room with a view and this was the view we got...Walgreens) As my husband and I get to our rent car to start our first day in San Francisco we notice a nice little piece of paper under the windshield wiper. Yes, we got a parking ticket for $73.00 because we parked in a loading zone by Walgreens. So the next night we just decide to go and pay the parking in the parking garage. That was approx $54.00 for the night. So don't get a car if you are staying in the city.As far as the hotel it was very dated the bathroom was not what I thought I should get at a Hyatt Hotel. It looked more like a Holiday Inn bathroom very small. The hotel itself seemed cold to me. Not welcoming.	
Oct 25 2009 	Great Location comfortable room	My wife and I stayed for 2 nights. It was real easy to get to. We took the BART from San Francisco Airport to the Embarcadero Stop, and it was right there. The staff was very personable at check in. Our room, while a far from the elevator, was spacious with an obstructed, but good view of the Ferry Building. We received a great deal with Priceline, so I wasn't expecting any view. The room was clean. Sink was out side the bathroom area, which is always good. Great bagel place, Noah's bagels and Starbucks just outside if you want a relatively cheap breakfast, not to mention the entire Ferry Building just a short walk away. The F street car was also very close by, which takes you along the piers to Fisherman's Wharf or the Civic Center area. Also, there is a Cable Car turn-around just outside. Everything went smoothly!	
Oct 23 2009 	Expected more for price of rooms	Stayed at Hyatt Regency for 8 days (mixed pleasure with business); &quot;conference rate&quot; of $249/night was high, in my opinion. Room size on 9th floor was adequate, bathroom was poor for the quality I expected from this hotel - small, old-looking, toiletries nothing to write home about; great floor to ceiling window that was actually a sliding door, allowing me to get fresh air further enjoy a partial view of the Bay Bridge. After 2 nights, asked for another room due to rattling HVAC vent and &quot;whistling&quot; pipe in the wall behind the bed. Also given $20/night discount after I asked for it. Moved to 14th floor with straight-on view of the clock tower over the Ferry Bldg. - gorgeous view!!! Staff was friendly and helpful, so all in all a pleasant stay.	
Oct 23 2009 	They stolen my jewelry	I was first very impressed by this hotel. It looked great inside. I started worrying when the main came every morning at 8 am and tried entering the room without knocking at the door.The last day before leaving I forget all my jewelry in the desk drawer and they only return part of them. The stole the most valuable one (platinum) which were just given to me by my husband on my last anniversary. If you decide to stay here lock your belongings in the safe case and make sure you don't forget anything in the room when you check out.	
Oct 23 2009 	What's the hype about the Hyatt?	We choose to stay at this hotel because it was supposed to have a great resturant. We get ready to go have dinner and the only resturant open on Monday was a sports bar! Needles to say no quiet dinner when it's Monday night football! Had they had it posted that the nice resturant was only Thursday, Friday, &amp; Saturday we would have stayed somewhere else! Oh, and the staff was not very friendly!	
Oct 22 2009 	Lovely view and a large room in a perfect location	We stayed just 2 nights, but it was pretty much perfect. The location on the Embarcadero was great for us, because we wanted to visit the Saturday morning market at the Ferry building, and we wanted to dine at Boulevard (just 2 blocks away!).Our room was an &quot;Embarcadero suite&quot; . It was very large, with a big sitting area -- 2 couches, coffee table, desk, large flat screen tv-- and a king size bed with another flat screen tv on the dresser. We had an incredible view of the ferry building, the bay and the Bay Bridge. The room has sliders along the long wall, that open up for fresh air and the tremendous view (not a real balcony, but there are concrete rails so you can open the doors up).The breakfast buffet is a bit expensive, but top notch. Room service dinner was really good too.	
Oct 21 2009 	Good Value	Good value and very good location. We stayed for 2 nights after a trip to Napa and we're quite satisfied.	
Oct 21 2009 	Great hotel if you can get a deal	My girlfriend and I stayed at this hotel last weekend and we really enjoyed it. Some of the advice we read in previous reviews really helped. Here are some ways you can save money....Booking: We booked on Priceline and what would've cost us around $300 a night ended up costing us $95 a night. When we got to hotel, the reservation agent asked us if we wanted a bay view for an additional $40 a night. We said no and still had a killer view (see pic).Transportation: Instead of renting a car and paying outrageous parking fees, we took the BART instead. It dropped us off in front of the hotel. A taxi ride would've cost us around $40 one way. The BART was $16 for both of us one way.Internet: Use the &quot;Business Center&quot; instead of the internet in your room. It's cheaper if you only need it for a short time (printing boarding passes, etc.)Minibar: We had no need for it, so we didn't touch it for fear of activating it. We were not charged.Anyway, the staff was friendly and the rooms were clean. The outside noise did come in through the window, but we knew we were in the middle of the financial district. Oh, one last thing, I would recommend using public transportation to get around. It's very inexpensive and it seems that locals take advantage of it.	
Oct 16 2009	Comfortable Stay with Great Views	The Hyatt Regency's rooms facing the Bay Bridge offer quite amazing views, and the fact that the sliding windows open adds to that pleasure. Make a visit to the Regency Club Lounge, and you'll be visually mesmorized by the panorama of Treasure Island and the spans across the Bay. The lobby is expansive, the food well prepared, the wait staff average, and the fitness center compact yet utilitarian. Rooms and furnishings are fairly standard size, with small baths and a vanity outside the bathroom with generous counterspace. The location near the Embarcadero and Ferry Building is great, and artisans pitch their wares in the open areas on weekends. Parking is outrageous in San Francisco, so if you can get it included in a package, it's a significant value. Proximity to Union Square, Nob Hill and all the other sights is great, and a BART station is across the street. This is a solid Hyatt experience, but service could be a bit more friendly and anticipatory.	
Oct 15 2009 	Awesome location everything else is just so-so	I got a great price on this hotel on Priceline, but if I had paid full price my review would be much worse then I am going to write.The location is convenient, as everyone else has said. The room was clean and the beds were fairly comfortable. I did enjoy the ipod dock. The TV was a joke, it is a nice flat screen TV hooked up to a very mediocre cable system that affords very poor picture quality - so what's the point, might as well have had an old 19 inch color tv in there. The bathroom was very small and cramped, and had no exhaust fan. In addition, our tub was backing up when we took a shower, which is VERY annoying to me. Fortunately, we called maintenance and they came in a few hours while we were out and cleared the blockage.Noise-wise this hotel is an absolute joke. We could hear noise from the atrium, noise from outside, and noise from the room above us, lots of pounding, slamming, etc. There is zero insulation in this place, and if you're the type of person who likes to go to bed early, or sleep in late, this place may not be good for you. The sliding glass door to the non-existent balcony is a joke. It didn't close all the way and lacked proper insulation and bone chilling cold air was blowing into our room from outside (not to mention all the street noise), even with the door fully closed. I do not recommend staying on a low floor in this hotel as you will get the atrium and street noise, but they wouldn't give us any other room in the hotel. This hotel nickel and dimes you to death. Parking is $58 bucks. Internet is $10 a day! Don't even think of touching the mini bar, it has sensors in it that will charge you automatically if you even move anything, which sucks because I often like to use the mini bar to store a few of my own items. ;) BTW, the carpet in the hallways is stained. In addition, they have extension cords running across the carpet, and taped down, very tacky looking! There is no pool apparently, not that you could use one in SFO unless it was indoors. The fitness center is closed still and they will kindly give you a discount card for a nearby fitness center, but they charge $10 a day! And last but certainly not least, the maid actually barged into our room without knocking one day, and I was naked. That situation was awkward to say the least!!!!	
Oct 13 2009 	Great hotel and fantastic location!	This is a very nice hotel close to everything or has easy access to public transportation. We had a great view of the bay and Ferry Building.	
Oct 12 2009 	Unbelievable value...if you can get it	San Francisco was the first city we booked accomodation for on our 2 week Californian holiday because we found a deal - Friday / Saturday night for $69 and Sunday night for $99 - that we simply couldn't turn down. Not only was the Hyatt Regency in the perfect location for us with stunning views of the Bay and easy access to the Ferry building, but the hotel, with its uber-impressive lobby, was even in our guide book! The cheap cost may be a result of 70s architecture no longer being in vogue or the fact that the hotel shop was being renovated and a larger fitness centre being installed (although the small machine and weights room available more than met our needs) or it might just be the recession, but whatever the reason at rock-bottom prices and with those views its definitely a great base from which to explore SF!	
Oct 10 2009 	Nice but anoymous	We stayed at the Hyatt Regency in San Francisco August 21 - 25, 2009. When making the reservation, I had specifically asked for an upper room with a king bed. The special that I was booking under had indicated rooms in levels 1-12 were available and I made a special request for this upper room when I called and it was confirmed on the reservation confirmation. The reservation was made several months in advance so I had anticipated no problem getting the room we requested. Upon arrival we were told the only rooms available were on the first floor. It was a disappointment to say the least. Also, be warned that the mini-bars in these rooms are monitored electronically. If you move anything, it is recorded as a purchase. If you want your own refrigerator, it is an additional $15/day. To be fair however, when we called the front desk to inform them we had accidentally moved some items, they did not charge us. It just seems a little chinzy for a major hotel chain to not allow it's customer's to use an in-room refrigerator. I dont' believe this was mentioned in the room description. The room itself was nice. It was large, clean and comfortable. The in-room bath products smell horrible though and we ended up going to Walgreens across the street to purchase our own. If you like big,chain hotels and/or are own a frequent quest program with them, it wouldn't be a bad place to stay. But with all the lovely boutique hotels in San Francisoco that provide personalized service, this would not be my first choice place.	
Oct 8 2009 	Beautiful place to photograph...	I have to start off that this place is beuatiful, day or night to test your camera's limits. The angles, the scuplture, the lighting, the elevators, even the views from the window were great. The loaction is a great spot to head out in any direction and just to get lost in &quot;the city&quot;. Drinks were great. My only real complaint was that I guess either there were a lot of guests breaking rules and still smoking intheir rooms or there was so much smoking done there in the past, that it had that old, smokey scent. Being asthmatic and having allergies, and that &quot;old smokey&quot; scent didn't work out well for me. I ended up sick every morning and night that I stayed there. Other than that, the service was great, the room was clean and comfortable and the pictures spoke for themselves.	
Oct 8 2009 	love the room 	We stayed at the Hyatt Regency in August and enjoyed our stay very much. We arrived late, around 9pm and I asked for an upgrade...at first she said they were fully booked, then she said &quot;let me see what I can do&quot;....we were upgraded to a business type room I think. It was fully renovated, had a little sitting area, the carpet was so clean..just overall very modern and nice. We enjoyed our room very much, we have a 16 month old so the room was a nice place for him to run around. It had a balcony too.The location was nice because it was walking distance to Union Square and China Town. We just had a great time.	
Oct 8 2009 	Nice hotel. Clean and quiet.	Went here and a business trip. I thought the hotel was quiet and clean. The cleaning staff was good.	
Oct 8 2009 	Loved every second!	This hotel was great. It had very clean rooms that were large, which was a nice change from the typical small hotel rooms in San Francisco. The location was amazing and we were near everything that we wanted to be near (Pier 39, Ghiradelli Square, shopping). The only downside would be parking here. You would be lucky if you find a spot in the street and if you do, watch out for parking tickets and if you aren't parking on the street the only alternative is valet parking which is 55 a day. Other than that, great hotel!	
Oct 3 2009 	Great Hyatt Experience	Just returned from a vacation with my spouse. Was very pleased with the Hyatt. The front desk associate was very friendly and upgraded us to a room with a balcony and a harbor view. He said it was because we were staying for a week and we were nice. (I got the impression that most of the business travelers are in a rush and rather rude). The lobby and atrium are beautiful with a large sculpture and running stream. The room was a good size and clean. Bed was comfortable with decent linens and lots of pillows. Bathroom was smallish but adequate. Sink and counter were outside the toilet/shower area. The hotel was full, several conferences, but we didn't hear much noise and slept well. We stayed with a AAA special and had breakfast included. Most mornings we had the buffet which had many good selections. On the weekend they had made to order omelets. A couple of mornings we ordered from the menu. This area of San Francisco is very nice as it borders the financial district. The Ferry Building is a short walk down the street. The cable car stops just outside the hotel and the trolley and subway were also very close. There are a few restaurants and stores within walking distance and many more a little further walk away. Chinatown is a short cable car ride up the hill (we walked back as it was all down hill). We took a couple of bus tours; one to Muir Woods/Sausalito that picked us up at the hotel. Another tour to Napa Wine country picked us up at the Ferry Building. Pier 39 and Fisherman's Wharf is a short trolley ride that can be picked up in front of the Ferry Building. This was a great location for seeing the city. (Be warned however, there are homeless people everywhere even in the best locations)	
Oct 1 2009 	Ideal location nice rooms friendly people. What more is there?	Just returned from a 1 x night stay at the Hyatt Regency as a stop over to Canada. As I was only going to be there for 1 x day I wanted somewhere close to the action &amp; easy to get to &amp; from the international airport. The Hyatt ticked all the boxes.Being directly on a BART station from the airport was perfect. Also very easy walk to the harbour, markets and other sites. The room was quiet, clean and very comfortable and larger than I expected. I certainly have no complaints and would happily stay here again.	
Oct 1 2009 	Really is this really the Hyatt SF	I can't believe this hotel is consider a Hyatt. When I hear the Hyatt name I expect a pleasant hotel experince. That is definatly not what I recieved. I made reservations and paid extra for a Bay View room. What a joke, it was a particial bay view that could only be seen on from the outside balcony and when I leaned over the rail. I guess there is a place called the Regency Club at the top of the hotel with a great view of the city but it extra $75.00 a day. What a joke, I already spent almost $300.00 per night for a basic room with a so called &quot;Bay View&quot; and bad service. Don't forget there is an extra charge of $57.00 per night for valet parking. If you don't mind a little walk the parking garage is only $32.00 a night.The ONLY thing I can say nice about this hotel is the location. The location is nice and close to shopping and the pier.	
Sep 28 2009	great atrium close to piers	we got an ok rate on hotwire- about $200 for 4 star. Parking is $ 50 extra. One big disappointment was that the people in the next room started smoking and really made our room gross starting in the middle of the night. We got 2 different stories from staff and no meaningful redress. Changing room was too late. It didn't seem as though they were going to check it out and put a stop to it. The rest of the hotel is pretty classy. It was probably really hot at one time but now the staff enthusiasm is running at about 75%. Good but not exceptional.	
Sep 21 2009 	Glass lifts atrium and fabulous harbour views	Well situated 4* hotel. WE flew into SFO and used BART to travel into the City $8.10 each way. Station right outside the hotel. Doesn't look much from the outside but stunning internal atrium. Helpful reception staff and concierge desk. Upgraded to harbour view with balcony (deal on at the time) after getting a book 2 get one night free with Expedia. Well equipped good sized room, nice to be able to sit out on balcony. Close to all amenities, cable cars stop right outside. Buy MUNI pass if you are there a couple of days (ask reception for directions). Saturday morning Farmers Market on the harbour front - well worth a stroll around, lots of things to try. Only downside having to pay for internet - come on Hyatt, if Holiday Inn Express can give this for free, you need to look at this again!!	
Sep 21 2009 	Excellent location and value	Stayed for 3 nights in September 2009. Got a deal via Hyatt's own website for £51 per night. What a bargain. The room had been updated recently, was clean and we had a view of the Ferry Building too. Comfortable beds. Nice toiletries. It's in a great spot for enjoying the facilities of the Ferry Building, walking to Fisherman's Wharf and even for exploring the rest of the City. Trolley bus stop right outisde and only a couple of minutes from the Embarcedero train stop. Quiet and relaxing.	
Sep 17 2009 	4 Days at the Hyatt Regency	I recently spent a few nights at the Hyatt Regency San Francisco. We really enjoyed this property, mostly because of the location. It is right on the Embarcadero, which has easy access to trollies, restaurants, museums, and farmer's market. NUTSHELL: Pros- Excellent Location, Close to a ton of restaurants, Ferry Building Cons-Parking price is criminal in some states, No Pool, Small roomsI will be brief....if you are looking for an exclusive, ultra-trendy hotel, this is NOT it. Try the new Intercontinental, or maybe a W hotel. What this hotel DOES offer is an ideal location, close to almost everything. Fisherman's Wharf is a little bit of a walk, but it is a two dollar trolly. The hotel itself is very well kept, with an impressive lobby. The layout of the corridors and rooms is a bit odd, and the room we stayed in was on the small side. We did have an amazing balcony, with view of the Ocean and Embarcadero. I highly recommend upgrading to the Regency Club floor, as we had appetizers each night as well as breakfast each morning. It should be illegal to charge as much as they do at the Hyatt for parking, so my advise is to continue down Drumm Street, past the Hyatt, and turn right down Clay street. Self parking was about $30 a night there, and a 2 minute walk to the hotel. Save yourself over $20 a night!If we return to San Francisco, we would definitely consider staying here again, as it was great service, amazing location, and an overall good value for what we paid. Hope this review helps!Tyson Brohman[--]	
Sep 14 2009 	Lovely room lovely views steps from Bart.	Served up right. Pleasant staff, great transportation availability, clean comfortable rooms.Stayed at club level which provide nice views, snacks etc. Enjoyed our stay and would stay there again. Couldn't ask for more.	
Sep 9 2009	Average Conference Hotel	My teenage daughter and I stayed at the Hyatt Embarcadero for three nights. We selected this hotel based on the location near the Ferry Building and we were not disappointed. This was a great location and we also enjoyed being close to Union Square but not in the midst of a lot of congestion. This is a very large hotel and somewhat impersonal. The front desk staff is quite abrupt and we did not find them that interested in helping us except for when they were trying to upsell us to a more expensive room (which they eventually did). Although I had requested a &quot;quiet&quot; room (we are a Hyatt Rewards member) we were assigned a room that was on the busy street side and we could hear the doormen blowing their whistle for the taxi every few minutes as well as a lot of street noise including buses and the transit system/trolley. When I inquired about another room they told me the only way to get a quieter room was to upgrade (and spend another $40 per night). It was clear that we were going to need to do this. The new room was much better - faced the Embarcadero and we could also see the bay/water. This room had a spacious balcony which we really liked. It was quite quiet except for this room had the capacity to be a connecting room and we could hear the gentleman next door talking on his phone and listening to either the radio or tv through the double doors - not very soundproof. Luckily he went to bed on the early side. The gym was decent and had a couple of elliptical trainers and bikes along with some weight equipment. One morning we went to the lobby for breakfast - first it was really expensive (the buffet was $25 per person) so for the two of us it was $50. The selection was okay but not worth the cost. You were able to special order eggs other than scrambled and I ordered an over easy egg. When it was delivered it was not completely cooked. When I brought it to the server's attention, she proceeded to give me a lecture on how to order eggs to the point where other patrons were watching. (It appears that I should have ordered over easy medium/well done, if you order plain over easy it means undercooked/watery). The server had a very haughty attitude and we were sure not to return there during our visit. The movie selections in the room were good and the beds were fine. The bathroom and the carpeting could use some upgrading as they appear a little worn and the bathroom is small.The valet was pleasant but hailed a cab for us that another guest rejected (supposedly because it did not take credit cards) but actually turned out to have a horrible odor like the driver lived in his cab/had not showered for days. It appeared that he knew that driver as he was conversing with him before we got it. Although it was chilly we had to keep the windows down for the entire ride to the airport. I am not sure that I would stay here again unless I was attending a conference. I think there are probably better places to stay in the area. It was not overall a pleasant experience.	
Sep 8 2009 	This Has to be the Best in San Francisco if you want to have fun!	We were in this hotel over the long Labor Day weekend. Everyone and everything was perfect. The location was perfect to venture anywhere. We did not eat in the hotel due to the bad reviews on this site. However, we ate closeby and were not disappointed. If you tour all day, cross the street to the Ferry Building and buy freshly made cheese, freshly made bread and a bottle of wine and enjoy the view from your hotel window.	
Sep 7 2009 	Loved this hotel. Very close to public transportation	My husband and I really enjoyed our four night stay at the Hyatt Regency August 28-September 1. I booked with my AAA card for the rate of 119 for 3 nights and the last night was around 135 without taxes. I asked for a king sized non-smoking room, without no connecting door, and a room on a high floor to avoid the street noise. We ended up staying on the 14th floor facing Market Street and had no problems with street noise. I would ask for a high floor room if you are concerned with street noise and let them know that when you check in at the front desk. I explained that I was somewhat a light sleeper and needed a room that wouldn't be too noisy. Transportation- I was so amazed that when we arrived from the BART the hotel was right there. We exited the BART station and walked up the steps and could see the hotel. I had no idea it would be that close. The MUNI bus and one of the cable cars is also right there. We used the MUNI and the BART. We used public transportation the entire time on our trip. The ride from the SFO airport on the BART was about a half hour. Room- The room was somewhat small, but it wasn't too bad for two people. The room was clean and the bed was very comfy!! Rooms were taken care of daily. One thing I found a little strange when we arrived at the hotel is that there was pee in the toilet and toilet paper. I asked the front desk about this and they explained someone from housekeeping would make sure the bathroom was cleaned. Food- We ate two mornings at the Noah's Bagels below the hotel. Walgreen's, Starbucks, Taco Bell Express, and a place called Burger Bistro (serves breakfast &amp; lunch) is directly across the street. There are also many other food selections at the Ferry Station across the street. We ate at a very good Mexican Restaurant there one night.Location- You are mainly in the Financial District so it seems like most things were closed around 9-10 pm it seemed. Chinatown is about a 15 minute walk away and a 3 minute bus ride. Overall- I really enjoyed my stay here at the hotel and would definitely stay here again when we visit. The front desk staff were extremely friendly and would go out of their way to help you. The hotel does offer a breakfast buffet each morning for the cost of around 25 per person. There is also a bar in the lobby area also. The glass elevators were fun and we never had to wait on them.	
Sep 3 2009 	A premium but not luxurious hotel with a great location 	We stayed at the Hyatt Regency on our way to a week in Sonoma so I could finish up some business there and enjoy a weekend in San Francisco. This hotel has great weekend rates and we booked a top floor, Regency floor bayside view room for $149 a night with my Hyatt Platinum and AAA memberships. We stayed in room 1714 and it had a great view of the Bay Bridge and the Ferry Building below. The lady who checked us in, Kathleen, was very polished and welcoming. We valet parked our car-in spite of the $50 parking fee, parking in San Francisco is very expensive anywhere and a parking ticket is $73 minimum so with in and out priveleges, and our plans to drive up to Twin Peaks, Lombard Street, the beaches and Pacific Heights, we wanted that flexibility.The hotel is updated 70's genre in a way that I'm sure will become classic over time. The glass elevators were featured in the movie &quot;Earthquake&quot; and are a bit of a thrill as they whisk you up to the 17th floor. The floors up to floor 15 have a different grade of decor from the 16ht and 17th floor. Our room was small by our own standards ( looked to be around 300 sf) but every inch was used well and decorated nicely in a contemporary way, with dark woods, nice stone floors and tile in the entry and bath areas and a &quot;Mirror TV&quot; inset in the bathroom mirror, that is nice for watching news or golf while you're shaving. The towels and toiletries were organized very nicely in Pottery Barn style bins beneath the sink. The bedroom had a nice flat screen TV but 2 things we didn't like were the sliding doors that only open one inch (the are bolted so they don't open any wider-I guess to prevent jumpers) and the ceiling height is uncomforably low. The building almost feels like a honeycomb of hotel rooms.We didn't use the mini bar as the Regency Club upstairs had just about everything we needed in the way of water, juices and drinks.The Regency Club is an nice perk with great views. There is at least one employee always on duty during club hours and they were very accomodating. The breakfast presentations up there were very adequate with yougurts, fruits and cereals as well as smoked salmon, bagels and all the trimmings. On the weekends they actually are trying to &quot;up it a notch&quot; by adding bands and dancing until midnight for Regency Club members. If you are relying on public transporation, there is no better place to stay because right outside the hotel is BART access to the airport and BART routes, Ferry connections across the Bay, Cable Car stops and plenty of taxi's. Union Square is just a few blocks away and the Ferry Building has some great shops and restaurants. Just up the street is Tadich Grill, probably on of the best seafood places in SF, as well as the Carnelian Room-a great place for drinks on the 55th floor of the Bank Of America Building. Chinatown is only four blocks up the street on California and Grant and Nob Hill is a cable car ride away ( or a 10 block walk uphill). You can actually catch the cable car stop up there to the Fishermans Wharf/ Union Square cable car-very handy.We had brunch on Sunday at the Mark Hopkins, an experience I'd highly recommend. The food is excellent with limitless champagne and caviar and some very nice brunch choices and the most incredible view of San Francisco. Over the years we've stayed a lot of places in San Francisco and I have to admit that staying on the 18th floor of the Fairmont tower is still probably my favorite place.The Hyatt Regency is a true business hotel, more than a luxury hotel-more Toyota Avalon than Lexus but the service is great, and for the $149 price ( for their best rooms) you just couldn't beat it. And just one parting thought-if you call down to the valet about 10 minutes before you head down, they'll usually have your car ready-seemed to be the case for us the 8 or 9 times we needed our car.	
Sep 3 2009 	Nice Location but Noisy	Hotel is situated in a decent location however was very noisy! The parking was overly expensive. You can avoid paying an extra $22 valet fee by parking opposite the hotel yourself. We could hear the traffic all night. Staff were good but concierge was a mixed bag. Room service was a little slow but accomodating. The one thing I would avoid here at all costs is the rental desk. Possibly the worst rental service you can imagine. Under staffed, long queues and I ended up running around San Fran to pick up a Sat Nav and baby seat because they didnt have even after reserving. Totally useless. Rooms were a reasonable size, in fact quite large. Hotel was overall well kept, modern and comfortable. Not sure I would stay again but was still very good.	
Sep 2 2009 	okay	Got the room through priceline at a good price. Valet parking $57/day with slow service (u need to inform them half an hour before you need the car). Solution: just next block $32/day. No free Internet, they charge you 11/day. IF YOU OPEN THE REFRIGERATOR you are charged for the content. So you cannot buy a beer or water bottle to cool it in your room's fridge witout being charged. That sucks.Great location: public transportation/walk to all attractions. Super deal buying for $59 the City Pass that gives you 7 days of free rides on any buses+ entrance to five attractions. Worth every penny. As a leisure client you &quot;feel&quot; you are not as welcome as bussines clients in this hotel. Paying 100-120/night and parking next door is the right value.	
Sep 1 2009 	Great hotel convenient location	We stayed at the Hyatt Regency on Embarcadero Street in the Financial District for 3 nights, 4 day from Aug. 28-31, 2009. LocationThe hotel is located in the Financial District and very convenient for public transportation (which I would recommend since parking is expensive). We grabbed the BART train from the airport and arrived directly in front of the hotel in about 35 minutes. The fare was $8.10 one way, very reasonable. As soon as we emerged from the station, the hotel was right in front of us (on Drumm Street side).In terms of nearby attractions, the Ferry Buiding is right across the street and contains many shops, restaurants, etc. They had a farmers market which was great with fresh fruit, pastries, etc.. on certain days in the morning. To Fisherman's Wharf 39 and 43, it is about 30 minute walk along the scenic route. You can also hop on the MUNI F line, which is a couple of bucks and very convenient. To Chinatown, the walk is about 10 minutes. Nob Hill, Union Square and all others are walkable, but could also be easily reached via MUNI or taxi.Exterior/InteriorThe exterior is very well maintained and attractive. The atrium was beautifully decorated-very clean and professional. There is a restaurant, concierge, and other amenities located there. Our room on the 9th floor was clean, fresh and had a decent view of the downtown building as well as the bay bridge. We booked online and got an excellent rate of about $90 (!!) so it was truly a bargain.ServiceService was great. The check in process was very easy and the staff were helpful and fast. Our room was cleaned on a daily basis and everything we needed was provided-- coffee, tea, toiletries, flat panel TV, Internet, Ipod radio, magazines, paper, etc.. Check out was a snap.	
Sep 1 2009 	Great location in a hilly city	Stayed at the Hyatt Hotel Embarcadero, San Francisco for three nights in August while visiting family. Although I don't usually stay in such upscale hotels in San Francisco, the price was right. I had bid for a room on Priceline and they accepted my bid of considerably less than $100.00 per night. The location was great for me as I have knee problems and cannot handle hills.The entrance to the subway, both Muni and BART is about 300 feet from the hotel. This allows for easy access via BART to and from the airport. The ride from airport to hotel takes about 30 minutes and the cost is currently $8.10 one way. Also the Ferry Building with all its shops and restaurants is just across the street. The hotel bed was comfortable and on my first night I stayed on the 15th floor. This room was very quiet for being in the financial district. We left town for a few days and upon returning to the city and to this same Hyatt I was given a room on the 9th floor. This room was not as quiet as the first but not bad. I was awakened at about 4:00 am one morning by a &quot;yeller&quot; that I suspected might be by the cable cars. I'd heard of him before. After about 45 minutes, he stopped. The carpet was stained in one spot in this second room, but still the bed was comfortable.Both times when I registered I asked for a room with a Bay view if possible. Both times I was told the cost for that would be an additional $40.00 and I refused. My bargain was too precious to give up when I could go sit by Peet's Coffee Shop across the street and view the Bay. In the first room I did have a view of the Trans America building and enjoyed that. In all, my experience was very good and a great value for such this landmark, pyramid shaped hotel.	
Aug 25 2009 	Excellent choice without a car	Stayed here mid August with a 97$ per night ( priceline) stay. THe room was very clean and comfy- was nice to open the window.t Bathroom a bit small but so what. All of the transport services are right outside the door and the Ferry building with its great food options and fantastic Farmers Market was unbeatable. Took the bus a few minutes up to Union Square shopping. Califnia Cable car was never crowded like the Powell St. Line and goes right into China town. Took muni across town to GG Park . Took the historic F line trolleys up and down the Wharf.Concierge was a bit new i think but nice and when tryling to pay for wireless i had to call the tech support who then gave me the wireless for free !! I must say i would never pay full price for this room and did miss a fridge and if i had a car i would never pay for the parking but with out a car it cant be beat. Did not use room service or hotel restaurant- too much good food nearby!!! We got a room on 3rd floor which was a bit loud at times but got a nice bay bridge view.	
Aug 22 2009 	Great Hotel	The Hyatt Regency was the perfect stay for us. Great location, cool architecture and a nice bar.The hotel was central to everywhere we wanted to go and walking distance to lots of places. We booked the wine country tour and the meeting place for the group was the Ferry Building, which was just across the street from the hotel! They also had a great bar and served great drinks. The sangrias were so good we ordered pitchers at a time!One major con of the hotel was the parking - they charger $50 per night! Outrageous! But the next time I'm in San Francisco I would still definitely stay here again.	
Aug 21 2009 	Great Stay	Got a great $85 deal on Priceline - you can't beat that. The location is great where Market meets California. The lobby is awesome. Fantastic 70's futuristic architecture. The rooms are comfortable, with windows that OPEN. Check in and valet were friendly and efficient. Would definitely stay here again.	
Aug 21 2009 	A couple of positives a couple of negatives	I've stayed at the Hyatt Regency San Francisco several times and I always come away vaguely irritated. The hotel itself is fantastically situated across from the Ferry Building, with great Bay views. It's a monstrous, cavernous conference hotel. Many of the rooms have balconies which are equipped with two chairs and a little table. I recommend a deluxe King - ask for a room &quot;further out - closer to the Embarcadero.&quot; Buildings have been built next to the hotel which can obstruct some views. The rooms are on the small side, though recently renovated and have nice big sliders. Definitely pay extra for the concierge lounge here. In my opinion, it's one of the best. Situated in what was once a revolving lounge, you have fantastic views and great food, with equally nice service. They finished the renovation of this area last year and it's my primary reason for staying here. Now the negatives. The front desk staff aren't very warm or helpful, the valet takes an infuriating 45 minutes to bring the car around. (Plus it's an outrageous $50 a night) (not once - every time including my visit here a week ago and I remember the same thing from a year ago). Room service is beyond slow (over 45 minutes when the hotel is not busy) and the quality of the food is not good. (eggs benedict yesterday morning arrived cold, one egg ruptured and the hollandaise sauce solidified in the little pitcher and not pourable. The night before a cheeseburger was very odd - it seemed like the meat had that soy filler in it that reminded me of my junior high lunchroom). Another little negative - my minibar wasn't serviced at all during my stay: no diet coke/pepsi. All in all, the positives equal the negatives and leave me straddling the middle on this one. I'm a sucker for the view and being able to sit outside, so it gets a slight nod.	
Aug 18 2009 	Decent and convenient hotel	My husband and I chose this hotel, due to the name brand, price, and location (my husband wanted to stay within the financial district). We were not disappointed. Overall: The hotel is clean, comfortable, and well laid out. The hotel room itself was clean and the beds are very plush. I slept quite well. In addition, we had a partial view of the Bay bridge and the pier. The hotel staff (especially the concierge) was helpful and friendly. In addition, it has a BART station located right next to it and a MUNI cable car stop (that takes you to Fisherman's Wharf) across the street from it. Location: can't be beat, unless you stay in Fisherman's Wharf. However, we did not rent a car and was glad we didn't because parking is expensive in San Francisco. But with everything being so close (either a decent walk or short train ride away), we didn't miss the rental car anyways. To boot, arriving from and leaving to the airport was a breeze, with the BART station so nearby.Cons: The beds are plush. For me, this was wonderful. However, if you like a firm bed, this might be a problem for you. Also, the bathroom is small. In particular, the toilet is quite small. Again, I didn't have any issues with this either, but my husband did. And lastly, the location. It is located within the financial district. Therefore, it is not quite in the middle of things. While my husband and I have no issues with walking (apprx 45mins) and/or taking public transportation (apprx 15mins), if you do, this might be an issue. Just be warned.	
Aug 18 2009 	Wonderful Location	We were very happy with our choice of Hotels. It is in a great location, F Trains, Cable Cars, Ferry Market all right outside the doors. We even walked to Fisherman's Wharf, it's a bit of a walk but the weather was perfect for it. The Concierge recommended the Oriental Pearl in China Town...yummy. We would absolutely stay here again.	
Aug 16 2009 	Loved it - Perfect Location and Great Value	We stayed here on a Friday night - they offer a Friday night value - includes valet parking (normally $50!)- My room got upgraded to the TOP floor, I paid only $149 night for the Friday night special - the room is normally on the 2nd floor but smiling and making conversation (and being nice in general) helped get me upgraded. They have a Regency Club on the top floor for a $75 upgrade - Our friends allowed us to go up with them. The views are amazing! The food was abundant to the point it ruined my dinner at the restaurant we went to. They even have massage chairs in the Regency Club. I really enjoyed waking up and being so close the the ever amazing SF Farmer's Market. We spent the entire morning and afternoon across the street while our car was still parked at the Hyatt - your car is good there for 24 hours from the time you check in.We also had friends get a room from Hotwire the day they stayed for $120!! and there is some street parking across the street from the hotel on weekends! The view from our 17th floor was amazing to say the least- the bed was very comfortable, the room was clean, the bathroom was upgraded (like the entire roomWe even got a free $10 appetizer when we checked in at the Eclipse bar in the Atrium. We had to go tot he bar to get a drink as table service was lacking. The drinks were not bad priced either - I had a Ketel One Vodka Martini for $6! good valueAnother note - one side of the hotel has balconies and the other side has the street view (with the Bay Bridge) On the street side on a Saturday morning, you may be awakened by a street band trumpet or flute- we heard it at 9am and it continued until 11am+Easy check out too - the valet parking guys can be a bit nicer - they insisted that my parking was not paid for - I think because not many people know about the rate that I had that includes parking - such a deal!	
Aug 13 2009 	Farmers' Market Cable Car Central Location!	As someone completely obsessed with food, this hotel was a dream come true. Steps from the Ferry Building and the Ferry Plaza Farmers' Market, the Hyatt Regency SF is in an EXCELLENT location. If you are remotely interested in food, PLAN YOUR TRIP AROUND the Saturday Farmers' Market. It is unlike anything I've ever seen! The Ferry Building is amazing too-- a virtual mecca to food.Also, avoid the lines of people waiting for the Powell cable car lines and instead jump on the (supposedly less picturesque, but still awesome!) almost-empty California line RIGHT IN FRONT of the hotel! It goes up California into Nob Hill and you can avoid the crowds and spend your extra time eating and shopping more!The MUNI and BART are outside your doorstep. Buy a $24 7 day MUNI pass (also available for 1 day and 3 days) and hop on and off buses, streetcars, cable cars, and subways at your leisure. This was one of the best decisions we made on our trip.The room was nicely appointed, with crisp white linens on the bed and colorful accent pillows. Housekeeping does a very nice job and brought us anything we needed at a moment's notice. Fridges are available for $15/stay. There is a wireless and wired internet connection available-- but it is not free. This is one of the only drawbacks of this hotel. One of the other drawbacks is the noise that came through the connecting door in our room from the adjoining room (not people we knew-- two different families throughout the four nights who talked VERY loudly). We were so dead tired it didn't keep us from sleeping, but I'm sure a call to the front desk would have rectified the situation.The fitness center has great machines (ellipticals, treadmills, bikes), free weights, and some benches, and it felt great to be able to get a workout in before some marathon eating. The lobby is really cool. It is a HUGE hotel, so you wouldn't expect prompt and personalized service-- but they manage to accomplish just that. Everyone at the front desk, everyone on the phone, and everyone who came up to the room was polite, helpful, and prompt. As two women in our 20s, we never felt unsafe.This is not a luxury hotel, but it is a BIG step above basic. I would highly, highly, highly recommend it as the base for a trip to San Francisco for leisure and business travelers alike.	
Aug 9 2009 	You have to stay on the Regency Floor!	Great place, great location, cable is right out front, F line trolley is out the back entrance. You can walk to the Ferry building any many other sights. It is a must to stay on the Regency floors. This allow private access to the Regency Club on the 18th floor where there are many amenties, massage chairs, computers and food. They have a wonderful continental breakfast that has everything you need as well as snacks and drinks available all day. The happy hour was fantastic, cheeses, roasted veggies, appetizers drinks and an honor bar. After going there, we did not need dinner. The view from there is amazing. Parking is $57 so we parked at a lot (Embarcadero 3 or 4 ) that was less than a block away for $32 without in and out privileges, but that is not needed if you use the cable cars, etc. Get the $11 Muni pass which allows unlimited use of cable cars and other public transportation for the day.	
Aug 8 2009 	Pleasant stay	Large room. Great location next to waterfront and Ferry building . Right on F Line streetcar and BART and cable car (California street). Good service. Expensive parking	
Aug 7 2009 	Great location but hotels needs some work	Location can't be beat for everything to do in San Francisco, cleanliness has some issues in the bathrooms and hallways and fake dusty plants on each balcony need to be removed. Having two elevators for the top 3 floors and 3 for the other 14 floors is a real problem in a full house like we experienced. Other than that the property is very nice but is overpriced in both the rooms and especially the bar.	
Aug 7 2009 	Great Place To Stay	Location of hotel was perfect, very clean and the staff were all very friendly. We did request a room with city/bay view well worth the upgrade.The only downside to this hotel was the 5 elevators. On several occasions we had to wait 5min. or longer for an elevator. You are not able to use the stairs (only to be used during an emergency). City transportation was all within walking distance. If you are up for the walk to the warf it's approx. 20min. We used the Muni alot only $2 round trip and ticket is good for approx. 6hrs. Trolleys were $5 one way, we did not ride the trolleys, but the start or end is right out the front door of the hotel. Cabs are reasonable as well, and usually parked in front of hotel.Would stay here again.	
Jul 30 2009 	Convenient place to stay for SF Marathon	We chose to stay in this hotel due to its proximity to the start/finish line for the 2009 SF Marathon. It wasn't cheap but was well worth the price since the event was just across the street. Parking, on the other hand, caught us by surprise. Using the Hotel Valet to park your car will add another $57 to your bill or you can go one block down and pay $32 for self-parking. The valet understands that this will probably seem excessive to some people and appropriately informed us of our options/price before leaving the car with him. The front desk check-in process was efficient, cordial but lacked any personal touches. It wasn't bad but it probably would have done the hotel credit to make guest feel a bit more welcomed. The room was better than expected. Comfortable bed. LCD TV. In a standard 2nd floor room facing market street, the bedroom was somewhat separated from the bath and entry foyer. Although the Bay view rooms are more expensive and I usually prefer higher floors, the 2nd floor overlooking the main street was very nice. Although it didn't have a balcony, sliding doors opened nicely allowing fresh air and the city atmosphere to enter the room. Overall, it was a pleasant stay and served its purpose nicely.	
Jul 28 2009	Great Location near Ferry Building with lots of amenities at a reasonable price	We stayed 2 nights @ the Hyatt Regency SF and wish we could have stayed longer. The hotel was lovely. The location was convenient. Right across the street from the Muni (local train) and BART (regional train) especially if you fly into the SFO airport. You can get on the BART and arrived across the street from the Hyatt Regency in about 30 minutes. The California cable car originates in front of the Hyatt. The Ferry Building is one block away. Here you can get the tram or bus. A perfect location if you plan on using the public transportation system which takes you where ever you want to go. Fisherman's Warf is a short ride away. The rooms were spacious and clean. The beds were very comfortable. There were lots of pillows, towels etc. The bathroom was large and clean with nice amenities. There was a mini bar (cost) and flat screen TV. This hotel has a lot of amenities including valet parking and a Budget rental car location on sight which was very convenient for us. The staff was efficient and helpful, the concierge knowledgable and check in quick. And the price was very reasonable. We paid around $140 a night plus tax on Orbitz. which is about what we would have paid for a much lesser hotel in the same location. I'd love to stay here again when I come to San Francisco.	
Jul 25 2009 	Okay. Nice Hotel small bathrooms EXPENSIVE parking	The hotel looks very nice. Very spacious and modern decor in the lobby area. Upon check-in, there seemed to be a shortage of rooms, so we had to wait awhile -- but not too long.The hotel parking is sooooo expensive! Make sure you budget that in before you book. It was $57.00 per night. When you have kids and luggage, you really don't want to walk the block or so from the cheaper parking building down the way for $32.00 per day.We were two adults and two children. With this, keep in mind that the beds are double beds and not queens. They were a little cramped for all of us. The bathroom area is way, way too small. You literally have to squeeze into the toilet/shower area before you can close the door. And, if you have the bathtub towel on the floor -- forget it. You have to move it out of the way first.The location is good, but I do think I would try another hotel first. Like I said, the price was extreme, rooms small, parking price insane.	
Jul 21 2009 	We Have Been Changed for Good - 'Wicked Weekend'	A weekend trip to the City to see 'Wicked' was enhanced by a terrific stay at the Hyatt Regency. The rooms were clean and comfortable (great bed!), Registration smooth and helpful, the view - Spectacular. We used public transit. Oakland Airport on BART stopped 50' from the entrance to the hotel. Access to Fisherman's Wharf, the Orpheum, shopping, . . . was a single 'ride' away. Complaints? I'm stumped.	
Jul 18 2009 	Great Hotel for the Money!	We did a wine country tour then stayed 2 nights in SF. We found this on Priceline.com for about $100/night with taxes/fees (name your own price). The hotel was in a great location, the historic trolley stops right next to it, the port is across the street. The lobby is huge with some 60 foot tall artwork, the exposed hallways are stacked up, so you can look down into the lobby. There is also a bar resturant in the lobby, had a late night burger there and it was very good. The room was spacious and clean, they were a little skimpy on the towels. It was a separate sink setup with the toilet/tub in it's own room. Which was nice when getting ready. Our tv remote didn't work, it was replaced quickly.Valet parking is $55 a night, we parked in a garage around the corner for about $35/night, and left the car there for 2 days. One thing that is frustrating is there is only 1 elevator bank, and it was at the opposite send of the hall where our room was.Priceline rated this 4 stars......I would say more like 3 to 3.5. It was a Hyatt, so we got what was expected a nice clean, quiet room, with a standard of service that made the stay pleasant. I would stay there again for up to $150/night.	
Jul 18 2009 	Nice Hotel no problem	I am actually a Hyatt employee who stayed at this hotel and the rooms were a lot more impressive than at the property I work at (can't disclose that). I would avoid the $$expensive$$ in-house dining, even with my 50% discount, breakfast still came to something like $25 after a tip, etc. There's lots of places to eat around this city, check them out. Of course the location is good, the LCD tv is a plus, and I won't even complain about the lack-of-Free WiFi, didn't surprise me at all. I also really liked how this place is convenient to the cable cars and BART. I would recommend this to anyone willing to spend the extra $$$.	
Jul 14 2009 	Great location easy distance to everything.	This Hyatt is right in the heart of the financial district. It sits right next to a BART station for easy access to SFO and all points BART serves. It is also close to the Muni lines and cable cars. The tracks can be busy at times, but all public transportation is in San Fran. Fisherman's Wharf is only 10 minutes by cable. Union Square is only 5. Five minutes to At &amp; T Park for the Giants games.  We actually bid our own price on Priceline for this hotel and only paid $75 a night. It is ranked as a 3 1/2 star hotel in their book. I would say that is accurate. The lobby is an impressive atrium. The hotel looks like has been recently refurbished. It does not have that &quot;old hotel&quot; feel, even though it has been there a while. We had our room on the &quot;city view&quot; side, even though we were offered the &quot;bay view&quot; side for an extra $40 a night. I would say that they are the exact same view. Save your 40 bucks, as this is not sitting directly on the bay anyway. The city can be noisy in the mornings when the financial district starts up. It is noticeable, but not overwhelming. We did have some crazy homeless guy yelling one morning at 5 am for 2 hours that drove us nuts, and we were on the 5th floor. I assume someone told him to shut it, or killed him, because it suddenly stopped. The good thing is that the financial district does calm down considerably after business hours. Our room was spacious and had a king size bed that was comfortable for a hotel bed. I desk with computer plugs. (Pricey internet, bring your own modem). I would like to see a small fridge in the room as this only has a computerized mini bar in it. You can have one brought up for a per day fee. This should be a gimme in rooms these days I feel. As well as a microwave. They are cheap nowadays, and could be utilized for snacks and restaurant leftovers. The bathrooms were amply sized and, important to me; had clean tile. (pet peeve of mine ;)..) Another thing this hotel lacks is a swimming pool/ hot tub. A swim and soak would be the perfect end to a day spent walking and riding on public transportation. The staff was very attentive to the requests we had. Very friendly and professional. I would say this is the perfect hotel at the Priceline price, but not at the rate that they get -over 120 bucks; and definitely not over $200. I would however, stay here again.	
Jul 12 2009 	Needs a facelift!	Great hotel staff! But the hotel does need a facelift. The bathroom is outdated and the carpet is old.If you drive, the over night self parking is $32 or $80 for valid parking.I will stay somewhere else next time.	
Jul 8 2009 	Great location!	Stayed here for one week in February and enjoyed my stay immensely although it is somewhat on the pricey side. The location is prime. I enjoy walking so this place was perfect for me as I was able to see a fabulous part of the city on foot. Their fitness center is also top notch. The service was also excellent. Too bad they don't have a pool. Will definitely stay here again.	
Jul 2 2009 	Loved the Regency Club and the building	We recently spent 5 nights at the Hyatt Regency San Francisco and would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to stay in the city centre and use public transport.We arrived by Amtrak, on their shuttle bus from Emeryville which dropped us at the Ferry Building. We headed over the road, luggage in tow, but had difficulty finding the entrance to the hotel. There are several doors visible on the Ferry Building side of the hotel but they are all 'exit only'. We had to walk right around to the other side of the hotel, to the entrance on Drumm Street.But after this not so good start, we were greeted well at reception. I had requested some degree of water view (despite having only been able to book a city view) but the room pre-allocated was apparently at the city end of the hotel. However, the gentleman checking us in very kindly moved us to a room with a view of the water. Our room was a Regency Club King on the 17th floor, with an angled view of the Bay Bridge. The room was a decent size (although an odd, angled shape), well appointed and comfortable, fairly newly renovated I would guess, but some things seemed to have been designed for design's sake and didn't quite work from a practical point of view. There wasn't much storage space  much of the floor space in closet was taken up with the safe and left very little space for storing luggage. The enclosed part of the bathroom had the toilet and a large walk-in shower, but there was nowhere to hang towels except over the shower enclosure door. The TV set into the bathroom mirror is an interesting gimmick, but really just a novelty. The toiletries provided were 'white ginger' or some such, which I didn't find at all pleasant  the smell reminded me of public toilets, which isn't a particularly attractive perfume! I missed the lavender-citrus products Hyatt used to provide.I did find the chaise longue comfortable, and my husband appreciated the large flat screen TV which could be angled to wherever you wanted to sit. And I greatly enjoyed the view, being able to watch ships in the bay and the historic streetcars running along Market Street and around onto the Embarcadero.The Regency Club was excellent and we made more use of it than we'd thought we would. We were surprised, however, to find that it closes at 9pm. We had been given a card at check-in to show the times when, variously, breakfast, snacks, drinks and dessert are available. But when it said dessert 8pm-9pm, we didn't realise the Club would then close at 9pm. Breakfast had a good selection of fruit, a couple of different danish or muffins each day, cereals, and bread and bagels to toast. The snacks during the day were just apples/oranges and cookies, plus 2 or 3 kinds of trail mix or mixed nuts. In the evening there was a different hot item, eg chicken wings. Then dessert was 2 different kinds of cake, which varied, plus small chocolate brownies. There were coffee machines and a juice machine (orange, apple and cranberry, I think) always available, and fridge stocked with cans of soda and bottles of water), to help yourself any time the club was open. I'm not sure that the honor bar system works  my husband enjoyed a beer most evenings and duly completed the slip to say what he'd had and put it in the box. But although we often saw other people taking alcoholic drinks or with drinks at their tables, we never saw anyone else complete an honor bar slip. We thought the honor bar prices were pretty good, certainly cheaper than the mini-bar in the room.There were 2 PCs available which we found useful, although often other guests ignored the signs asking people to limit their use to 30 minutes to allow others access.At the desk there was always a form where they asked people to sign into the Club, but very few people seemed to do this. Access to the Club was not well controlled. There was never a member of staff at the desk, only those who were replenishing the food at times when it was available. Although supposedly you can only access it from certain elevators, with an authorised room key, several times we saw people who had found their way up there and were having a look around, and from their conversation they did not appear to be RC guests. Only once did I hear a member of staff challenge a group as they entered and ask them to leave. Another time someone asked a member of staff how much the food and drink cost, and when it turned out they were not RC guests, their group was asked to leave.The hotel is very handy for public transport, which is excellent in this city. There's a BART station right outside the hotel, on Market Street, as is the terminus of the California Street cable car. Stops for the streetcars and trolleys are also very close. The nearest place to buy a multi-day MUNI passport is over in the Ferry Building. As others have reported, the parking charge at the hotel is daylight robbery! $57.00 per day, including tax. However, we did know about this when we booked. Aside from the cost, we found having to use the valet parking inconvenient and a little restrictive.We enjoyed looking at the architecture of the hotel, inside and out. It is certainly an interesting building. And if you've seen the movie 'Towering Inferno', the elevators may look very familiar  except they're actually inside, not outside as in the movie. We found all the staff to be friendly and helpful (well, except for the lady at the Budget car rental desk who was singularly unhelpful, but she was not a hotel employee).We are glad we chose to stay at the Hyatt, we liked the location and we particularly enjoyed the Regency Club. However, when we visit San Francisco again I think we'll stay a little further out where we don't have to pay for parking and can have immediate access to our car.	
Jul 2 2009 	Impressive looking hotel ... not sure about its location though	This hotel is impressive looking on the outside and on the inside with a.lovely modern reception area and lobby which is reminicent of the burj al arab in dubai! The hotel rooms are large and the beds are very comfortable and the bathroom area was very spacious and clean - we also had a view of the bay from our hotel room. However do bear in mind that this hotel DOES NOT have a view of the golden gate bridge as it is located near to the Bay Bridge and therefore is some distance away from the golden gate bridge itself..... so if you are paying extra for a bay view it may not be worth it. It is also a fair distance from Pier 39 and other attractions are a long walk or a taxi ride away. The Hotel is located in the financial district where there is not much going on and for this reason I would choose a hotel closer to all of the action next time, although saying that ... it is next to the ferry building where there is a local market and the BART station is located very close to the hotel which is useful for getting to and from the airport. However another issue was the service that we received by the reception staff who were un willing to help us with simple questions when the concierge was not present and also the guys responsible for holding our bags were rude and snatched the tip from my friends hand before thay had a chance to give it to them! In addition it lacked the overall service that you get in some hotels such as opening doors and welcoming guests etc..... so overall it looked lovely and was very comfortable but lacked customer service and the location is questionable.	
Jul 1 2009 	Perfect Location	Being from the bay area, its fun to play tourist in our backyard. The Hyatt Regency is right along the water at the Embarcadero and its location can't be beat. Upon check-in, it's customary for us to ask for the best room possible. Boy, did we get lucky. Our room was surprisingly very spacious with a gorgeous view of the bay. As far as amenities, bedding, comfort, etc... it definitely ives up to its 4-star rating. The breakfast buffet is fresh &amp; delicious with great service. The Ferry Building is across the street. Go there and try the coffee at &quot;Blue Bottle&quot;, it's the best coffee ever. If you're a bread fanatic stop at Acme for the best bread in town. Also, don't miss out on the farmers market on Sat. You can walk to Chinatown (10 min), Union Square (15 min), as for public transportaion, muni, BART and the cable cars are right outside the hotel doors. Cabs are plentiful and easy to come by.	
Jun 29 2009 	Hyatt-Regency San Fran - World Class	Large spacious comfortable rooms, elegant public space/lobby, spectacular design, great views of the Bay, courteous staff. Walking distance to Fisherman's Wharf and other attractions. Everything one would expect from a Hyatt and more. Highly recommended.	
Jun 15 2009 	Convenient and Comfortable Hotel	I recently stayed at the Hyatt Regency for business and found this hotel very comfortable. It was quiet and clean. I have to agree that it is probably time for some freshing up but overall a nice hotel. It is convenient to public transportation (the California Cable Car turnaround and BART is right outside the door.) They have a good happy hour with most drinks and house wine costing $5. There are plenty of restaurants around it with limited hours. The area caters to lunch time visitors since it is in the financial district. I would recommend this hotel for a San Francisco visit.	
Jun 3 2009 	Dated and Tired - needs an Update	This hotel, although well located near Union Square, is in dire need of a facelift in the common areas as well as the rooms. Tired decor. Amenities are weak, especially for a diamond member.	
Jun 3 2009 	Great Views	I needed a hotel for a few days to relax and explore San Fransisco. I had no particular agenda in mind.I found the Hyatt Regency to be very well located. The rooms had a wonderful sit-out overlooking the piers and the water - stunning views!Rooms were well appointed and very comfortable, and the hotel offered fairly good food in both room service and the restaurants.Unless you want to be close to the shopping action, this hotel is very well located.	
Jun 2 2009 	Average hotel great location	My husband and I went to SF for a quick getaway weekend. We stayed at the hyatt because we had free nights there. The hotel location is great because it is right next to the Embarcadero building, downtown, and walking distance to North Beach, Chinatown, Soma, and Union Square. There are a lot of bus routes/bart in the vicinity to get to any other part of town. The hotel itself was average. The check in process was smooth. But I was surprised there was no offer to take up our bag to the room. The hotel lobby is nice but dark. I would recommend adding more lights to give it a little more liveliness. The room was on the 15th floor with a partial view of the bay and the rest of the view was of the buildings in the area. The bay view is incredible. The room itself was nicely furnished. However, there were a few details that needed attention. The carpet seemed a little dirty. Overall, I would give this hotel a 3.8 stars.	
May 27 2009 	Great location good room	The Hyatt Regency is centrally located just across from a BART station and the Ferry Building, and near major shopping areas and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. It is of the standard Hyatt format of rooms surrounding a large atrium. We had a nice king room with a view of the Ferry Building. The bed was comfortable, bathroom was OK, but it had a mediocre bathtub/shower for a luxury hotel. The room had a large LCD/HD television, good desk, and comfortable lounge chair. Internet costs $10 per night and is somewhat slow. Many rooms are a long walk from the elevator cluster, so ask for a room near the elevator if you have mobility problems. An excellent hotel.	
May 24 2009 	Nice visit in SF	Check in is at 3pm but we arrived at 10 am on a Saturday and they were able to check us in 5 hours early. We got a n/s room, king bed, with a beautiful view of the Bay Bridge and the Ferry Building. Open the sliding doors and you get the sound of jazz music and the hustle and bustle of the city, but once the doors closed it was completely silent. The room was very clean and the service at the front desk was excellent. Our plans included the Ferry Building, Fisherman's Wharf, Union Square and North Beach so if you don't mind walking or catching the public transport, then this is a great hotel to stay at. We self-parked at Four Embarcadero (at Clay St) and it was simple to pull our luggage over the walkway, up the escalator to the lobby. If you have lots of luggage, or children then I can see how it could be somewhat of a hassle, but for us it was quite simple and worth the savings. The cost for 1 day on the weekend was $35. I would definitely stay here again.	
May 23 2009 	Find someplace else	1. No pool so don't bring your kids.2. They charge an additional 10 bucks for wireless.3. Valet parking is 57 bucks.4. Self-park is two blocks away and its 32 bucks so what's the savings?.5. Don't bring your bikes. Drive into the self-park building: the entrance is 12 feet high and the sign that says &quot;6 foot clearance&quot; is invisible. Until you hit the 6 foot ceiling and it rips your bikes and rack off your car.	
May 13 2009 	Great Hotel in Perfect Location	My wife and I stayed at the Hyatt Regency last Saturday, 5/09 for just a night. We stayed in the balcony suite. The suite was very clean and the view from the balcony was amazing. The location was great, the bed was extremely comfortable , they had an additional mini fridge to store food and drinks besides the minibar and the service in the hotel was great. We were able to check in and out without any problems. We did not pay the parking fee of $50 dollars at the hotel because there are alot of other parking garages within a few blocks of the hotel that are alot cheaper. I would definitely recommend this hotel (especially room#1456) to others who are looking to stay in S.F. It was well worth the price of the room.	
May 10 2009 	Good Hotel but DONT do Regency Club for Holiday (only really good for business)	We stayed for 5 nights in the Regency Club level. Hotel was clean and modern with good service. Concierge were fantastic and really helpful when trying to find great places to eat - they gave great advice. Hotel food was nice, especially the lunch. The regency club rooms were smaller than expected and bathroom was a little disappointing. I would advise definately NOT to do the regency club unless you're on business as there is a smaller choice of breakfast than in the normal hotel, happy hour drinks aren't free (as they are in some hyatt regency's) and for the money you pay to upgrade it's really not worth it, but having said that the circular top floor bar area only accessible by regency club people is lovely! We found the hotel a bit &quot;hit and miss&quot; but only because we upgraded to regency club. Otherwise i'd reccommend it.	
May 3 2009 	Hyatt does it again	What a nice hotel! I had a spacious and beautiful room with a view of the bay bridge and the ferry terminal. Comfortable furniture and bed and and ipod dock. Convenient to the embacadero and bart. I'll stay here the next time i'm in san francisco, for sure.	
May 3 2009 	Fantastic Hotel	Stayed for 4 nights. Rooms are very well appointed, Good large beds, spacious, good views, good toilette, large LCD screen, and overall outstanding service. All you can expect from a Hyatt property in a big city. The lobby was very large, service was attentive and corteuous, and the price I paid for the room (picked on the web a day before checking in) was $99.00 + tax which is a great bargain.The location is excellent for business and shopping/ sightseeing. There are no faults for this hotel except for the following:Internet: extremely poor. The wireless connection in my room (and I heard in many others too) stopped working at some point, and stopped and start constantly during my 4 night stay. The signal quality was very low. They charged 9.95 per day for this on top of it. I complained about it and took off the charges off my bill. However, it was very frustrating at times not being able to log on. This property must fix this because for a business in hotel it is simply inexcusable. It is so simple to fix I don't understand why they have not.Carparking: the cost was $57 per day and that is prohibitive and difficult to justify as a guest to a hotel. If you don't mind either, stay at the Hyatt. If you care about the internet ring the Hyatt beforehand and check out whether this has been fixed.	
Apr 29 2009 	Probably the best choice in SF.	Hyatt feels. Great location and value for money. Ask for the room near the corner, great sea views and bridge views over the large window.	
Apr 21 2009 	Great location Ok to good hotel	HOTEL REVIEW # 172 Hyatt EmbarcaderoMY TRAVEL STYLE: If possible, I try to stay away from business hotels and strongly prefer resorts that resemble the Four Seasons, Aman, and Oberoi but try to find similar properties at lower cost. I seek out the wow experiences and I encourage you to view hotels I have stayed at and their respective reviews (by clicking on my name).LOCATION: Excellent. More quiet than Union Square and just 20 minute walk or 5 minute cab ride away. The farmers market is across the street with some nice options for meals. Pier 39 is about a 25 minute walk from the hotel. TYPE OF ROOM: Concierge level; upgraded room.BED/SHEETS/PILLOW: Very good but not dreamy. Sheets are of good enough quality but they could have been better. Pillows are very nice down.LIGHTING: Room is a bit dark even with all of the lights on and the bathroom is better.BATHROOM/SHOWER: Shower door doesnt close well, water pressure is medium with consistently hot water pressure. Mirror in bathroom has a TV in it that blocks most of the mirror for shorter people. The fan in the bathroom will not turn off and its a bit loud.TOILETRIES: Nice, may be worthy of taking home.CLEANLINESS: Room is clean.A/C: Quickly gets the room cool, but its definitely louder than average.CLOSET SPACE: More than average and two people may be able to pack most items.STYLE OF ROOM: Newly renovated room still looks like it could use an upgrade. Some of the décor are peeling off, the TV is out of place and the ceilings are low. Also, the view is somewhat blocked by the concrete on the outside of the building.COMMON AREA: Not impressive. Looks like an Embassy Suites from the 70s. Fake plants line each level. The tiled flooring is old and the carpeting in the hallways are some of the ugliest I have seen in a hotel.QUIET/MORNING LIGHT: Room was quiet but the A/C and the bathroom fan were a bit too loud. Also the mini-bar was beeping all night and kept me awake until I unplugged it.FOOD: Room service Caesar salad was ok and a drink at the bar was not good.. TV/INTERNET: Many channels on the flatscreen TV which is a very nice size for the room. Didnt use the internet but it is available at a charge.SERVICE: Staff was not impressive as many requests were not delivered and a few issues went unresolved.SUMMARY: The location is very good but just across the street is a much better hotel, Vitale. I would suggest staying there. The best feature of this hotel is the nice view of the water the the concierge level has an outstanding view of the bay bridge and water which makes for an excellent place to hang out after a long day of walking. I still think the best hotel is the St Regis. If you are looking for nightlife, I would suggest staying at the Hotel Monaco or in that area. Shopping is best at Union Square (which is also walking distance from Monaco area). There are definite better hotels to stay at so I wouldnt recommend this one unless the price is right.	
Apr 16 2009 	Almost perfect	We just returned after enjoying six nights in San Francisco. We chose the Hyatt Regency due to its location and overall reputation. We were not disappointed. We were given a city view room with two double beds (would have loved a bay view room but they seemed to only be available in king bed rooms and we are a family of four). The room was spacious, smelled good, and was very clean except for the carpeting which looks old and slightly dirty (not that bad, just old). The hotel is over 35 years old and looking its age in places but it seemed generally well maintained. Our children were in awe of the lobby and glass elevators. Housekeeping did an amazing job each day, leaving us extra towels, glasses, etc. We loved the proximity to the Ferry Building and transit (California Street cable car is just steps away from the south west corner of the hotel). The area does have its share of homeless people, but we did not ever feel threatened or bothered. There are several shops across from the hotel which made it very convenient to buy things as we needed. The hotel staff are all very professional and friendly and ensured that we had a great stay. We did not eat at the Hyatt as we were on the go so much (and the Ferry Building across the street has amazing food shops). This was our first stay at a Hyatt property and we were very impressed. And we absolutely fell in love with San Francisco. We will return!	
Mar 26 2009 	Prime location and convenience in San Francisco	Stayed two nights, March 6 &amp; 7, 2009, at the Hyatt Regency San Francisco. Booked our reservation on the Hyatt website where I've always been able to find excellent Senior Discount rates. The hotel lobby is quite spectacular. We were efficiently checked into our room by a very pleasant young man at the front desk.Our room was 1212 and had one king size bed. The room itself was spacious overall. This particular room had been remodeled and was tastefully decorated. There was a large foyer upon entering the room. The bedroom area was layed out very well and included the standard work desk with an excellent work chair. There was also a comfortable lounge chair with ottoman. Another nice touch is that while we were there they installed new iHome clock radios that are made for use with iPods. The bed was extremely comfortable, too.There aren't balconies on the Market Street side of the hotel which is where this particular room is located. However, we had a great view of the bay, the Bay Bridge and the Embarcadero. The floor to ceiling windows do open like a sliding door. Only complaint about this room, and other Hyatts I've stayed in, is the bathroom. They are usually on the small side. This one had a wash basin with black granite counter outside the bath/toilet area. The actual room with the bath and toilet was cramped. Maintenance also needs to get in there are replace the caulking around the tub as it was mouldy. However, the room itself overall was kept clean.I do recommend a high floor room if you're on the Market street side. You can hear street noise although it is dampened with the window shut. Depending on whether you enjoy the theme song from the movie &quot;Love Story&quot; you may also enjoy, or not, the street performer who plays sax on the street below these rooms. He knows only one song and plays it faithfully. Fortunately, his lip gave out before we went to sleep. I wasn't a fan of his playing, sorry. You cannot beat this place for convenience. If you ride BART from the airport (SFO) it will take you about half an hour from the airport to the Montgomery Street station. You come up the stairs or escalator and the hotel is right there. BART and Muni both share all the stations downtown except on different levels. I prefer and recommend BART over Muni whenever possible. I believe the fare was $5.95 each way. A cab ride to downtown will probably run you close to $50, plus the traffic can be a nightmare during rush hour. Take BART, save money and aggravation! It's safe and easy.My partner and I took BART up to Civic Center Saturday evening to see the San Francisco Symphony, and it worked perfectly for us both ways. Just a word of advice if you are unfamiliar with the city. Follow the crowd on Grove Street from the BART station going to the symphony or opera, and stay with the crowd heading back to the BART station after the performance. There are a lot of people going back to BART after the perfomance, and this will prevent you from walking alone in this neighborhood at night. I lived in San Franscisco for five years so I know Civic Center is not an area visitors should walk around in at night by themselves. This advice would apply to opera, too, as the symphony hall and opera house are across the street from one another on Grove.I also recommend a restaurant called &quot;The Blue Muse&quot; which is on Grove street between Franklin and Gough. It is one block from either the symphony or opera house. This has always been my favorite restaurant in the Civic Center area. Prices are very reasonable and the food excellent. We had friendly and efficient service as we normally do there. Back to the hotel now. As others have said the location can't be beat. There is a Noah's Bagels on the ground floor Market Street side where we picked up coffee and food for breakfast. The entrance to Noah's is from Market street, not the hotel. There are also bakeries, a Walgreen's drug store, and liquor store directly across the street from the main hotel entrance. If you want to ride the cable car the California street line is right out the front door, too, as is a stop for the historic street cars which I think are fun. We didn't see a line all weekend for the cable car stop. However, it is not as exciting a route as the other cable car line, beginning at Market and Mason streets, as it basically just goes straight up California street. You could take it up the hill and transfer onto the Mason street line if you wanted to try the other route. This would keep you from waiting in the extremely long lines at the Market and Mason street stop.On Saturdays and Sundays there is a terrific artist bazaar along the Embarcadero side of the hotel during the day from about 10 a.m. until 4 p.m. Really unique and interesting stuff to browse. One of the artists told me they extend it to daily during summer tourist season. There is also a Farmer's market across the Embarcadero in front of the Ferry Building. The Ferry Building is also where you can catch a ferry to Sausalito which can be a fun day trip.All in all we were extremely pleased with our stay at the Hyatt Regency San Francisco. We've stayed at the Grand Hyatt on Union Square before, but we both liked this Hyatt hotel better. It was much more convenient for public transportation and it was a more impressive property overall. This will remain a first pick hotel for us on future trips to the city.	
Mar 23 2009 	Great location but smelly unclean and uncomfortable	We are just back from a four-night stay at this Hyatt. This was our first stay at a Hyatt in San Francisco. Almost all our previous trips were at the Stanford Court (Renaissance) up on the hill. We chose the Regency for it's location and based on a friend's suggestion. For location it is great. It is at the foot of California, where it meet's Market. It is right across the street from the Ferry Building, and right next to the Embarcadero BART/MUNI station. It offers great access to the central business district. The atrium is impressive (see picture - taken from 12th floor). The hotel is triangularly shaped with the hypotenuse slanting inward over the atrium. Rooms on the Hypotenuse offer a &quot;baby balcony&quot;. And all have at least a partial view of the Bay... looking out toward Treasure Island. One would think that a balcony would be great, that we could leave our door open and get a nice breeze in of the bay. One would be correct. However, there are a few problems with this notion, and they will force us to ask for a no-balcony room if we ever go there again.First... Pigeons. These rats with wings are as numerous as they are fearless. They will come into your room.Second... Smokers. These morons destroy other people's access to fresh air by using their balconies to smoke. The room was standard to a bit larger than I normally see. We had a single king bed and plenty of space. The TV is a flat screen and channel selection is large. The pillows were great, but the bed was hard and uncomfortable. The mattress would make a good adjunct to a seismograph as it was able to transmit the faintest of movements from one person to the other. While the hotel tried to disguise this effect through the use of a thick mattress cover, the beds are at least a generation behind what other higher level large hotels are using. Uncomfortable bed = bad sleep = diminished vacation. This is the single largest detriment to the &quot;value&quot; rating. I have to ding the Hyatt on cleanliness as well. It was pretty obvious that our non-smoking room had been previously occupied by a smoker. While we were able to air it out to the point of tolerability, it was still stuffy, stale and dank when we first arrived. We also discovered that our balcony was littered with cigarette butts, used matches and a soggy paper napkin stuck to the floor. The balcony remained unclean for our entire stay. Housekeeping did not replace used cups in our room, which was fine as that forced my wife up and out in the early morning for coffee at the Ferry Building, but still attention to detail.Be wary of advice the hotel provides. We asked where we could purchase a day pass for the MUNI on Saturday. We were told to visit the booth outside the hotel. Ahhh there is no booth outside the hotel. You have to go over to the Ferry Building and buy them from the tour booth (inside beside the main entrance $11 for one day, $18 for three days, $24 for five days). We heard people ask for advice on getting to the airport. The first response was always you can take one of these cars right here sir. Their posted sign on airport access and fares talks about taxis and airport buses/vans. Curiously, for a hotel less than 50 feet from a BART station, the concept of rapid public transportation to the airport is lost on them.The homeless in the area are plentiful, though on a worldwide scale they are more friendly and cleaner on average. The hotel area sees a high volume of transients as it is next to a park and is in the flat area of the city as opposed to up on the hills where carts are difficult to push.If you want to stay near the Ferry Building or if you smoke, this is your place. You are welcome to it. As for us, well be trying out the Union Square Hyatt next time unless we stay with our traditional favorite, the Stanford Court.	
Mar 17 2009 	Very Pleased	I booked the Hyatt for a business trip and stayed for two nights. The location is perfect, on Market in the financial district. The BART station is right in front of the hotel, which made getting from SFO cheap &amp; easy. The hotel has a grand central area and a very unique appearance. I stayed in a King room w/ a balcony, which was clean and spacious. It had great views of the bay and the city. The hotel has all the ammeneties of a larger chain hotel (gift shop, business center) as well as the convenience of a Walgreens and liquor store right across the street. The bar downstairs was busy and stayed open late. I am a smoker, but chose a non-smoking room and they provided me an ashtray to smoke on the balcony, which had a table and chairs for lounging. I would absolutely stay here again on my next trip. I was on the 10th floor and didn't hear any street noise, nor neighbors, doors slamming etc.	
Feb 22 2009 	Regency Club is like a 5 star Hotel with in a 4 star Hotel. Great Job Hyatt SF	I had 7 faster free nights that I needed to use before Feb. 28. So I took the Cal Train into the city and spent 9 nights at they Hyatt Regency. As a Hyatt Diamond Member I was upgraded to the Regency Club Level, Balcony Bay View, and I loved every second of it, was hard to leave. The Regency Club Rooms occupy the top 2 floors, and the club is on top of the hotel with an awesome views of the Bay Bridge, The Bay, and the Financial District. Each night the club had a wonderful spread of hous D'oenuvers, and in the morning a generous continental breakfast. The rooms have been renovated and are tastefully decorated with large plasma tv in the room, and a tv located in the bathroom mirror. The staff was friendly, accommodating, and professional. I would like to spend a special thanks to the housekeeping staff for the friendly 5 star service they provided. Every morning when I returned from breakfast my room was clean!!! Amazing it like they knew my schedule. I've stayed at almost every Hyatt, and one of my pet peaves is not having my room cleaned by 12 noon, and encountering a cold housekeeping staff. Thanks again Hyatt Regency San Francisco, you have the best Regency Club and Housekeeping Staff, it was an experience I will never forget.	
Feb 16 2009 	Disappointed with Quality	We booked 1 night for a family weekend overnight. The location of the hotel is the main attraction. We booked a room with view of the bay. The room was decent size, but everything about the room was out of date. Second, everything cost extra. Its ridiculous that hotels charge extra for internet these days. $10/day. Parking was $33/day for self park, and $55/day for valet.The hotel is probably fine for business or conventions, but there are much better choices in the city for a family or anyone wanting a weekend gateaway in the city.	
Feb 9 2009 	Nice getaway	A couple years ago before I had an apartment to myself I booked a room at the Hyatt for a getaway with my girlfriend. At that time I was able to get a room here for under $100/nt through Hotwire. The rooms are large and the beds are ultra-comfortable. The bathroom was also nice. I enjoyed staying at this hotel thoroughly. It is a good value if you can get a decent last-minute price.	
Jan 20 2009 	Great Weekend Tourist Experience	I booked this hotel on a very last minute trip to escape the cold weather and take advantage of sunny 70 degree weather in SF. I decided to go at 930am Friday 1/16 and was on a plane by 230pm. =). I bid for the hotel on Priceline, telling myself I would go if my $75 / night bid was accepted. Lo and behold, it was. Getting to the hotel from SFO via BART could not be easier - just exit at Embarcadero and the hotel is right in front of you. I arrived late - around 10pm. There was no wait and the service was friendly. They offered to upgrade me to a harborview room for $40+ / night. I politely declined, knowing I would rarely be in my room anyway. The clerk said no problem, and told me I'd get a nice room anyway. I didn't really believe him, but sure enough, my 12th floor room (1 king bed) had a great view of the port, Embarcadero Street and the SF / Oakland bridge. I found the room to be perfect - clean and comfortable (particularly the bed). There's a safe, iron, coffeemaker and minibar in the room. You could tell the room had be refurbished, as it was just a little nicer than the bathroom, where the tile and fixtures were just a bit dated (but still clean). Water was hot and pressure was fine. TV worked well and got plenty of channels. I did not use room service. As others have noted, the location is optimal. There's a 7-11. Walgreens and Starbucks right across the street, and a bagel store right around the corner. They were all open, even on weekends when the financial district is pretty quiet. For transportation, the BART / MUNI station is right at the hotel, as is the terminus for one of the cable car lines. Bus Route 1 stops 2 blocks away, making it easy to get to Chinatown and Nob Hill. The bus seems to run constantly with short waits to catch it. North Beach area is a quick 10 min walk. You can also easily catch the streetcar to Fisherman's Wharf or other places. I did a ton of walking, and the hotel is a great base camp for that. I did 15 miles on my first day's visit, going to Union Square, the Castro, through all of Golden Gate park, then along the Coastal Trail. When you get tired, it's easy to jump on public transportation and get right back to the hotel. Be sure to check out the Farmer's Market at the port across the street.When I needed a taxi at 430am to get to the airport, there were plenty available, along with a towncar service. Given the great price, awesome location and friendly service, I was very happy with the hotel and will definitely stay there again.	
Jan 6 2009 	Excellent location for sightseeing	We came here for my spouse's conference and got a $130 rate for two. Our room was excellent, with a partial bay view--probably because we are both Gold Passport members. I think the &quot;you get what you pay for&quot; comment from another reviewer is true; hotels also reward loyalty.The room was fine, on a low floor away from the elevator as per our\profiles. It had a small balcony which (if it were a bit warmer or drier) would be nice to sit on to see the bay and Embaracero area.The honor bar is touch-sensitive but I managed to slide some cheese in on top of the beer. (Note that if you do move something and are charged, if you have not consumed it, you CAN get them to take it off your bill!) The soap and lotion amenities are nice quality and scented with white ginger.Morning coffee is via a small coffeemaker in the room (ugh) or via a $2/cup honor bar in the atrium. That coffee is fine. Breakfast bufffet was perfectly OK but not extraordinary. You are across from the Ferry Building with its food markets, so with a little planning you can get food there to bring back for the morning or just go over there for breakfast.I was a tourist on this trip, so I found the location superb--on the flats for easy walking, close to ferries for scenic rides, a reasonable walk to Fishermans Wharf/Pier 39/the ballpark. It is right at the Embaracadero BART/Muni stop. You can be at Ocean Beach in under half an hour, or at Golden Gate Park. This definitely is my new favorite hotel in SF. And if you see the man with the gray cat on the sidewalk by the bagel place, please help them out!	
Dec 21 2008 	Weekend Getaway	We had tickets to a nearby show and decided to have dinner out before and stay over in the City. We booked a Bay View King (Room 1128) through the Hyatt website at a decent rate, Used the valet parking--very convenient but steep at $50 per day. The view was nice, though a lot of the view was of Embarcadero Center, rather than of the Bay itself. Very pleasant nonetheless. Big room with a desk and two sitting areas. Clean but smallish bathroom. The Atrium is decorated for the holidays, and the Ferry Building and holiday skating rink are adjacent.  Tip: The turnaround for the California Cable Car Line is just steps outside this hotel. While not as famous as the Powell Street Line, it's still a great ride and very often with little or no waiting.  We will probably make this stay again for the holidays or another special occasion.  Also, a note about booking rooms: I see many complaints posted on Tripadvisor from folks booking rooms at deep discounts and then complaining when they are offered one of the less desirable rooms at the hotel. Cliche but true: You get what you pay for.	
Dec 19 2008 	Unbelievable!	My husband and I stayed at the Hyatt Regency for one night last Saturday while we were in San Francisco for a conference.We booked a room at a discount price and the treatment we received at the Hyatt was very bad. They gave us the worst room of the hotel, very small, old, and very different from the other rooms of the hotel (I stayed there other times). For the price I paid, that room was horrible. The toilet was smaller than the closet in the room and very dark. Everything you touch you have to pay. Be careful when you stay there: if you just touch something from the minibar you will be immediately charged for it. And the price are expensive. Better visit the Walgreen in front of the hotel! I don't know if the next step will be charging you money for breathing in the room. Everything I paid was probably for the Christmas decorations in the hall. Terrible! I had better stay at motels!	
Dec 14 2008 	Great Experience	We stayed for two nights on our annual trip to the City for Christmas shopping &amp; activities. This was our first time at the Hyatt and were very happy with our stay. The staff was so friendly and everyone we met greeted us warmly or asked if they could help us with anything. We upgraded to the Regency Club which was a great bargain for us, considering what you receive. Bottled water, sodas, coffee (latte machine), teas and juices were available 24 hrs a day. Breakfast was a continental breakfast with cereal, fruit, bagels, muffins, etc. snacks of nuts &amp; cookies were put out mid-day. From 5-8pm they put out a self-service cocktail station where you can mix your own martinis or mixed drinks (beer &amp; wine are also available), and have a great spread such as cheeses, shrimp, crudites and ceviche. After 8pm they put out desserts.The Club itself is at the top floor and used to be a rotating restaurant. The view of the Bay Bridge and Treasure Island are fantastic. They have board games, massage chairs, computers/printers and binoculars you can use as well. Being we have a 4 yr old, we really enjoyed being able to utilize the Club. We were able to relax in a nice environment while entertaining her with a coloring book (provided by staff), some games we brought &amp; the binoculars. We didn't spend any money at the hotel (other than the crazy parking fee of $57 per night) and only went out to eat dinner one of the nights because we ate at the Club the first night (we usually end up spending on water, breakfast and desserts).On to the location..fantastic....We have never stayed in the Embarcadero area and were so pleased. The Ferry Building, which is directly across the street, has wonderful little foodie shops which reminded me of being in Paris were each shop specialized in one product. On the day we were leaving we went over and picked up some fresh bread, garlic infused olive oil, french pastries, cheeses and a bottle of wine to take home. It was Saturday so they also had a farmer's market 8am-2pm (I think). I couldn't believe I had never been to the Ferry Building in all my years of visiting the City. Between the hotel and the Ferry Building there is a plaza with numerous booths of items for sale such as art work, clothing, etc. I'm not sure, but it appeared they are set up everyday.Union Square is about a 15 minute walk (we were told) from the hotel. We decided to ride the BART ($1.50 for each leg), which again, I can't believe I have never used in all my years visiting. It was great. The Embarcadero entrance is right outside the hotel. We took rode to the Powell station which brings you in front of Westfield Shopping Centre. Union Square is about 2 easy blocks up from there. We then walked back down to the Powell station and rode up to the Civic Center stop. We walked from there (about 3 long blocks) to the Opera House for the Nutcracker performance. This area of the City is so beautiful with City Hall, the Opera House and the Symphony buildings being to ornate. The Nutcracker was such a beautiful experience as well.Another option for transportation is the cable car for which the end to the California Line is right out front. It goes up to Nob Hill. You can also get off at California &amp; Powell to go up to Fisherman's Wharf or the other direction to go to Union Square.As for restaurants, we went to Sinbad's which is right across the street next to the Ferry Building. We made this choice only because of the close location and the want for seafood. We would not return. The service was excellent, as was the view, but the food only fair for the price. Next time we would head to Pier 39 via streetcar. We weren't so interested in the hotel restaurant as it didn't offer much seafood.All in all, our only complaint is the parking fee. Other than that we really enjoyed our time here and will definitely return.	
Dec 2 2008 	Overall great hotel stay	I recently stayed at the Hyatt Regency in San Francisco for a four day conference. Overall, I really enjoyed my stay. The rooms came with small tubes of toothpaste which you business travels know is most helpful. The front desk staff was great as were the bartenders at the main bar. I love my room with a great view of the bay bridge and huge windows that slid open to make it feel like you were outside. The beds were comfortable and the rooms had a nice big flat screen tv. The location is pretty good. A $5 cab ride will take you to North Beach for great pubs and Italian food. Walking distance you will find a few good places at the Ferry Terminal as well as Osha Thai across from the ice skating rink. We walked to China Town for lunch and had wonderful Dim Sum at the Hang Ah Tea Room (kind of a back ally / dive kind of place with GREAT food). I took a cab from the airport to avoid parking costs. The gym was VERY crowded and far too small for a hotel of this size. If youre a 24 Hour Fitness member a great club is just a block away. Overall, I would stay here again.	
Nov 30 2008 	Highly Recommended Hotel at a Great Location	We stayed at this hotel for a few nights and had a very positive experience. The room and bathroom were very large and well-appointed with quality furnishings and products. I needed to purchase a souvenir from the hotel store and would have come back to the hotel late, well after the store closing, and the reception staff arranged to hold the item for me. I really appreciated this.The location of the hotel is very convenient as a base for exploring San Francisco. Should you have a rental car, be forewarned that the hotel and area parking options are quite pricey. There are some terrific restaurants in the area.	
Nov 30 2008 	Great hotel but excessive fees	Got a great rate via Hotwire for our family vacation to SF. The hotel is very nice - the Embarcadero is a convenient location with shopping, dining, and public transportation nearby. Hotel lobby/atrium is beautiful and has a very impressive Christmas display for the holidays.Housekeeping was great - very responsive when we needed extra towels, etc.The only negative is that the fees for additional services are somewhat excessive, IMHO. When we checked in, the clerk tried to upgrade us to a &quot;room with a balcony for only $40 more&quot; - when we declined, they tried to get us to join a $75 club to allow us exclusive access into some lounge at the hotel (or something like that). We were just tired and wanted to check in, but it felt like we were buying a used car!Valet parking is $50/night, self parking is $30 (try to get street/meter parking if you can!). There's a minibar in the room with typical exorbitant prices - and it's a computerized one that charges as soon as you remove the food/drink items. So you can't even remove some soda/beer temporarily to use the fridge for your own items. There was a note saying you could call to have the fridge emptied so you can use it - for just a $30 fee!Of course, high-speed internet access is $10/day, which is about average for a high end hotel.Anyway, if I was on business and expensing the parking and fees, I might not care but I thought the fees were a little excessive when paying out of your own pocket!	
Nov 30 2008 	Always a great place to stay in SF	My husband and I always stay at the Hyatt Regency Embarcadero whenever are in SF. The quality of the room and the great service is always consistent. We plan on staying here again next month when we visit our families for the holidays.	
Nov 23 2008 	Great location to the Wharf!!!!	Stayed at the Hyatt for a conference. Since they didn't have a room available for the last day of our stay, they upgraded us to a Deluxe Room which was very nice: great amenities, very clean, flat-screen TV, very comfortable bed. The staff was very helpful and super friendly. Have only one complaint - do not use their WiFi if you don't really have to: in the end it cost $10 more which they do not refund or add into the hotel charge - I hate adding new expenses to my travel reports - just add it into the rool charg.	
Nov 22 2008 	Book somewhere else	I was booked at this hotel for a conference, so I didn't choose it, and I have to say this is one of the worst hotels I've ever stayed at in my life. It is the noisiest hotel because all the rooms span off the main foyer where music and events echo throughout the whole hotel and because my room also faced the road the noise from traffic, the buskers and the doormen's whistles is was pretty unbearable. It is also a complete rip-off but because there isn't much to choose from for food in the area except for the day cafes, even on a Saturday night I couldn't find an open pizza restaurant in a 2 mile radius at 7pm. Everything in the hotel is extra cost, for example, to have room service add an additional 20% on top and a $5 gratuity.	
Nov 18 2008 	Give it a pass if you're seeking luxury	My wife and I (mid-twenties) stayed in this hotel on a Saturday night for a romantic getaway in the city.While the location of the hotel is good, the hotel itself feels jaded. The bathroom is small, and the room is not extra-ordinary. The hotel lobby is alright, but at various places, the walls are not painted, and the hotel gives an unfinished / not-well-maintained look.We were really hoping for a luxurious stay (given our experience at some other Hyatt Regency hotels), but were quite disappointed in the end. We live in the bay area and love the city and plan more getaways, but Hyatt Regency Embarcadero is certainly off our list. If you do decide to stay here:1. Book through Priceline (name your own price) - It goes for as little as $70 a night when the rates on most websites is at best $200.2. Do NOT upgrade to an ocean view room - The view is only partial and hardly spectacular. The way the hotel building is shaped, I doubt there are any rooms at all that provide a clear view of the bay.	
Nov 6 2008 	Nice location  great hotel.	Nice hotel very well located near Bay bridge and ferry Terminal. helpful staff . Particularly recommend upgrade to Regency Club .Many nice restaurants nearby but main restaurant at hotel closed for no apparent reason	
Nov 6 2008 	Treat yourself and upgrade to a room with a view	I booked this room on Priceline and got the room for a bargain. When I checked in, I asked if the room had a view. It didn't, but I was told that for only $35 more I could get a room with a view of the bay. The view was incredible. I didn't want to leave the room after checking in. My only complaint was that since it is a old hotel, I could easily hear my neighbor coughing up a lung throughout the night. I called down and requested ear plugs. They were brought up to my room within 5 minutes. I slept like a baby after that.The hotel is just off the BART line, so the hotel is a straight shot from the airport for just $5.35 each way. Very convenient for those that are traveling on a budget.The concierge staff was very knowledgeable about the downtown area, recommending a great sushi restaurant (Hana Zen) that was within walking distance.I hope to stay here again the next time I'm in San Francisco.	
Nov 2 2008 	This Hotel is not all it's cracked up to be	This is one of the priciest Hotels in the San Francisco Bay area located near Fisherman's Wharf. I thought the hotel would live up to the Hilton name the reason I booked it. The bathrooms are very small and the amenities are old and out of date. There was chipped wood at the counter by the sink and it just wasn't Hilton quality. I paid $215 a night and definitely feel I could have chosen somewhere else cheaper and nicer. Also a friend came by to take me to dinner and left his car for Valet parking while we walked to a nearby restaurant, two hour later he picked up his car for a $57 fee! I feel this hotel is living on it's name alone and needs to kick it up an notch or lower the prices for what it is.	
Oct 21 2008	Almost sci-fi	This hotel will be familiar to any movie buffs, the spectacular lobby area doubled for the hotel in the classic 70's disaster movie &quot;Towering Inferno&quot; and Mel Brooks had a vertigo attack here in &quot;High Anxiety&quot;.The lobby is in fact what makes this hotel, its bigger than anything I've ever seen and reminds me how hotels were supposed to look in the 25th century in earlier science fiction films. It extends to the roof of the hotel and is surrounded on two sides by the corridors of rooms, so that upon opening your room door there's a fantastic view of space, with amazing curtains of light created from floor to ceiling. Multi-coloured glass elevators travel up and down the sides of the lobby and there's even a white water stream flowing through the gardens in the reception area. Worth a visit even if you're not staying here !The location is great, right outside a subway station and at the end point of one of the tram lines, across the road from the Ferry Building next to the Central Business District and bay. Half of the rooms have views to the Bay Bridge. Its a 10 minute walk to downtown/Union Square and the area all around feels perfectly safe to walk in at night. During our winter stay there was also a large outdoor ice rink outside.Rooms are big but my one compaint is that they're looking just a little worn and they were also quite cold. At least they were quiet. Definitely no thrills in this respect, certainly a lot shabbier than any other Hyatt Regency hotel I've stayed in.Everything else seemed to work fine, we didn't try breakfast, opting instead for Taco Bell and the sandwiches on offer at an excellent deli across the road. For those looking for an awesome (albeit very expensive) dining experience, Aqua Restaurant is just 5 minutes walk away. The Crab House and Bubba Gumps on Fisherman's Wharf also come highly recommended.Highly recommended for its distinctive architectural style, it is also a perfect place for tourists to be, due to its downtown location but far enough away from all the hustle and bustle of Union Square/Fisherman's Wharf, whilst still being a short tram/subway/taxi ride from most of the city sights.	
Oct 20 2008 	Great place great location great service high end hotel	We loved the hotel for the proximity to everything! Cable car, streetcar, Muni and Bart all stop outside the front door. Close to the water for a walk. Across the street from the Ferry terminal, which houses a number of fantastic restaurants and shops. It is located in a good district, so you feel very safe walking out of the hotel. We checked out the location of several other hotels and were extremely pleased with our choice. We upgraded to the Regency Club level, and it is worth the extra money if you plan to use the benefits. It does not give you that much better of a room, but if you like light breakfasts, mid-afternoon snacks and evening desserts its worth it. We used it two to three times a day and got our money's worth. Hotel food was good. Service was excellent. Only downside was that the room was smaller than anticipated, but having a huge shower, LCD TV and patio doors that actually opened more than made up for it. There was a bit of street noise from the trains early in the morning, but we are early risers anyways.	
Oct 20 2008	Loved the Hyatt Embarcadero	My husband an I just returned from a 5 day visit to the Hyatt Embarcadero. He had a meeting there and we came a day early. We loved our room (1623)..it was very clean and had a great veiw of the water. What I really loved was the Regency Club on the top floor. Not only did they have a great continental breakfast and great coffee but snacks throughout the day and a lot of food in the evening. You could eat dinner there- but why would you in SF. The 360 degree view, which includes being blocks from the Bay Bridge was fantastic. The employees were friendly too, not that I had much interaction with anyone besides the RC help and the house keeping staff. I really liked this hotel and the location across from the water and the Ferry Building.	
Oct 15 2008 	A potentially good hotel degraded by penny pinching	I just finished a five day stay at the Hyatt Regency, for a conference. The location is great, and we had a room with a good view of the bay. the architecture of the atrium continues to impress me. the poor rating is because they seem to have decided to milk guests of every dime possible and minimize expenditure on maintenance.-When I got to the room, I could not get a wireless signal for my laptop. A call to the front desk produced a wireless bridge that did not work ($250 deposit). After standing in the hall with my laptop over the edge of the balcony, I could get a signal usable enough to find they wanted $10 a day for connection!-The elevator call button on out floor was damaged the second day we arrived and was not fixed for the duration of the stay.-The in-room fridge had a sign that if we used it for any of our own stuff it would activate an automatic charge to the room.-The radio is one of those $5 Walmart specials that would not keep tuned into a station without fiddling with it constantly.It is sad to see a potentially good hotel be degraded by an effort to nickle and dime the guest. Just charge another $20, which won't be a big change to a $250 bill, and provide the minimum that Days Inn provides for free.	
Oct 14 2008 	Beautiful hotel great location!	My husband was staying here for business in September 2008. The hotel was beautiful. We were shocked when we got the final bill though! Luckily, we weren't paying. I'm not sure if the hotel is worth the price tag because I haven't done a lot of research into other prices of hotels in the area.We had a beautiful view from our room. The room itself was really nice and had obviously been renovated recently. The bed was very comfortable and the down pillows were much appreciated.The location is perfect, close to shopping, about a 15 minute walk from downtown shopping and right in front of the Ferry Building. There is so much to do in the area. We used the Budget car rental which is in the hotel, this was very handy to have onsite. The Ferry Building has a lot of nice little shops with fresh bread, cheese and meats. We also ate at the Thai restaurant right next door, Osho Thai restaurant right next door which was delicious, had great decor and reasonably priced. It was also handy having the Starbucks, 7-11 and Walgreens across the street. The views in the area were beautiful. I'd love to stay here again next time we're in San Francisco! However, the price tag might sway me to stay somewhere else.	
Oct 14 2008 	Excellent location to base a visit	The Hyatt at Embarcadero is an older hotel which has been maintained to a good but not exceptional standard. Its real strength is the location - away from the shambles of Fisherman's Wharf or the night-risky areas near Union Square (the latter is not my view but a statement by authorities as to risk spots while we were there). It has one cable car at its front door, the major bus and tram routes next to that, and an easy walk across to the Ferry Terminal (worth a visit anyway for food stalls and cafes). We upgraded to a Club room which entitled us to (amongst other things) light breakfast on the top floor each day looking out across the Bay - a great spot. Over 3 days we found that this is a perfect base for local touring. Good value at the discounted price we paid.	
Oct 13 2008 	Great Overnighter at the Hyatt Regency	We stayed at the Hyatt Regency for 1 night last December after our long flight from Australia to San Francisco. As we were leaving to head to Yosemite National Park the next morning, our only disappointment was that we were not staying here longer.Initially we were a bit hesitant about the area as we arrived at the hotel on our airport shuttle as there was a very heated argument occuring between 4 intoxicated people over a taxi cab at the entry to the hotel. The concierge, obviously seeing us arrive came out and escorted us through a side entry to avoid the situation happening at the front doors.The foyer area was resplendant with its Christmas displays including minature Christmas scences and hanging interior lights that must have been 11 floors high! It was quite something to see.Check in was prompt, professional and friendly. Our room was modern, clean, spacious and had a fantastic view out to the Bay Bridge. The bed was soft and welcoming and those famed Hyatt pillows are just what us weary travellers required to rest our heads after such a long flight.The hotel is central and within walking distance to everything downtown has to offer (Golden Gate Park is quite a hike though - look for public transport to get there). There is a BART station just a minute down the road, and also easy access to taxis and the Amtrak office (and bus pick up location) at the corner of Embarcadero and Mission Streets.Due to our late arrival we didnt get chance to experience the cafe or bar, but did order full hot breakfast room service the next morning which while quite pricey, but first rate. We booked our room through the hotel's website under the special offers and whilst it would not be considered budget, the quality and location of this hotel would definetely see us staying again.	
Oct 13 2008 	Parking Fees are Astronomically Expensive!!	We recently booked a two-night stay at the Hyatt Regency, Embarcardero Center, through Hotwire and got what appeared to be a great deal. (We were charged $109 plus tax per night.) When we arrived at the hotel the valet told us (to our horror) that the charge for parking at the hotel was $57 per day! Given that Hotwire does not release the name of the hotel or charges for hotel &quot;INCIDENTALS&quot; (which apparently parking is considered) prior to paying for the room, we were taken completely by surprise. And given the non-refundable nature of Hotwire bookings, we were stuck paying the $114 to park for two nights.We fully expected to pay around $25/day for parking, but to charge more than half of the cost of the room itself is highway robbery..The hotel was nice enough, but we won't be going back - EVER..	
Oct 7 2008 	One of my new favorites in the city	My fiance and I wanted a fast over night refresher and booked a room via Priceline for $75.00 per night. I was happy when we received the Hyatt, since we have had so many pleasant stays with them in the past at different locations/cities. We were not disappointed with this location. It is ideally located waterfront, and I can't imagine all or a majority of the rooms don't have some sort of Bay view. When we pulled in the professional valet staff quickly assisted my fiance with his car (see other posts I've written about his car!) &amp; I was off to the front desk to check in. Big beautiful glass elevators whisked me away to the &quot;Atrium&quot; level where check in was effortless &amp; complete in all of 2 minutes. I upgraded to a suite for $150 more and couldn't wait to see it! I sat happily at the bar, ordered two drinks &amp; my fiance was back within 10 minutes happy as a clam since his sports car was safely tucked next to a $200k Ferrari in the parking garage. No chance of door dings tonight! Because he assisted the valet with his car, his efforts to tip were politely refused. Drinks gone we headed to the 14th floor to find our Bay View suite, and what a suite it was. Two Large rooms, one was a living area with couch, over sized chair, coffee table, two person barstool &amp; table sitting next to the large sliding glass windows. mini bar, additional refridgerator for our snacks, drinks ect. Flat screen Tv. On the way to the bedroom there is another &quot;guest&quot; bathroom, toilet &amp; sink &amp; built in TV to the Mirror with remote control! Very cool (: The bedroom has a King size bed, work station/desk over looking the City &amp; Bay. The bathroom had a large Jacuzzi tub plenty big enough for two, toilet &amp; separate glass shower with excellent water pressure. The balcony was the best part. It was extra large with two sets of patio furniture, one a table &amp; chair set. The other a two person love seat &amp; table at the other end. We stared at the Bay all night long with the passing ships &amp; the gleaming lights of the Bay Bridge. It was simply stunning &amp; a delicious place to sit out &amp; have cocktails and appetizers. The Room was VERY clean and the only suggestion I have for the hotel are the carpets and maybe a quick clean to the living area furniture. I'm picky and I tell you other posters are being ridiculous. This hotel is 4 star all the way, the staff included. We prefer business hotels because we are low key guests who like to interact with the staff only when needed. Whenever we did, room service and housekeeping were both used, they were beyond polite, fast &amp; attentive. Other than that they left us alone to relax &amp; rejuvinate in our luxery spa room. We will definately stay here in the future and recommend it to anyone. We took a taxi to the Fog City Cafe for $6.00 one way at 10pm. (one of many luxuries in San Francisco is the late night diiners) so I dont know why anyone would ever say there is no where close by to eat! This is a city for foodies! Just think outside the box people, and beyond your Denny's mentality. The choices are absolutely endless. Fog City was fabulous as usual, casual yet delicious. Just perfect for two slightly buzzed &amp; starving travelers. No driving and another fast cab ride &amp; we were back in the comfort of our room. Stay here, I promise you will love it, and DONT take advise of other's who say the upgrade wasn't worth it, they simply don't appreciate the ambience of this gorgeous city for a few extra well worth it dollars. Thank you Hyatt for a fabulous Sunday night stay.	
Oct 7 2008 	Above average Stay...	Stayed at this hotel for 4 days while in SF on business. It reminded me very much of the Marriott Marquis in Times Square. The rooms were nicely renovated, with views of the city or the bay. It was in a very convenient location, right by the Bay, 1/2 hour walk from Pier 39 or a quick 5 minute cab. Also a 15 minute walk to AT&amp;T Ballpark. The minibar wasn't too overpriced, about the same as I'd pay for a beer in a bar. The bedding and pillows were very comfortable, and daily maid service was thorough. The bathrooms were a bit small, but not a big deal. Overall a very pleasant experience.	
Oct 5 2008 	The best experience possible	Booked this via Priceline for less than $125 a night, Bay Side double beds. Business trip. The Hyatt staff made our trip most excellent. Internet connection very slow, only problem.	
Sep 25 2008 	Nice Hotel	I did not find this hotel as bad as some of the comments that were written. I had a great room with a view on the 6th floor that overlooked the ferry building and the bay. I found my room to be very nicely appointed. The bathroom was nice with an outside sink seperate from the toilet and shower. The beds were nice along with the sheets and blanket. The TV was a nice flat screen although, we did not watch a whole lot of it. The location is good and yes, transportation is bountiful right outside the door. The one down side I feel is in the evening all of the little eateries around closed at 4 or 5:00pm. If you wanted a dinner you couldn't pick up a quick bite to eat right outside the hotel. I was told we were in the financial district.And yes, I was there for a convention that had 600 in attendance, so it is a huge convention hotel. I was able to walk easy to catch the Alcatraz boat. Wonderful tour!Which was about about a 15 walk. Overall, Good Experience	
Sep 22 2008 	Just OK	My husband and I recently stayed at this property for a couple of nights. We have generally liked all of Hyatt's properties throughout the US as the chain provides clean and comfortable rooms with professional staff. The Hyatt Regency SF definitely caters to the business/events traveller and although there were no glaring issues, the overall experience was not that great. The hotel itself is a bit dowdy and dark and needs to be updated. Our room (15th floor) had a nice view of the bay yet one of the sliding glass doors was off its track. The small terrace and the deck furniture were dirty. The bathroom toiletries were pleasant and the towels were ok; the bed and linens were comfortable. Unfortunately the shower's combination water faucet/temperature control knob kept sliding towards the hot setting and needed to be constantly reset to avoid getting scalded. Additonally, we ordered room service for breakfast and it did not arrive until 50 minutes later (we were told 30 minutes when placing the order). Additonally, the requested carafe of coffee was actually a carafe of hot water and upon notifying room service of this mistake, it took an additonal 20 minutes for the coffee to be delivered. The wifi signal and resulting access in the room were extremely spotty (I noticed another reviewer mentioning this may be due to being on a higher floor?) and when we mentioned this during check out, Hyatt kindly credited us the daily fee. Overall, the Hyatt provided a decent enough stay yet compared to other Hyatt properties, this particular hotel is average to below average.	
Sep 7 2008	Bed Bugs here bitten on legs during sleep!	Paid for a view room, nary a sliver of water could be seen. Hotel looks like it is stuck in the 80's. The worst is that there are bed bugs present -- we know this because we heard other couples talking about it at breakfast. Stay away. Definitely don't pay extra for a view room as you may not get it (we did not).	
Sep 5 2008 	Always a good stay	I have stayed at this Hyatt many times and it is always great. I was in SF on holiday for a long weekend and stayed here. The hotel itself is a little dated (hallways and even the room design), but the beds are updated and the rooms have flat screen tv's. It's always very clean, the staff is very helpful and you can't beat the location. Some rooms have city views and some have bay views, both are fantastic. As I stated before, you can't beat the location. Ferry Building is across the street, walkind distance to North Beach, China town and Union Square. If you don't want to walk, every form of public transportation is right out the front door (cable car, street car, bus, and BART). And it's almost always easy to catch a cab here. Things I have noticed over the times I've stayed here: The higher floors do not get very good reception for wireless internet, so if you plan on using wireless internet request a lower floor. If you have a room facing Market street, if you open your window it can get a little noisy.Overall, it's a great place.	
Sep 5 2008 	Great Location	My mom and I stayed here for 4 nights, booked via Priceline.We arrived very early for check-in (around 9:30am) and were given a room right away. The GOOD:Excellent location. Right across the road from Ferry Building and the Farmers Market (Tue/Sat only). Lots of public transportation right at the door step: buses, Muni, BART, F trolley, and cable car. A nice 20-min stroll to SF MOMA.However, if you're into shopping, then this may not be the hotel for you as you probably would want something closer to Union Sq. We are not shoppers and we actually enjoy the more quiet location (on nights and weekends) here.The NOT SO GOOD:Our room is on the 3rd floor with a angled view of the Bay and Ferry Building. The way the room is positioned made it very dark, despite bright daylight. Our room is also located at the farthest distance from the elevators - a good 2 min walk just to get there.The Atrium plays muzak 24 hours a day and is pretty loud actually. I can hear it inside our room at night. Good window insulation though as I didn't hear any street noise.Sagging mattress! Way overdue. My bed sags on the side closer to the bedside table. the other side feels at least 2 inches higher.BTW, the 2 beds in our room are only full-size beds. Our room has a flat screen TV but no HD channels.PARKING tip:The hotel charges $57 for parking ($50 + tax). We parked at Embarcadero 4 garage (entrance on Drumm street) for only $30 (24 hr max). As we did not need in-out priviledges, we saved a bunch by parking at Embarcadero 4. From the garage elevator, it is a 1-min walk to the hotel, very convenient. The garage is open 7 days a week from 5am til midnight (7am on weekends).	
Aug 26 2008 	Awesome experience!	With my past Hyatt hotel experiences, this one has by far been the best. I have stayed in the Hyatt @ The Fishermans Wharf and The Hyatt San Francisco Airport. We decided to valet the car with the hotel but from now on I think I will park next door because of the $25 difference. Check-in was a breeze and the hotel had a great feel to it. There was construction right by the check in desk but I had no idea there was until we started to go up the elevators. They have made it look like there is no sign of construction with temporary walls. I am intrigued to see what it looks like when they complete it.I booked the room through Hotwire and was a little skeptical at first but could not have been more pleased. The views we had were amazing! Great pictures of the Bay Bridge and the Embarcadero from our room.The room was normal size but I really liked the furniture placement and bed placement. The bed looked out into the window/balcony?? It does not have windows but has sliding glass doors that open up almost all the way. The one and only thing I didnt like about the room was the bathroom setup. Dont know what it was but I just was not feelin it. You must go down to Noahs Bagels for breakfast when you visit. Great coffee and great bagels! It is basically located at the base of the hotel. There are a string of shops/ cafes along the base.I will definitely be coming back to this hotel!	
Aug 24 2008 	wonderful stay	All in all we had a great 8 night stay here in august 2008. We booked the Embarcadero suite and had stunning views of ferry building and bay bridge - with superb sunsets... Room was very large, 2 teles plus one tv in the mirror in the bathroom. Nice luxurious bed and plenty of sofa space to stretch out.There is an entrance/exit to the hotel via the embarcadero centre which is worth using. It takes you along raised walkways above the streets which are filled with shops and covered seating areas beneath bamboo trees... lovely place to stop and have a coffee...Service in the hotel was very good, cocktails were great and had a very enjoyable stay...Just a few disappointments:Regency Club was very busy as it was school holidays so didn't have that &quot;exclusive&quot;feel - in fact, breakfasts were busiest time and seats difficult to find... Also it could be difficult to get access to either of the two pcs with internet access (no free wifi in the hotel rooms) as they were taken over by the kids and if you did manage to get onto a pc, there would be a queue of kids hovering around waiting for you to vacate... At the quieter times of the season, this would be a great place to hang out .. Breakfasts good, nice light afternoon snacks and evening honesty bar.. However, during school holidays it is quieter to have breakfast in the ground floor restaurant than in the regency club...The fridges in the room have that system whereby the moment you remove something from the fridge it is charged to your room... the fridge has no room for your own stuff (eg milk for your coffee although coffee maker is provided in the room) and to have your minibar fridge emptied of contents costs $40.... so make use of the tea/coffee in the regency club.For such a large hotel with 17 floors of rooms, there are only 5 small lifts ... with no option to use the stairs it can be slow with many people only going one or two floors so progress getting to your room.We had a 15th floor room at the far end of the hotel overlooking the ferry building... this room could be noisy at night as there is a service elevator next to the room which seemed to get unloaded with plates and trolleys during the night ... also there can be some noise carrying up from the street below , especially in the early morning, so unless you like 6am streetnoise waking you up, take some ear plugs...	
Aug 13 2008 	Convenient Affordable Great View - Hyatt Regency Embarcadero	We stayed a single Tuesday night in August. We came to San Francisco to listen to live music, and needed a place to crash after the concert. After parking next door at the Embarcadero #4 next door ($30.00 overnight, no in and out), we walked into and up to the lobby to check in. I believe the hotel valet parking is $54.00 overnight. We had our key in our hands within 8 minutes - very efficient. The room was on the 15th floor and although we were given a King with City View, we had a great view of the Transamerica Pyramid.The hotel is convenient to the Ferry Building, and we hit Hog Island for oysters and wine before going back to our room for a nap before our night out.Taxis are plentiful and we got to the SOMA venue quickly. After our post-club dinner at a late-night restaurant, our taxi quickly took us back. No ride was over $7.We checked out before 7am as we had work at 9am back in Sacramento.We like this hotel because of the convenience to shopping, eating, drinking, dancing, and all of downtown San Francisco.	
Aug 1 2008 	Hyatt Embarcadaro	We had initially stayed at the JW Marriott and then transferred to this hotel for 4 nights. The staff here was very friendly and accomodating. The bell staff was excellent, the concierges went above and beyond the call of duty in terms of being helpful, the maids were very prompt and efficient and overall we enjoyed our stay. We would highly recommend staying at the Regency Club level....the food, service and amenities were excellent there and well worth the little additional we paid. Our only complaint was related to the room itself. The bathroom is very small and outdated, the bed was not particularly comfortable and the room needed some general upgrading. The staff here is well trained and there to serve, the amenities are good, and the place is very clean. If the room was better we would have given the place 5 stars.	
Jul 27 2008	Standard Hyatt experience	This is a standard Hyatt, very conveniently located at he Embarcadero, which means that you can take the BART to the hotel and you have access to the harbor and the Ferry Building to sample SF food. The staff is accommodating, the rooms are clean, the decor is OK and the rooms are reasonably large. Most rooms have a great view of the harbor.	
Jul 25 2008 	Heavenly Hyatt	We travel to San Francisco at least once a year and have stayed at various hotels in the past. The Hyatt Regency has been the most pleasant of stays for us. The hotel is clean, the staff friendly. It seems to be the norm for Hyatt in general as we have stayed at Hyatt Regency's in other locations and all have been great experiences. I would freely recommend the Hyatt Regency San Francisco to anyone traveling there. Kudos to Hyatt.	
Jul 20 2008	An A+ for the Hyatt Regency Club!	We just spent 2 nights at the Hyatt at the Embarcadero in San Francisco. If you ever see a &quot;deal&quot; for their Regency Club-take it! For $259 per night we were upgraded to a suite overlooking the Bay Bridge (we were supposed to have a &quot;city view&quot; on their Regency Club floor). Your room card goes in a special slot in the elevator taking you to the private 18th floor. This Regency Club included an extensive continental breakfast (bagels, lox, cream cheese, oatmeal, cereals, crossionts, etc.) Later there are mid-day snacks: cookies, fruits, warmed mixed nuts, and beverages. At 5 they serve &quot;appetizers&quot;-artisan cheeses, meats, olives, roasted vegatables, with a taco bar one night, and baked salmon and clam chowder the next. At 8 there are cakes and cookies. Beverages (non alcoholic) are available at all times. This comes with a fantastic view of the bay! We only had to purchase a small lunch one day. Not only is the food plentiful, it is top quality. The staff is gracious and helpful at the Regency Club and elsewhere. A Hyatt Employee stopped to ask if we needed help when we looked confused (we were!). We give this hotel an A+. Unfortunately, they have spoiled us forever after this experience. Our &quot;deal&quot; was called &quot;committment/celebrate&quot;. Do NOT hestitate to take this if you see it! Things to do: a street car takes you right to Pier 39 and the Ferry Building (with an amazing Saturday Farmer's Market) is right across the street.	
Jul 17 2008 	Regency Club Rocks	Hyatt Regency San Francisco is taking the elite club scene to the next level. literally. While staying at the property, I discovered that the hotels former revolving restaurant Equinox was recently turned into the prestigious Regency Club Floor and Lounge. The top two floors of the hotel now cater to those looking for a chic and exclusive San Francisco experience. The Regency Club Lounge is divided into four hemispheres: dining, business, entertainment and relaxation and is a safe haven for those who want to unwind and rejuvenate in a private, club-like setting.  My favorite space is the entertainment hemisphere, with large plasma TVs; iPod listening stations; lifestyle and business magazines; and Cranium board games. I also enjoyed the relaxation hemisphere, which is perfect for travelers like me who just need a quiet retreat at the end of the day and a place to enjoy the spectacular panoramic views. Aside from all the amenities, I enjoyed the dining hemisphere, which never stops serving delicious meals (for breakfast, lunch and dinner), snacks and appetizers. The lounge was also a great place to meet up with a few colleagues, where we could chat in private, take in the amazing scenery and nosh on some of our favorite munchies! In this great city of options, Hyatt Regencys new club floor and lounge has me hooked!	
Jul 3 2008 	Fantastic Hotel! Don't rent a car!	This hotel was even more than we expected! This was our first time to San Francisco. We decided not to rent a car. Thank goodness because the BART, Muni and Cable cars are all right outside of the hotel. Staff was wonderful in assisting us. We had a King Bed room 914 that over looked a side street, but we could also see the Bay Bridge. We got a great price via priceline. The restaurant was a little pricey, but we opted for more of the local restaurants. There is a Walgreens, Subway, Starbucks and many other small restaurants close to the hotel so everything was very convienent. It seemed this location was perfect for us. Union Square and Fisherman's warf area were so crowded we felt this area gave us some breathing room. Even if you don't take the public transportation, You can walk to SFMMOFA, Union Square, North Beach (little Italy), Fisherman's Warf if you don't mind some excercise. Walk one way and take the cable car back. Buy the 3 day or 7 day pass at the Port of San Fran on Embarqudero which is accross the street from the hotel in the back. Buy your Alcatraz tickets on line if you plan on going because they sell out. We also walked to AT&amp;T Staduim for a Giants game and took the Muni back. We took the BART to Oakland for the A's game. It's about a 20 min. ride and stops in front of hotel (underground of course) Great TRip, great hotel	
Jun 28 2008 	Adequate	Just completed a 4 night stay at the Hyatt Regency and found it to be OK as far as the accommodations, with less-than-stellar customer service.Check-in was bumpy. Had a reservation for a Regency Suite. I made an online res then called the 800# to confirm that this was a king, 1BR suite with Regency Club access. This was confirmed. Upon arrival, Regency Suites have been renamed and do not have club access. According to the desk agent they never did (kind of confusing....good thing it's been renamed!). Because club access was the main reason I picked the Hyatt over a few other hotels after months of research, and confirmed that my reservation included this, he was able to talk to his manager and provide access. Initially, he told me it would be a significant amount extra per night ($75) on top of the $400 per night I was already paying. I doubt my husband and I could drink $75 worth of coffee and soft drinks in a day (alcoholic beverages are on an honor bar system and are fairly expensive). So, ultimately they did the right thing, but it took a lot of unnecessary back and forth about it and I got the feeling that they thought I was trying to get away with something when I really just wanted what I'd been promised.The room......the one BR suite is very chopped up. There is a BR with a king bed and desk, a master bath with a separate tub and shower with a huge window next to the tub which was nice. Then there is a very small bathroom with just toilet and sink in a small hallway from the living area to the BR. The living area was a generous size and included a balcony that spanned the entire length of the suite with great water views from our 11th floor location. The suite has been recently remodled and has a modern Asian feel, but is very dark (lots of black and grey) and appears to have been done kind of cheap. The only upscale thing about it was the flat screen tv's which were nice. Suite was clean and maid service was done fairly early each day which was nice.Club room......newly remodeled and at the top of the hotel in the former 360 degree revolving restaurant. It no longer revolves but the ability to walk around and see all the views of the city was great! The club room was much more upscale then the rest of the hotel. Service up there seemed to be reserved for a few people. The staff brought food and drinks to a handful of people that we saw day after day....&quot;regulars&quot; I guess. The food was good, fresh baked goods mostly. New massage chairs are nice.Service......concierge forgot to make a reservation for my husband's birthday dinner. When I didn't get a call back the day after the request, I found another concierge who took care of it. They said they informed the restaurant it was his birthday, but they didn't and the hotel certainly did nothing to recognize it. There was one exceptional concierge named Stacie who was great with suggestions, the others seemed bothered by questions.All in all, it was clean and adequate. Nothing about the place that makes me eager to return. I'd go back to the Omni in a heartbeat....stayed there two years ago and it's true when you read that they call you by name and remember who you are each time you come down near the desk.... one of the best customer service hotels I've ever encountered. Omni treated me like I was their most important guest all of the time, Hyatt, not so much!	
Jun 20 2008	Nice Hotel good location	Great location. Walking distance to most things downtown. Staff were willing to move our room due to the original one being located overlooking the ice rink which was due to play loud music until late in the evening. Rooms and bed were fine. On par with other hotels. One warning I would share is that parking in the hotel is outragiously expensive (around $50-$60/day). Also, the staff working at the budget rental car desk located in the hotel were extraordinarily unhelpful (bordering on rude) and they close in early afternoon on weekends forcing you to effectively pay for overnight parking in the hotel (unless you can find street parking) which, as noted above, is extremely expensive.	
Jun 19 2008 	Wanted to teke the shampoo to compensate-- but a great location	I will start with the positives. Beautiful lobby and central space. Great location that is perfect for a San Francisco visit - close to the ferry terminal, beautiful public spaces nearby, walking distance to downtown, Chinatown and waterfront. Just off of BART and streetcars. Many nice restaurants and eateries very close by. Walgreen's across the street. Lovely and quick glass elevators. Room was pleasing.  Now the negatives. For almost 300/ day I expected more than this. The business center charges 50 cents a minute for internet use. The refrigerator in your room is a computerized minibar that you cannot put your own water in without getting charged. The bed was like a canoe for my spouse and I; we kept rolling to the center! My daughter slept alone in a bed and had no complaints. The linen was nice on this bed, I just wish the mattress had been! The sink had faucets that were almost impossible to turn off with wet hands. I would have to dry my hands and then turn off water, and getting the right mix of hot and cold was impossible, once your hands were wet. So I suffered through too hot hand washings. The balcony space was appreciated, but I didn't like the railing made of slotted concrete. So, great location, and try to get a deal, or take the shampoo!	
Jun 17 2008	Good Location indifferent service	I liked the location of this hotel, it is very convenient to the Ferry Building and the California Street cable car. It is also great if you happen to be returning a Budget rental car as you just leave the car out front and formalities are quickly dealt with at a dedicated desk at the reception level.I had a refurbished club room on the 17th floor. The room which overlooked Market Street was fine but not exceptional. It had a great view of the Bay Bridge. The semi open bathroom just had a shower but the water temperature was so hot that it was almost impossible to have a shower. I reported the problem twice during my stay but nothing was ever done about it. When I mentioned it at check-out the receptionist simply removed a $8 phone charge in compensation. I was surprised that no toweling robes were supplied, toiletries were rather ordinary and room information was almost non-existent.The top floor Club Lounge was very pleasant and offers great views. Staff here were friendly and a good range of food items are offered although the rather limited range of alcoholic beverages are charged for. Other staff throughout the hotel made little impression and I thought my arrival was very poor. There was no welcome from the door staff and I was left to handle my luggage out of the car, up to reception and then to the room. Overall, one of my poorer Hyatt experiences.	
Jun 15 2008 	Nice location	I stayed here for a conference. The staff were helpful and the Atrium is quite a grand place. The room was fine - clean and spacious. Slightly odd smell to the hotel, probably something in their cleaning fluids? The hotel is close to the Piers and everything you want to see is within walking distance. Some of the reviewers have complained about the high price of breakfast. There is a croissant/bun shop ('Les Croissants') just across the road from the hotel entrance, I'd recommend buying breakfast from there.	
Jun 13 2008 	Very nice place	Stayed at the Hyatt for a conference in the hotel. We checked in very late and were upgraded to a suite on the 17th floor for $219. The view was incredible, looking SE out over the bay and the Bay Bridge. The room was very nice -- three TV's, including one in the bathroom mirror(!)The bed was comfortable with a nice selection of pillows. Minibar was way overpriced, as was the breakfast options in the hotel. There is a Starbucks across the street and a Peet's about a block away, so go there instead. Many breakfast options around. The service in the hotel was very nice. Everyone was friendly. The concierges were very helpful in navigating the BART on a couple excursions around the area.The hotel is a nice walk (just less than a mile) from Union Square, the big shopping district and from SFMOMA, which is a great museum. We walked Market Street several times.The hotel is RIGHT next to the California St Cable Car line and the Embarcadero entrance to MUNI and BART. Access to all these transportation options could not have been easier or closer.Parking at the hotel is very expensive. We paid $57 for one night until we could offload our rental car the next morning.	
Jun 9 2008 	Great hotel in SF	We stayed at this hotel for one night for a wedding at the Ferry Building, and we loved our experience. Our room actually had a balcony overlooking the Ferry Building. Finding a room with a balcony in SF can be hard, so we were very pleased. We ordered room service for breakfast, and it was great as well. I would suggest staying here while in San Francisco.	
Jun 4 2008 	Great Hotel - My New Favorite	Ive stayed at this property three times now in the past 3 months. Each time I have been impressed by the professionalism and helpfulness of the front desk staff. The last trip I had my mother with me for her first visit to San Francisco. I required two queen beds and wanted a BALCONY room so that we could enjoy our own private space to sit outdoors and enjoy views of the bay. The staff were very helpful in getting me this room - apparently they only have a few balcony rooms with two beds. I highly recommend the balcony rooms. THey are completely updated with flat screen tvs, the baths are updated - bot totally redone but very adequate. The highlight for us was the newly opened REgency Club space which is situated in the space that was previously occupied by the revolving restaurant. While it no longer revolves, it offers fantastic panorama views of the city and bay and excellent service, food, and beverage morning and night. THe staff here go above and beyond and the hotel has succeeded in creating a very special haven from a stressful day. By far the best Club room I've visited within the Hyatt chains.	
May 29 2008 	Better than Most	The Hyatt Regency San Francisco is much better than I expected after reading the previous reviews. I am always surprised at the negative comments such as &quot;average room&quot; or &quot;old hotel&quot;. If you reserve a regular room, you get just that, a regular room. If you want something extra, reserve a suite. Yes, it was built over 30 years ago, but there are some advantages to that. The common areas are much larger than other hotels and there is a huge atrium. When you are inside the atrium, it is so quiet and peaceful that it is hard to tell that the hustle and bustle of the city is just outside the door.The reality is that this is a Hyatt is like every other large Hyatt hotel in a big city. It is big, clean, staff are friendly and accommodating. Although the regular rooms are average in size, like all Hyatts I know, they are clean, well decorated and comfortable. As previously stated, the hotel is walking distance to Fisherman's Wharf (1 mile?) Union Square, (3/4 mile) and of course BART, buses and cable cars stop right out the front door.All things are relative of course depending on your expectations, and how much you pay for the room. But if you dont have Champagne tastes and a beer budget, you will be happy with this hotel.	
May 23 2008 	Central Location and excellent staff	We stayed at the Hyatt Regency for five nights May 16. We booked on Priceline and were given a beautiful room on the 17th floor.Staff were excellent, professional, helpful and polite.Ann, Vancouver Canada	
May 4 2008 	Excellent Hotel and Location	This Hotel is in a excellent location close to SF Bay and Trolley Cars with the BART station adjacent to the Hotel.Stayed at this Hotel after a terrible stay as the Westin in Market Street SF,and the differences are huge.This is a modern construction which does NOT shake,rattle and roll when its windy in SF.The Hotel's restaurants are great and breakfast is excellent with wonderful staff especially reception and dining room.Its location allows a wonderful walk to most attractions or catch the Bart.TIP.....catch the BART to SF Airport from the Hotel!!!	
Apr 24 2008 	Disappointed	Check my other reviews, I generally only write when I love a hotel, but we had problems with the regency from the beginning. When we checked in, despite being GUARANTEED a KING size bed we were given a room with a full size bed (Yes FULL not queen). When I went down to request a different room I was told that there wasn't anything available that night but the manager would call me the following morning. Well no call, and when I asked that morning they said the manager would call, well he never did. On top of that our air conditioning didn't work, and it was hot in San Francisco that weekend, it took them two days to fix it. However, the hotel has a beautiful lobby, and was in relatively central location.	
Apr 24 2008	old hotel	My girlfriends and I stayed at this hotel on the 18th-20th. I got a good deal through Priceline. The room was not modern, the tv was old school and there was a draft at night. But it was clean. We had two double beds, but they seemed smaller than normal. It's an old hotel, but you can't beat the location. It's so close to the Ferry Building which I love! The concierge was extremely helpful and nice. Parking: If you valet at the hotel it's $50. We parked at the Embarcadero center for $30, but there is no in and out privileges.	
Apr 21 2008 	A Little Tired	This Hotel was billed as a 4 star Hotel on Hotwire. I would guess that that was true about 10 years ago. First the good: It is in a great location particularly if you are doing business in the financial district. It is also close to China Town, the Ferry Building market, the waterfront and plenty of public transportation including the California street cable car. Like any Hyatt, it has a very impressive atrium housing a couple of restaurants and a cocktail lounge. Many of the rooms have balconies and many of those have water views. The problem is that the rooms are just beginning to look tired. The carpets are somewhat worn, the furniture has its share of scratches, no flat-screen HD TV's or DVD players, everything just needs to be updated. While the beds are generally quite comfortable, on my last trip one side of the bed had a distinct sag. Also be forewarned that the rooms on the Market St. side of this Hotel get a lot of street noise if you are on one of the lower floors. Like any business hotel, they are geared toward people on expense accounts so be prepared to pay through the nose for anything extra. Wireless Internet service is $10 per day, parking is about $50 per day and how about a couple of poached eggs for $19 bucks ... you get the picture. All in all it was worth the $110 I payed on Hotwire, but would require some updating to get me to pay anything like their rack rate of over $200.	
Apr 19 2008 	Mixed review	I stayed at the Hyatt for a conference. The &quot;conference rate&quot; offered to the attendees was the same as the regular rate posted on the hotel website, which I found a little odd. The hotel is in a great location, convenient to BART and right on the Embarcadero. The Ferry Building (across the street) is a fantastic place with wonderful restaurants and shops - we ate there several times during the conference. We also were lucky to have wonderful weather, and it was great to be able to stroll out of the hotel for a nice walk along the bay.The hotel is nice, but not outstanding. My room had a bay view (I paid for the upgrade) and a balcony, which was nice - beautiful morning view of the piers. The weird thing is, if you sit on the (very comfortable) balcony furniture, you can't see anything because the concrete railing is tall and thick. The room, as noted in other reviews, was nice, but kind of basic. Very nice bed and bedding, and very comfy desk chair, but the bathroom is kind of vintage, and the lighting over the bathroom sink is pretty bad. My room also had studs on the wall where apparently a framed picture once was; gave the room a half-finished look. The temperature control in the room was inefficient; there's one vent near the ceiling that pushes air in the general direction of the tv; takes a while to cool or warm the room, which was a problem as the large balcony door/window meant it was a bit drafty. Also, in my bathtub, the shower faucet was loose enough that it wouldn't stay put at the chosen temperature; the handle would just slowly sink until the water was scalding. I solved it by wedging a cardboard coffee cup sleeve (from the coffee service) between the handle and the rest of the fixture to stop the thing from sliding down, but sheesh.I didn't eat in the hotel, as there are so many other (less-expensive) options in the area. You have to pay $10 daily for internet, which always annoys me in hotels, especially those with rates like the Hyatt's. Housekeeping also was very late the first day I was there (i.e., returned to a still un-cleaned room at 4:30pm). It was subsequently cleaned earlier (not sure if that had to do with the fact that I leave a daily tip with a thank you note). Housekeeping staff I passed in the hallway were unfailingly friendly and courteous.I can't recommend the Hyatt for people who are expecting true 4 or 5 star accommodations, although the location is great and the staff are good.	
Apr 10 2008 	Great Hotel	This holiday was a suprise for my 30th Birthday and it didn't disappoint. San Francisco is a lovely city, great weather and lots to see and do. It has a different feel from alot of your US Cities.On arrival to the Hyatt Regency we were greeted by a very friendly guy who assured us we had a nice room and he was right, the room was on the 10th floor with a side view of the bay, it was lovely. The rooms are very big and the bed is even bigger, we stayed for 6 nights and this room was very comfortable for us,The lobby area looks great and has a very nice feel to it, not stuffy at all and very welcoming.The staff are extremely polite and accomodating and the guys on the door,Location is perfect, in the financial district but on the outskirts and a 20 min walk along the front will take you to the hub of Fishermans Wharf.I would say the only disappointment was the revolving restaurant being cloased until May 08 , this was something we were not made aware of, but over all a great stay and would highly recommend.	
Apr 9 2008 	Horrible	Hotel is very dated and looks like it hasn't been updated since the early 80's. You will be charged for everything! $55 per day for parking (and we were not told), mini-bar charges are high, a veiw will cost $35 more per day. Management was rude and criticized us for booking on priceline. I've stayed at Hyatt hotels before and loved them! I don't understand why this location had such poor service.	
Apr 9 2008 	Okay for a short trip	The Hyatt Regency San Francisco is clearly a dated hotel, but renovations to the rooms have kept it up to par with other mid-level Hyatts (although it may be a bit overpriced). The location is great, right on the Embarcadero and across from the Ferry Terminal. There is also a cable car line right outside the door. We did go through 3 rooms before finding one that was nice, due to awkward window placement in the first rooms. The front desk staff was very kind as well as the concierge. Valet parking was $50/day and the valet threatened that other parking lots were far more expensive. I guess that comes with the territory in San Francisco.	
Apr 3 2008 	Awesome wiht a capital A	The Hyatt is one of the cities hospitality gems. I had the opportunity to stay in one of their new Regency Club rooms and they are incredible. Although Regency Club cost more money, you get access to their roof top lounge (on par with the concierge levels at Ritz, etc) and has the best views in all of San Fran. There are also 5 daily food presentations (including breakfast, snacks, apps and dessert) and tye are all to die for, I highly recommend you check out the new Regency Club rooms on your next trip to San Fran. It is well worth it.&quot;	
Mar 30 2008 	Loved it!	I booked two adjoining rooms here for two nights on the hotel website and paid $143 for each room.I found the hotel location perfect for our needs. We caught a taxi to the hotel from SFO and then rented a car from the Budget desk in the lobby two days later. I had read of the high cost of parking a car here and figured we would rely on public transit during our stay and then rent the car when we were ready to leave for our journey South which worked out well.The staff was great. I had a coupon for $100 off my stay and there was no problem in redeeming it. I had requested two double beds in each of the two rooms and this was granted. They initially told me they had me in a King and a double but then two days before I left home they emailed me that they were able to accommodate my request for adjoining rooms with two coubles in each. I was impressed with this.I called the hotel prior to arrival to confirm everything since I was traveling with my mom, a niece, and a friend of the niece and wanted all the details to go well--all did.We had a tour on the first morning and it left from the ferry terminal--a short walk away. Since the hotel is in the financial district many of the places near the hotel cater to the business community and don't stay open in the evenings. The shops in the ferry terminal are great for lunch but close early. We walked down to Sinbad's, adjacent to the ferry bldg for one evening meal and it was okay, but pricey for the quality. The hotel room was great. I did not appreciate the Internet fee or the annoying mini-bar that I had to warn the kids about opening due to the senstive nature of the contents, etc. I really wish hotels would abandon using these things, but the water pressure in the room was good and the beds were comfortable. The walls were a bit thin and like a previous reviewer we had a domestic disturbance in the room next door with lots of yelling and screaming and profanity--all of this after we were in bed so quite annoying and not the fault of the hotel. At one point I thought I might need to call security, but they finally quieted down before I felt compelled to have someone intervene. We had daily newspaper delivery, reading material in the room, and nice amenities. All in all-- a very good stay and I would stay here again. Easy to get taxi at hotel or trolley behind hotel across from the terminal--	
Mar 29 2008 	Good hotel excellent location	December 2007 was my second time at Hyatt Regency San Francisco. The location is perfect to explore most attractions. There is a metro station and a cable car stop within a walking distance. The Port of San Francisco is across the road. It is one of the best views of Bay Bridge. Powell Street is within walking distance.The outstanding design reduces some room space. The hotel has not changed significantly since my first stay in early 1990's. Although the rooms had minor improvements, there is more to be done.The rooms are clean and comfortable. Wifi is available. The restaurant staff is very friendly. The breakfast is very good. The Equinox restaurant was closed, leaving me somewhat disappointed.	
Mar 24 2008 	Great Location For Financial District-Walking To Embaradero 	PARKING- $55 TOTAL with in and out privelages. Stuck with paying the fee as other parking lots available BUT not in and out privelages.We got a great price on priceline.com for $65 for $83 total. I immediately called the hotel directly and yes they had my reservations BUT I needed to confirm my bed choice. CHECK-IN; easy, no problems. Asked if I wanted to upgrade to a baloncy with view for $35; declined. Our room was 5th floor which had a sideview of the Golden Gate bridge and was directly across some bldg but view was fine. The window opened which was unusal but nice.BED; COMFY, COMFY, down comforter with 6 fluffy pillows. I loved the bed!!!OVERALL DECOR; nice, simple and comfortable and nice size comfortable for two. I think this would be okay for 2 adults and 2 small kids with the 2 double beds. The shower was a bit dated but overall clean. Couldn't ask for more.RESTAURANT; We had late night desserts which were really good and for about $23 with tips. Pricey but convenient. A guy had a filtet mignon dinner which looked appetizing and I heard him say how good it was. Service was good and attentive.BAR- looked nice but we didn't have a drink thereROTATING RESTAURANT- No longer. Being renovated to the Hyatt Club. I guess this is fine for the high spenders but it's too bad as we had eaten there one time and it was nice for the ambiance.VALET PARKING- Attentive, fast. No complaints.LOCATION- We were able to walk outside and there is a huge section of Embarcadero shopping. Closed on Sunday maybe because it was Easter. This could be fun when open. STARBUCKS right across the street. Bistro Burgers opened right across the street.Walk a few blocks and they had vendors selling goods; think was for the weekend only.Across the street was the Ferry Bldg; this had alot of cute shops and restaurants to walk around. We walked this route to Pier 39 and then to Fisherman's Wharf. Not a bad walk with lots to look out.We walked to North Beach and then back to the hotel. It was alot of walking BUT Overall for the price and location it worked out fine.	
Mar 24 2008 	Great stay at the Hyatt Embarcadero	Just spent a nice, comfortable week at the Hyatt Embarcadero. I took BART from the airport, and the Embarcadero station is literally across the street from the hotel. This was my second time here. The front desk was courteous and gave me an early check-in, and the lobby area was immaculate. With six elevators, I never had to wait more than 30 seconds the whole time I was there. I was fortunate to get a business class room on the 6th floor, which means it's controlled by an access key and you get a work desk and chair with ottoman in a nice-sized room. I had a great view of the &quot;San Francisco&quot; sign and the piers. The room itself was immaculate - I actually didn't see one thing wrong with it. I have to say that the bed wasn't a fluffy Marriott bed, but I found it to be comfortable. I also always had a hot shower with full pressure, which was nice. I ate once at the hotel cafe, only because I got a free continental breakfast voucher. There were more than the standard melons on the fruit tray, including shaved salmon, plus a good variety of hot and cold cereals, yogurts, juices, and coffee. The menu says this is priced at $19, which I personally think is double what it should be, but it's a nice splurge if you had to pay for it. I've actually eaten here before during another stay, and the food is really, really good, just expensive. I managed to save money by eating at Subway or the shops in The Embarcadero; I never ordered room service. As for the $9.95 internet charge, I wouldn't pay it if I were on vacation, but I think the management knows their hotel is going to be used primarily for business folks like me who are going to expense the cost.  I've stayed at the Hilton (rooms the size of a walk-in closet!) and the Park Galleria, which is why I chose the Hyatt Embarcadero again. You really can't beat its convenience to BART, the Embarcadero shops, and the Walgreens and Starbucks across the street.	
Mar 18 2008 	Wouldn't stay again	Another reviewer spoke of the added fees for everything. We brought our own laptop and it cost $9.95 a day for a wireless connection. On the last day, we decided just to use the business center to print out boarding passes, check e-mail, etc... These were complimentary, but if you did anything else, it was .50 a minute. Also on our last day, we decided to eat breakfast in the Atrium. The menu prices were outrageous, so we opted for the Continental buffet - w/o asking the price. It was $27 a person for what you normally get for free at any Embassy Suites. Luckily we didn't rent a car - the price to park was $50 a night.  The concierges were hit and miss. Some were helpful - some were rude. Trying to figure out the transportation system was crazy-we have used the transit systems in London, Paris, and NY w/o a problem. San Fran is crazy. You have to get off the upper cable cars then go underground to go on to other destinations. When we ask one concierge to help us out, he became exasperated. Luckily the woman working next to him said the transit system is odd and gave us a better explanation on how to get around. Our room was okay - we had a bay view but the room was very drafty. When we turned on the heat, the fan squeaked all night. They have a mini bar which you do not dare to touch or they will charge you. We would have preferred having an empty frig, but they charge $30 to empty the mini bar so you can use if for your own items. There is also a problem with vagrants near the hotel. We never left w/o a homeless person begging us for money. In the underground transit, a guy offered to give us advice on how to navigate the system, then asked for money. My husband gave him a couple of dollars and we left. For the price, I won't stay at this Hyatt location again.	
Feb 29 2008 	Great location hard to fault	Three of us [self, wife and 12 year old] spent 6 nights at the hotel. Some reviewers had given the Hyatt poor reviews. We loved it. Sure the atrium is a little bit 80s but staff were positive and helpful. Because the Regency Club was closed for 'renovations' we were upgraded to the buffet breakfast in the atrium cafe. This was an unexpected bonus. Fabulous selection of food. [we didn't need lunch]. Attentive staff kept topping up juice and coffee to the point of being annoying. Hyatt is in the 'financial district' which is preferable to the touristy Pier 39 area. Peir1 is an excellent upmarket source of food - fabulolous cheese shop; but I can't remember it's name. Cable car, street cars, trolloey buses at your door. Buy a MUNI pass.The express check out is brilliant ... your account is put under the door ... if you agree with it, dial a 4 digit number and answer the yoice prompts and check out is complete. Leave the door access cards in your room and go. Great when you have a 5.30 am flight to catch. Only minor negative was the domestic argument in the next room on our last night; but this disturbance can happen in any hotel sadly.	
Feb 29 2008 	Loved the Hyatt	My wife and I stayed on holiday last November and had a great time.Th lobby is wonderful looking up 17 floors to the top. This was made even better with a huge Christmas tree and decorations hanging down about six or seven floors.True the hotel looks in need of refurbishment, but all publics area do their job and the room was absolutely fine- the view was wonderful - we were on the 17th floor overlooking the Bay Bridge.The waiting staff were very attentive and breakfast and we could not fault any aspect of our stay.	
Feb 20 2008 	Good location but hotel is dated	I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights to attend a conference. It has good accessibility and no car is needed. The BART train from the airport arrives just an escalator ride away from the front entrance of the hotel. It has easy access to many places in downtown San Francisco such as Chinatown (an easy 5 block walk) and a short street car ride to Pier 39 and Fisherman's Wharf. The hotel rooms have nice views of the Bay bridge and the port across the street. The nearby small park usually has vendors selling crafts and jewelry. The rooms were of average size, not too exciting, and the sliding doors were really drafty. The bed was comfortable. Internet access is 9.95 a day, and should be included in a room costing 289.00 a night. The food we had supplied through the conference was very good, continental breakfasts with freshly made baked goods that reminded me of european-quality bakery items. The staff was helpful with directions. This is a good choice if you do not have a car to see the city and you need easy access to the airport.	
Feb 19 2008	Wait for the renovation	Time for Hyatt to catch up with modern day. Nice people, but the facility leaves much to be desired. 32&quot; regular TVs, musty carpet and dated bathrooms are a dead giveaway.Don't stay here if you need to be right next to the Moscone. It is a brisk 15 minute walk at best.Don't bet on room service selection, b/c they are very limited and looks like they havent updated the menu in over a decade. (from the stains on it and the small selection.If you have other options in the category of hotel.... wait for the renovation and take the other alternative.	
Feb 6 2008 	Would never go back!	We stayed at the Hyatt due to it's proximity to the Embarcadero Center, where our company has an office. I can't argue with the convenience, but that simply isn't enough. This hotel obviously experienced it's heyday in the late 70s and early 80s. Attempts that have been made at renovation are superficial. I checked on the website after we checked in, to confirm that it said &quot;granite bath.&quot; A piece of granite has been placed over the old vanity top. The bathtub itself (and the fixtures, lighting etc) is reminiscent of your average roadside Holiday Inn from the late 70s.We were given the option for an upgraded bay-view room on checkin, for an additional $40/night. It rained during our stay, and we awoke to significant water leaking through the sliding door. We informed the management, but nothing was ever done. The gym is comically small for such a large hotel, and again clearly an afterthought. Only a few machines and no real room to do free weights, etc.Overall, we paid a significant price for a very marginal hotel. Hyatt should be more careful with it 's name.	
Jan 29 2008 	It was nice but...I mean it is a Hyatt...what I expected but nothing stellar	I stayed at the Hyatt from Jan 24-27th for a conferenceThe first night rate was 269 and the other two nights were 200 (conference rate)...Please also see my Parc 55 review during the same stay.1. Location and Size: Unlike the Parc 55 hotel which has 1000 rooms compared to this hotel's 800, the Hyatt feels massive. The moment you walk off its street level you are shown a map that has all its various levels for conference rooms and check in etc. Once I found the atrium to check in ( left the luggae with the bellman) I was asked it I wanted to upgrade my room for 35 dollars a night to a bay view. I said no thank you. I figured I wouldn't get an upgrade anyway. I mean it is a Hyatt so they kinda give off the vibe they don'ty have to try and impress you with perks such as upgrades get to make you smile. Kinda like, &quot;if you had the money you would of gotten it already&quot;. It was ok, I had had my great view the night before :). It was raining a lot so I didn't take in the locations pro/cons. Overall it was an asset. The cable car stops in front of the hotel and you can get a troplly to FWarf if you'd like in front of the Ferry building. The cons were that since it is in the financial district all the nearby stores like Starbucks, Coffe bean and tea leaf, and Walgreens closed super early. No 11pm coffee here. Staff: When I went up to my room the first time I found it has just been finished being cleaned. I noticed later that there was a sink problem (no biggie the sink just fiulled up quickly) I guess the maid from the previously must of reported it becaue the next afternoon I had a matienance man show up to unclog the sink. I just wished the hotel at notified me with a phone call because I had to wait 15 min for the facilities person to fix the sink when I had wanted to relx and change clothes for the next part of my day (post conference). The concereige had a great attitude and was fery helpful in sending me to the Ferry Building for Food which was AWESOME ( you must go|)Room: It was nice, ok view, bit of the bay. You have to be cool with your inner exhibitionist because bascically since I was on the 7th floor (or 10 by their elevator) I was smack in front of a bunch of office buildings so people can watch you if the draps are opened ( didn't matter much to me). CON: The mini-bar. If you TOUCH or MOVE anything, you WILL BE CHARGED FOR IT..the pro was that all the locals I told this story were shocked and laughed with me about how absurd it was. If you want to rent the fridge it is $30 bucks a day and the housekeeping staff must remove all the items. Other facts: Their restaurant on the rooftop is closed currently. That would of been nice. The business center charges 5.95 for 15 min of internet and 35 cents after that. You cannot charge it to your room and must use a credit card. I mean it was ok..the conference was well-organized, and I did grow to like the Hyatt. It just wasn't stellar with the exception that the Ferry Building, its food and gifts is the BEST!	
Jan 26 2008	Spectacular architecture and great location!	The lobby is an architectural wonder, and the rooms are quiet and very comfortable. Great amenities, knowledgeable and professional staff. Location is ideal -- in the financial district, walking distance from the Embarcadero piers, Chinatown, North Beach, and other tourist locations.	
Jan 10 2008 	Nice but.	They will nickle and dime you to death. Food service exhorbitant, $10 per day for internet. A charge to open the minibar even if nothing used.	
Jan 7 2008 	Loved this Hotel!	We stayed at this hotel during the week between Christmas and New Year's and it was awesome. My husband and I were traveling with our three children and their two cousins, so we had two rooms. The rooms were beautiful and unusually large for a hyatt and a big city. There is an entrance area to the room that is separate from the room itself, and is a great area for storage, so the room, itself, doesn't feel cluttered. We had an awesome view of the Bay Bridge, which we were not at all expecting. (Ask for a room facing the water/bridge; it costs the same and is much nicer than looking at another tall building.) The lobby is beautiful with stunning lights hanging from the extremely tall (17 floors?) ceiling. At christmastime, the lobby is decorated with holiday villages that are spectacular. The kids loved looking at them. The location of the hotel is great. You are across the street from the Ferry Building, which has lots of stores/restaurants, and you are a 15 minute walk away from Union Square and a large indoor shopping mall on Market Street. You could also probably walk to Pier 39 and Fisherman's Wharf. Since we were a party of seven, we could not all fit into one cab. So, we often took the hotel limousine, which costs about $30. to take you (one way) to most places in the city. (This price was only slightly more than paying for two cabs, and obviously much more pleasant. The limo driver was very nice and the car was clean and roomy.) Overall, I highly recommend this hotel, and would definitely stay there again.	
Jan 4 2008 	Comfortable 	Hyatt Regency was a very nice hotel, with a spectacular open-air lobby ... streamed with holiday lights and Christmas village, train displays during our stay. Upon entering the lobby via escalators, one is overwhelmed with the lights cascading from the top.The front desk was pleasant, though not very flexible. We booked a room via Priceline bid, and requested a high floor, but given lower floor. Given the hotel did not seem fully booked or crowded, we presumed it was b/c we booked thru Priceline (and the low rate). In fact, the front desk tried 'selling' us on an upgrade for a higher floor, with balcony, with a view of SF Bay for an additional $30. That's a third of our rate! We declined.The room was on the 4th floor and had a view of Market Street, and the SF-Oakland Bay Bridge. So we got some views anyway... The room was fine, with King size bed, basic toiletries, coffee maker...and an in-room safe. The bathroom was a little small, and dated but sufficient. Our only issue was the a/c-heat was not very consistent. Wish they had a thermostat vs a cool-warm range for fan, and there was no auto setting. At times it was very warm, and vice versa .. .depending on when we turned on, how long, etc. Not a big deal, as we weren't in room much.Hotel is at the Embarcadero area, mostly offices .. but very convenient to the Ferry building, street cars, BART, buses and cable car terminus on California St (essentially right outside of hotel). At night, it's very quiet, given offices empty out, and especially the weekend when we were there. They did have weekend food market and arts/crafts vendors selling wares between the hotel to the Ferry building. Overall, a pleasant stay here. Easy access to public transportation and waterfront.	
Jan 3 2008 	Nice hotel but does everything have to be so expensive?	OK So I only stayed here for 2 nights while traveling for work, but I did get enough time to poke around and make a few notes.This hotel has one great feature, that being the view you can get of the bay and in particular the Bay Bridge.The service was really good I had asked the conceirage desk a few times for suggestions on where to eat and about how to get to places and every time they had accurate knowledge and I felt confident in finding where to go.The quality of the room was nice, but I would say that a good spring or fall cleaning is needed more than what they actually do in the rooms.If you're not afraid of heights definitely get a higher floor room if possible.The bed was nice, it did have a bit of a dip in it, but I have seen worse.Checking in was easy and the lobby/atrium was very nicely decorated with lights, probably for the holiday season.Checking out was even easier. I told them my room number and they printed me a receipt, done.They did even have a airline check in PC available at the front desk which made for an easy way to check in for our flight.With the BART, ferry and trolley's all in this area it was very easy to get around the area and to/from the airport.Personally I don't think I would book this hotel again, but if I couldn't go to my first choice for San Fran, this would be a decent back up option.	
Jan 1 2008 	Great location. Rooms need an upgrade	We stayed here due to the great location. At the top of the escalator from Embarcadero Bart/MUNI, across the street from the Ferry Building, California Street Cable car outside the front door and walkway to Embarcadero shopping (Chevy's, Tony Romas, Gaylord, and others). Definitely loved the location.The lobby and the overall service was great as expected from a Hyatt.We did have a couple issues:1) The rooms and hallways are dated. TV is smaller (not flat screen), art/walls look a bit worn, and the overall feel is dated once outside the lobby area.2) The breakfast buffet was nice but expensive ($27.00 ) We got two free buffets with AAA but this didn' cover our kids, so we still had to pay half for each child. From around 9:15 on, there was a longish line for the buffet3) The room featured Grand Hyatt linens. These were great. However, for some reason, the beds didn't have a mattress pad, just the fitted sheet over the bare mattress. Odd.Again, excellent staff and service. We would stay here again due to the location. However, as the other reviews also state, if a high class hotel is what you are looking for over location, the Grand Hyatt might be a better fit.	
Dec 10 2007 	Beautiful views from hotel balconey!	Great location for going to the Piers and good resturants all in walking distance. Also great for using the cable cars and street cars to get to other places as they picked you up right outside. Recommend getting a room with a balconey that faces the ocean...beautiful views!! It was a comfortable stay, nice beds and shower. Would recommend this hotel.	
Dec 8 2007 	Great hotel overall	Our first trip to the states and this hotel was recommended to us by friends.We stayed 7 nights and the first room we had was facing the city ,this was fine but became very noisy in the early hours as refuse collectors made a lot of noise. We were moved to a side bay view which was much better if a little darker(natural light).This is generally a well appointed hotel in a good location for the major attactions, public transport has good links and the california line tram is right outside the hotel . Price included breakfast which was excellent , great choices and very friendly/helpful staff.The hotel was clean and all the staff seemed friendly. I would recommend this hotel as all round it was very good value, and made an excellent base from which to explore the city and surrounding area.	
Dec 6 2007 	A Bit Pricey I Prefer the Grand Hyatt for a Better Value	November 2007  I spent six nights at Hyatt Regency San Francisco property while I was attending Linkage's Talent Summit &amp; Workshops offered onsite. My stay was good but in October I stayed three nights at Grand Hyatt on Union Square which I feel is better value. Smaller rooms but a better value.I checked in on rainy Saturday early afternoon (around the time of the oil tanker spill in SF Bay). I had taken the Amtrak train from the Sacramento valley to Emeryville, CA. I used the Amtrak connector bus to SF which drops you off right in-front of this property. On my return trip I caught the bus at the Ferry Building nearby with the assistance of Monna.Check in was smooth and my room was good size and there was a high king size bed. The bed was very comfortable. There are feather pillows on the bed and for those who prefer, foam pillows in the closet. Lighting in the room was excellent. There was also a comfortable arm chair and ottoman. The room was quiet. The room and bathroom looked a bit old and dated.The room had a regular TV. Besides a good variety of broadcast and cable channels, the hotel offers a large selection of pay-per-view movies. The room has a good work desk and office-style chair. Under the TV were a mini refrigerator with sensors. In the closet there was an electronic safe.The bathrooms featured a tub/shower. Lighting is good. The Portico brand bath amenities are good quality and included: shampoo, conditioner, lotion, bath gel, and mouthwash. On the sink there is a coffee maker and hair dryer. The room was very clean and housekeeping was excellent during my stay. I had breakfast at lobby restaurant, my breakfast was good.There is small exercise facility which was crowed. For a hotel and seminar site of this size, the exericise facility is too small. The Grand Hyatt at Union Square has larger and better exercise faciity. Luckily the rain stopped after my first evening and I was able to go jogging up to Nob Hill and back every other day.  This property is located in the Embarcadero Center of office spaces and retail and food spaces. Though many of food offerings are limited during the weekend and in the evening since they cater to working crowd during the morning and lunch time. I ate at the nearby Buckhorn Cafe and Pho Vietnamese restaurants. Other evenings I walked to Chinatown for dinner.Union Square properties offer more food places to dine than the Hyatt Regency. I paid an conference rate of $215.00. The previous month at the Grand Hyatt on Union Square I paid special group rate of $140.00. So my biggest complaint is the price of this property.Breakfast &amp; Lunch during the Talent Summit &amp; Workshops was okay. The Summit provided to a good investment of time with kudos to Knowledge Infusion Pre-Conference workshop and speakers Marshall Goldsmith &amp; Patrick Leliconi and the Heidrick &amp; Struggles pitch. The post summit Linkage Talent Development workshop was good but not great.I highly recommend this property if you are able to get a rate of between $140 - $175.00. $215 plus is too high for this property.	
Nov 26 2007 	Overall nice but could be better for a 4* hotel	Relatively nice hotel with great location. The room was spacious and comfortable with a nice view on the Bay. The bathroom was a little bit outdated for a 4* hotel. The staff was friendly and helpful. However, the parking was very expensive ($55/day!). We were also disappointed with the room service (e.g. a yogurt in the breakfast we ordered in the room was expired since 2 weeks...). But overall it remained a quite pleasant experience.	
Nov 26 2007	Loved the hotel hated the noise	We booked this hotel and got a great price through Priceline- around $100 per night but then upgraded for another $30 for a view of the bayand breakfast. Because it was the holiday season the ice skating rink was up and running and even though we were 9 stories up it was very loud and the music didn't stop until 11:00. We had our 5 year old withus or we wouldn't have been back so early. I wouldn't recommend eatingthe hot buffet breakfast runny eggs, etc. I would stay again. The holiday decoration were nice in the lobby.	
Nov 25 2007 	55 bucks a night for parking at a four star hotel? They're insane.	While centrally located with an excellent view, as a priceline hotel this location makes no sense. You might GET the hotel room for 60 bucks a night, but the price for parking, FOR GUESTS, is an unheard of 55 dollars a night including tax. Moreover, internet service is both spotty AND expensive as their wifi will run you $9.99 a day. Overall, for one night, it's fine. Not great but fine. But if you DO go. Park across the street at the Embarcadero parking structure. There, the price is only 25 dollars a day for parking. Granted, there's a lovely lobby and it's located right by the cable cars. But there are plenty of VERY NICE three star hotels with free wifi and FREE parking. If you get this hotel on Priceline, good luck to you.	
Nov 25 2007 	Great Location Great Views	I've stayed twice at the Hyatt Embarcadero, most recently around Thanksgiving 2007 for 3 nights. This hotel has a breathtaking atrium which when decorated with holiday lights makes it look even better.I had reserved a room for about $150/night but I decided to upgrade to a room facing the bay on the 15th floor for an additional $30. My room was first class in every respect and the bed was great. There was a nice work desk where I could use my laptop (the WiFi cost an extra $10/day).The balcony afforded a nice view of the city and the bay. I didn't eat in the restaurant, the buffet breakfast was listed at $27 and I thought that was way too high. I did use the bar twice, it's also a little pricy ($10 for a glass of average white wine). They used to have a revolving restaurant/bar at the top which now seems to be closed, not sure if it's going to reopen.The location can't be beat as it is just steps to BART (which I took to and from the airport) and one of the cable car which has NO WAIT to get on, compared to the one on Powell where you have to wait 20-30 minutes to get on the cable car.One negative thing is that the hotel was built in the early 70s when concrete design was fashionable, and today that looks very dated (ugly). The balconies have a nice view but all the concrete surroundings puts you off and you don't feel like sitting out there, There are also a lot of birds that make a mess on the concrete.Still, I love this hotel and think it's worth every penny, it's not cheap but not expensive by San Francisco standards either.	
Nov 18 2007	Mixed Experience	We stayed at the Hyatt Regency for one night for $94 on Priceline. We were pretty happy with our stay but would have been quite upset if we had paid full price. There was some sort of construction going on at the hotel's entrance and it wasn't at all clear how to get up to the lobby area so we and several others had to mill around in a confused state for a few minutes before climbing up a broken escalator. We were upgraded to a room on a higher floor with a Bay view and breakfast for another $30 which was a good deal, as Sunday breakfast can be hard to come by in that area. The room itself was nice enough and we had no problems with the staff, who were all friendly and helpful, but one very odd, and to me inexcusable, thing was that there was no hotel bar open at 11:00 on a Saturday night. A private function was just finishing up at the hotel's bar, so that was not available. The cafe was supposed to be closed, but we saw a bar similar to what you would find at someone's house party in the cafe, and asked if we could buy a drink and take it somewhere else. The attendant said ok but had a really sad selection of wine - we're talking Robert Mondavi being the best one -- and for $10.00 per glass at that! Not to sound like an alcoholic, but what nice hotel doesn't have a fully functioning bar open on a Saturday night?The lobby itself is rather cold and anything but intimate. After sitting around with our drinks for a few minutes, we had no desire to stay there anymore, so gulped them down and went back up to our room.The hotel is well situated for public transportation and you can easily get to almost anywhere the average tourist would go. Next time if I want to stay in the area, I would rather stay at the Harbour Court down the street, which has a lot more charm than the Hyatt, which seems much more like a business hotel than a tourist hotel.	
Nov 18 2007 	Outdated and overpriced	My husband and I reserved the &quot;Regency Club City View&quot; package for originally 7 nights (but after booking changed to 3 nights), complete with views of the bay, private lounge access with breakfast, hors d'oeuvres and cocktails in the evenings, and supposedly very upscale decor and ammendments at ~$379 per night. We arrived late to check in our first night, as we had been traveling for approximately 24 hours that day. The host at the reception desk told us they had overbooked our room and that he would have to give us the last room available, but neglected to tell us it was a smoking room. Being nonsmokers we were extrememly disappointed and I demanded they get us another room or comp the room as we had booked a month in advance. He comped the room, and promised to give us his best room the next evening. We moved to the 16th floor, with a balcony, where we decided to have breakfast that morning. We left the balcony for 2 min and returned to find 200 pigeons pecking at our plates. Apparently one (or all 200) had gotten into the room, since I had found fresh pigeon droppings by the sliding door. So, I scanned the floor in the room and noticed that some droppings (dried and thus old ) had gone as far as the bathroon! This meant that the floor had not been cleaned or vaccuumed in quite a long time. I was completely disgusted-for $379 a night the room should have been sparkling clean. We will never stay at this hotel again.I should also mention the positive things (there are few)..the location was great, the staff was friendly, the continental breakfast was fresh and cocktail lounge was a nice touch in the evenings before going out on the town. The gym facilities were adequate and clean. Overall, not a clean, comfortable stay, and the decor and cleaning staff need to be updated and replaced. There are so many great hotels in San Francisco, this one should not be your first choice.	
Nov 15 2007 	Nothing special	I stayed at the Hyatt Regency at the Embarcadero center for a conference at the end of October and found the place overpriced for what it offers. The room was ok but, as many of these chain hotels, this one too should renew the bathrooms replacing the old rusted baths with efficient showers. Also, there was just one restaurant inside the hotel, and thought it was not very busy, it took ages to get the check after the meal. The front desk staff was disastrous: we were sharing the room and it took three printouts to get the receipts right (they kept mixing up names and addresses). The location though is good, just opposite a Bart-Muni station and close to the Ferry Building, and within walking distance from Union Square.	
Nov 14 2007 	Great Stay at Hyatt	I booked a Regency Club room, wanting the breakfast and afternoon snack/cocktails that came with it. I also wanted a balcony room, but that was not in my budget. When I checked in, Lisa at the front desk upgraded me to a balcony room with Regency Club perks at no extra charge! Had I originally booked this sort of room it would have cost $20/night extra. Very nice touch!The room was spacious, great bed, bathroom &amp; dressing area. The balcony overlooked the ice skating at the Embarcadero and I had a view of Coit Tower and the bay. Couldn't ask for more.I'm a coffee lover and Starbucks was provided all day, just pour yourself one on the Regency Club level area (16th floor). The breakfast was mostly breads, breakfast rolls, cereals, fresh fruit and cold cuts. All very nicely displayed with helpful personnel offering trays if you wanted to eat back in your room.Housekeeping was quick and efficient - even though on my last day they knocked on my door 3 times to see if I had left. I asked for extra time in the room and it was granted.The hotel is in a great spot - right next to the BART subway system, the MUNI light rail and busses. They were decorating the atrium for Christmas and white lights were hung from the various floors - a beautiful effect! The tree took 3 days to get up and it was beautiful.Every employee I passed in the hall said hello or good morning/afternoon/evening.This was my 2nd stay at this hotel and I will come back again.	
Nov 12 2007 	LOVE them. LOVE!	I love this place! We thought we booked a room w/ a balcony (for my husband and I it is a MUST have!) and while there was an error the manager found us a room right away AND they arranged a bottle of wine and cookies for our anniversary.. And then there is the location. If you can arrange to get there w/o a car you'll be happy!	
Nov 1 2007 	Nice stay	Many have given mixed reviews to this property. My wife and I enjoyed it quite a bit. My wife stay in SF a lot. Mostly at the Grand Hyatt. This was here first stay at the Regency and she was quite impressed. Very quiet room and even w/ balcony door open(for a large city). We missed the sax music. Yes, a balcony w/ two chairs and a table. We stayed on a Regency Club floor, 16 out of 17. Nice morning and evening refreshments. It is crazy to not join hotels frequent stay clubs even if you only travel a little. The location was great for shopping at Union Square. And was directly across from the Ferry building. My wife will stay there in the future and I know I want to go back too. Clean rooms and building. Nice, helpful staff. We arrived by plane, took the BART from the airport and ended up at the door of the hotel. A car in SF is not my idea of a good time and valet parking is only one of my concerns.	
Oct 29 2007 	Great Stay and easy to get to.	The hotel's location is easy to get to, it's at the embarcadero station (bart, muni etc.). Rooms are clean and even though our room was stuck in a tiny corner of the hotel is was quite. No problems with staff. This is a good choice for people who've been SF a couple of times and don't want to see Union Square and Pier 39, though they are easy to get to from the hotel's location. Muni's light rail is across the street at the Ferry building, and bart's on the corner. Would stay there again, no problems at all during my trip.	
Oct 29 2007	Nice Hotel	Good property in a city with many good hotels. Convenient to public transportation (cable car, street car, bus, or Bart), so you can easily get anywhere in the city - no car necessary. Staff very efficient. Nice views/location. Ferry Terminal nearby has good shops and foods.	
Sep 6 2007 	the sax is good and bad	My fiance and I stayed here for his birthday. The room itself was clean and the view of the bay was very nice. The location was so-so but we were close to one of our now favorite restaurants. The hotel lobby and general decor could use a facelift. Compared to other four star hotels in the city, this hotel does not measure up. Our one complaint does not arise from the hotel itself, but from the surrounding area involving a ruthless saxophone player. The music echoed and made the street musician seem like he was in our room! We arrived at the hotel around 7PM and the saxophone music, which included Jingle Bells, continued well into the night. In the morning, we were unpleasantly awoken at approximately 9AM by the Kenny G flunkee. We did not receive a restful morning due to the unknown male who needs his musical instrument seized by force if necessary.	
Sep 4 2007	Excellent room but go elsewhere to eat	Stayed last 4 days in August on business trip. Location is excellent - central to shopping/eating/attractions. Checking in/out was very quick and courteous. The foyer is very impressive. Got Kingsize room on second floor (quiet for a second floor) - very good sized room. Nice view over Bay area. Room spotless. Had tea making facilities and lots of tv channels. The minibar was very large but quite expensive - 4USD for a bottle of water . I would recommend calling help-desk for wireless internet connectivity. My European bank called at 4am to notify me of uncharacteristic authorizations on my credit card - this was caused by me trying to pay for wireless access through their site and repeatedly telling me that my card was declined when in fact authorizations were put through. I then had problems trying to get an outgoing connection from the hotel phone to stop my bank from freezing my card but eventually it was resolved.Breakfast is not cheap at 26USD (+tip) for the buffet. Unless you've got an huge appetite, I would recommend ordering off the menu or going elsewhere.I had dinner on one evening - fillet steak - although reasonably priced, it was quite bland and there were only about 4 other people in a sizable dining area (the chicken starter was quite poor). San Fran has some great places to eat so do not eat dinner in the hotel.I didn't use the gym facilities but take a walk around hilly San Fran with it's spectacular views and you won't need any other exercise.For business trips, I would recommend the Hyatt but might be a bit pricey for a vacation.	
Sep 3 2007 	Nice stay	We have just returned from a short stay at the Hyatt Regency San Francisco. The hotel lobby is amanzing and the rooms are very confortable . The location is good with good acess by public transportation! Didn´t try the restaurants . Overall I would say this is a good hotel	
Aug 26 2007 	Not great for a Hyatt	The bad:The room we stayed in had spots on the carpet, black mold by the tub and red/orange mold dots in the bathroom ceiling.The room was non-smoking in theory but we had to sleep with the window open with all the street noise in order to get the smell out.The hot water pressure was weak in the shower.No robes.Could hear people in room above walking about.Front desk was not very motivated to help us change rooms. The good:The beds were very nice.Had tube TV, clock radio, extra synthetic pillow, cosmetic mirror, coffe maker, hair dryer and iron.Conclusion:Guess this hotel would be ok if it was updated. Not sure about the open lobby design unless they had sound proof doors.	
Aug 25 2007 	Great Hotel Great Location	We decided to stay at this hotel after previously staying in Fishermans Wharf and this is a much better location - so much mroe central and if you do their park and play package which comes with breakfast and free parking all the better.Having a car in San Fran makes the world of difference - our previous trips we were reliant on taxis and walking - which was not so bad but to get off the beaten track and see some amazing parts of SF def get a car!The hotel concierge team were great at ensuring we had maps and info.The breakfasts were fine for the included price and they always took great care of our 3 year old.The only complaint we had was the room next door was full of College students who decided to party from 1am until 6am - not great for us at all. Told the hotel who offered us free breakfast but that didn't mean much to us as we were already having breakfasts included. All in all I would recommend this hotel to all sorts of groups!	
Aug 24 2007	Stingy x 10	I was shocked to hear that the valet parking was $50+ a day! Even though San Francisco has little parking, this rate is outrageous. Not only that, but they charged internet, which has been free for nearly every hotel I've stayed in. Because the summer there was very chilly (like Mark Twain said), I wanted to swim indoors, but the hotel does not have a swimming pool. The Em barcadero center that the hotel is in not bad. The restaurants in the center are an excellent spot for lunch with choices ranging from classic deli sandwhiches to pizza to sushi and there are plenty of hungry pigeons to feed. I would recommend this hotel strictly for business people that will have their expenses paid. The environment at the is good for a conference, maybe not a family trip.	
Aug 24 2007 	Great location average hotel	Spent one night at the Hyatt and, while I loved the location, I was not so pleased with the hotel itself. I booked a room on one of the &quot;Business Plan&quot; floors, thinking this might be a little nicer than average. My mistake. What I got was a room on a floor just like all the others, except I had to swipe my key card in the elevator to punch my floor's button. Before I arrived, the hotel sent me an e-mail from the &quot;E-Concierge&quot; offering a variety of services for free and for extra cost. I responded by asking for extra towels and the New York Times, but got neither. The hotel is huge and built during the era of the giant interior courtyard (much like the Marriott Marquis in New York City). The now-dated interior is dark and damp (a stream runs through the lobby, which is probably the moisture source). The corridors are narrow and dark. The room itself is a bit dated and the bathroom is small. Mold was present on the seam between the tub and the wall. Given the cost of the room, I expected better.	
Aug 6 2007 	Very Nice standard Hyatt fair	Hotel was very nice. We had a semi corner room that could see the bay bridge. Ammenities were all there and standard fair for a upscale business hotel. One downside however was the rotating restaurant. Wasn't really worth it for the price and the wall was a tad dirty, so ever full rotation, we would see that black smudge on the wall. There are so many great restaurants in SF that I would recommend that you look elsewhere for either drinks or food. The bar downstairs in the lobby was also a bit wanting. Not too many people, and tried to be a little too hip for what it really was, a lobby bar.	
Jul 29 2007 	Nice but parking blows	The hotel was very nice and clean. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. It is in good location to transit stops that will take you either to Fisherman's Wharf or Union Square. Parking however should be budgeted into your trip. The hotel's valet parking is 50 dollars a day plus tips. The parking at the 3 Embarcadero building is 30 dollars a day if you never remove your car. I'm unsure if this is normal for San Fran. Just make sure to budget parking into your hotel stay.	
Jul 29 2007	Best hotel experience in SF	We were pleasantly surprised to get a room at the Hyatt through Priceline for a bid that was less than have the advertised rate. Then at check-in they offered to upgrade us to a bayside view for $35. Best money I've ever spent. We got a 15th floor king with a balcony and a gorgeous view of the Bay. The room was impeccable and the hotel staff was helpful and courteous almost to a fault. It was by far the best experience I've had at any hotel in San Francisco or elsewhere in many years.	
Jul 19 2007 	Excellent - Well Worth it	The hotel was my safe haven after a nightmare overnight stay in another hotel in Union Square. The Hyatt saved my trip to SFO. I would recommend that you opt for the business plan if you have the option for the few extra bucks you have an excellent breakfast down in the restaurant. The food is excellent. The concierge was extremely helpful in helping me plan my day and night excursions around SF. They helped me book a city tour (well worth the money) and a helicopter ride (highly recommend). The bell staff was also very kind and respectful. They will hold your luggage in a locked room while you wait for transportation to the airport or want walk around the city before you leave. Right outside the hotel you can get on a trolley car that takes you up to Union Square. The hotels backdoors lead you right to the Market Terminal. If you want to be away from the Wharf and dont mind the expense of the hotel, I recommend this hotel. The room was very spacious as well as the bathroom. The balcony overlooked the water sculptor display and the bay. I was able to watch the parade of tall ships. The noise at night is very little. You can sleep with your balcony door open (dont recommend it  pigeons).	
Jul 17 2007 	Wow!!! Just Amazing	We got a great deal through AAA. Hotel and free breakfast buffet for $200. As soon as we pulled up we were greeted with great service and of course a smile. Checking in was fantastic and wow the Lobby was just spectacular. We didnt have a view of the bay, but I wasnt dissapointed as the hotel room was just amazing. The king size bed with six pillows was very comfy. The best night sleep I had ever had at a hotel. The buffet breakfast was a little small, but I am not complaining when it comes to free. Only thing was the Concierge desk had us call around for Alcatraz tickets. I thought that that is what a Concierge is for. I will stay here again, and have already recommended this hotel... Four Star all the way...	
Jul 15 2007 	Nice place very expensive	Huge hotel in a great location. Nice room, spacious with great view of the Ferry Buillding. They charge you for EVERYTHING! Internet is $10 a day. Parking is $50 a day. Room service and in hotel dining are UNREAL! The real kicker is the mini bar. We usually bring water and milk to put in the mini bar. Here's what happened, we opened the door and started to take out the contents and noticed a small label in the fridge. The label warned you that the contents were AUTOMATICALLY added to your bill as soon as they were removed from the fridge by sensors in the fridge. Once removed it's yours. If you want them to remove the contents so you can use the fridge it will cost you $20!!!!! Although a pleasant stay we will not stay on our next trip in three weeks. There are other hotels in the area that don't rob you as blatantly as the Hyatt. Oh, and one other problem is the elevators. Tourists not staying in the hotel come to ride the elevators to see the atrium. They wait in the elevators until someone with a keycard enters and they ride them up and down like they're at Disneyland. Got very annoying after a couple days.	
Jul 1 2007 	Just so so for Hyatt-nothing special	I stayed at the Hyatt Embarcadero Wed. June 6 - Fri. June 8th on business for a conference rate of $200 (much less than the lowest $350 AAA rate I could find) booked through a special website. I must say that the hotel is large hotel with nice atrium in the middle with checkin on the second flor of the hotel with conference rooms on first level and below - setup is little strange. Strange meaning bars and main resturant on the same second level as checkin/registration desk and open air with rooms all facing inward. Very easy to get to from OAK airport using AirBART ($3 exact change each way) and BART train ($3.35 each way exact change or credit at tix machine) to the Embarcadero station stop. Now, on with my review.....Checkin was breeaze with many checkin agents available, however not easy to switch rooms - at least for my conference and I am Platinum Passport level, so I was stuck with a third floor on the Market St. side standard room, and got to listen to the Market St buses idle all day &amp; night, and saxophone musicians play the Godfather theme every single morning on the street at the crack of dawn.Pros:Early checkin was availableCan view hotel bill on room tvComfy beds with insulated walls- you do not hear your neighborsLarge tv's in roomiron and board in roomGood water pressure/hot water all timesClose to many restaurants for nice luches and dinners outCable line begins and ends right in front of hotelEasy to get a cab7-11 convenience store right across street for main entrance for snacks, water, gum, etc.Starbucks directly across the street right next to the 7-11 cstoreFast elevetorsPlentiful elevators - 6 if I remember correctly10-15 minute walk to Union SquareSafe area to walk at nightLate checkout provided at checkinCons:Expensive roomsMaid came in room even when I put privacy card on door - luckily I was clothed and working at the deskinernet access is $10 a day - 24 hour time begins when you activateExpensive to drink and eat in hotel - better to walk to other places in areaRooms are small for a Hyatt and the moneyStaff not very friendly but efficientBilling errors - I was charge for movies I did not order every nigh of my stay, but was corrected easily at front desk.Lower floor rooms are very noisy through the window side of roomBar was always closed - never any staff available in bar (many guests were complaining about bar being closed including some visitors meeting guests) NOTE: Bar on top floor of this hotel closed permanently at end of May.Parking-Not sure about parking since I would not rent a car in SF unless paning to go out to wine country, but saw a logjam in front of hotel with some guests irriated in tie it took to get thier cars fro valet. I think hotel may be valet only also ( $30 - $50 per day and no in/out priviledges)Lunch and dinner hotel food was not very good. Bfast was great.Recommendations:Stay somewhere else in Union Square area like the Westin for equal level of hotel rating or the Le Meridien near this Hyatt Emb.Get a room on the highest floor possible above street noiseDo not get a room on the Market St side ) I believe room #'s that end in 01 - 12 are on that street. I was in Room # 308 which was not good due to street noiseCheck your bill - mine had errorsAvoid breakfast in the hotel, great bfast food but pricey ($40 for buffet for one person) - Go to Max's Diner one block off Union Square for breakfast connected to the Maxwell Hotel (another review for me) on Geary St. insteadwhich is a 15 minute walk but worth it.Bring ear plugsLunch and dinner food in hotelI would not stay at this Hyatt again for business or personal travel.That's all.	
Jun 21 2007 	Location 	If you want conveinence then this is your place. BART, Muni &amp; Trolley car right outside the door. Also the Ferry Bldg is across the street with plenty of food. There is a shopping &amp; restaurant area next to the bldg so you can find clothing if you need and places to eat. The rooms are nicely decorated, updated and clean. The rooms are quiet, no thin walls here. Ask for a room on the Bay side and you will be rewarded with amazing views. The Bay Bridge is out your window. We were engaged in SF 14 years ago and came back to eat at the same restaurant. We had the concierge set up the reservation. When we came back to our room, there was champagne, strawberries as well as cookies &amp; milk for our kids! That was a special touch and it won't be forgotten. Steve at the concierge desk is awesome! All the staff was very friendly and helpful there was no snobby pretension here. It was pricier than some of the other chain hotels and cheaper than a Ritz but well worth it for a memorable stay. Also, if you are looking for a quiet place to eat breakfast - take BART to Union Square and walk to O'Farrell st. Santorini restaurant serves an amazing breakfast. We were there on a weekday about 9 am. We had the place to ourselves and the food was incredible. Happy travels!	
Jun 13 2007 	Nice hotel for one so large	What a great property - it's in great shape and the atrium is impressive. If you can, get a room with a balcony facing the harbor - I lucked out.The staff, when encountered was professional and courteous at every turn. The concierges know all the restaurants and provided two fabulous recommendations while we were there.The only knocks I give it are the following:1. the gym is way too small for a hotel with that many rooms. Definitely need bigger.2. the exhibit and conference space is converted from an old garage, so the ceilings are rather low in those areas.This hotel serves the Hyatt brand well.	
Jun 2 2007 	Perfect stay!	It was my second stay there and it was, as always, very good. The staff was perfect, very available for you, the room was also very good. If you have 30$ more to spend in the room with a balcony do it because its much quiet with a view on the bay than on the street, but you dont hear a lot of noise from outside in a room with a downtown view. You can get a very good price for this hotel via sites like hotwire and it is a very good value!	
Jun 1 2007	Large hotel in a great location	This Hyatt is popular with large business groups and conventioneers, but it can be a nice hotel for tourists too. The lobby includes the trademark soaring atrium and a mediocre coffee shop, along with a decent bar. Rooms are small, and some are exposed to a lot of street noise, but some have great views toward the bay and/or bay bridge. The decor is a bit dated and could use an upgrade.I've stayed here several times in the past few years, and service has always been professional and compassionate.The location is great. It's right across from Foodie Heaven, the Ferry Building. An excellent breakfast, lunch, dinner, or snack is just a short walk away. A BART (subway) stop is located directly in front on Market Street, and Yerba Buena Center or Union Sq are flat 15-minute walks away. Toward the Ferry Building, a vintage street car can transport you to the Fisherman's Wharf area, while a hilly walk in the other direction will take you to China Town or North Beach.Parking will cost you a small fortune (at last check I think it was over $40 a night).	
May 30 2007 	The big Atrium hotel	The atrium is the centerpiece in this hotel. Several years old now, it's still beautiful architecture. The rooms are OK - nothing fancy for this class of hotel. And the facitity feels a bit dated (some of the concrete walls don't do much for me). But the sliding doors on the room added a wonderful openness to the room and the view was pretty good. The location is good, and the F trolly line, BART and MUNI right at the hotel will get you everywhere. It's a good hotel but I wouldn't pay a premium.	
May 30 2007 	Comfortable stay very convenient!	We're usually drawn by cozy, offbeat hotels, but we needed to book a room in SF with a week's notice and all the 'cozy' hotels were either too expensive or on the 'seedy' side of 'cozy'! So we gave Priceline a shot, and scored a room at the Hyatt Embarcadero at a good rate -- $92 per night. Positives: Proximity to the BART station -- you can't beat it. The BART train goes directly from the airport to the hotel and takes about 25 minutes... the Embarcadero BART station is literally next to the hotel's front door. Close to the California streetcar line and not a bad walk to the touristy Fisherman's Wharf area if you're into that....Comfort....the room/bed were very comfortable and clean -- we had a view of the harbor.Location for great, convenient food: don't miss the Ferry Building across the street for really good food...there's also a huge farmer's market on Saturday mornings. Drawbacks: Not many -- it's a long hike around to your room if you're on the opposite side from the elevators, but that's not really a big deal.Also, it's not super-close (at least not walkable) to restaurant areas, and things seemed to close down super-early in that neighborhood (we had trouble finding a reasonably-priced meal nearby at 9:30).All in all, though, we were very happy with our stay, especially at the price we paid!	
May 28 2007 	Excellent! You won't be disappointed.	Arrived Saturday of Memorial Day weekend for a 2 night stay. Picked the room up for $84 a night on Priceline, about 1/3 of the going rate. The location of the hotel is perfect, next to Embarcadero Bart station, Powell / Hyde Cable Car line and SF Muni bus terminal. Walking distance to Chinatown, Columbus Street (Little Italy). Took Muni to AT&amp;T Park for a Giants game. All very simple from this location. Check-in was simple, room was spacious and clean witha great view (7th Floor). In fact, room was oversized and beautiful with excellent furnishings. We skipped the $50 a day parking fee and found a lot a few blocks away for $11 (Jackson &amp; Sansome Streets). Starbucks across the street too. Excellent shopping in Embarcadero area next door. Simply no complaints at all! Excellent and we would stay again.	
May 23 2007 	Overpriced	Yes, the Hyatt Regency has an impressive atrium. By definition, however, an atrium is empty space. The hotel itself was disappointing. In my room, the sink faucets did not work; neither did the overhead fan. The hotel did not feature any free wireless or Internet connection. Breakfasts were astonishingly expensive. Given what I paid, the experience was disappointing.	
May 18 2007 	Nice enough no SF charm	I've stayed at this hotel a few times for fun and business. I never intentionally pick it, it is always a Hotwire/Priceline pick for 4-star hotel in the Embarcadero. It is a nice enough hotel, the rooms are comfy and big, the view is always beautiful, and the staff is friendly. The location can't be beat, right on the water, near the ferry terminal and the BART stop. We were upgraded for free to the club level and got free drinks/snacks and breakfast. Not bad! If you want a real, unique SF hotel experience this is not the place, rather corporate. But if you like consistency, this is a great place!	
May 17 2007	Great Hotel- Perfect Location	Just returned from another perfect stay at the Hyatt Regency SF, 5 Embarcadero Center in San Francisco-This is a perfect hotel as the Bart system brings you right to the entrance and only cost $5.15 one way per/person to get to from the SF airport-This is our 3rd stay at this hotel and it is consistantly clean, well maintained..and has an impecable staff.Everyone from check in to check out went out of their way to make sure our stay was nothing less than Perfect. The rooms are most spacious, impecablly clean and the beds are sooo comfortable- We had breakfast each morning and the watiers/bus boys were all so accomodating..which made this a great experience.This hotel is located right on the cable car system and the electric trolleys are easy to access as well-It is right across the street from the Ferry Bldg which is a must see-You will not be disappointed with a stay at this Hyatt Regency-	
May 15 2007	Very convenient location	We got this hotel for a great price, so always very nice! It was incredibly convenient in terms of getting to and from the airport. Not so much party central, so maybe next time I'd stay in Union Square. Room was clean, mostly well kept. I had a great view, which I found kind of surprising because we booked through Priceline and I've heard that you get the lousiest room that way. But not here! We were able to check in a few hours before the stated time. The bar downstairs has good prices for a cocktail before dinner.	
May 7 2007	Nice hotel in great location	We stayed at this property for four nights when we were attending a trade show. We were pleased with the room. It was nicely furnished and the bed was very comfortable, with a firm mattress, lots of pillows, and a down comforter. (At least it felt like a down comforter.) I've stayed in expensive hotels that had those flimsy blankets that you can buy at Walmart for $10, so I was impressed with the bedding. The concierge was very helpful with giving directions and other information, and there is a dedicated computer near the front desk where you can print your airline boarding passes for free. I was astounded at the parking rates (on a par with New York City) but luckily we didn't have a car. Internet access in your room is $10 per 24 hours, which is standard in many hotels, although I think expensive hotels such as this one should give it to you for free.The hotel is in an extremely convenient location. The metro stop is literally outside the front door, the bus and trolley stop are down the block (beware the trolley that is right outside the hotel; it's not a regular trolley but a tourist trolley that costs $5) and the ferry is a few blocks away. You can walk to a lot of shopping and restaurants, and there's a Starbucks across the street. The area isn't very busy at night, so be alert if you're walking. We were lucky to get this hotel on Priceline. I probably would pay full price to stay here if I could afford it.	
May 7 2007 	Great!	Used Priceline and got this for a total of $93 per night (including taxes). GREAT property for the money and RIGHT at the Embarcadero BART stop. If you are flying in and out of SFO just take the BART (San Fran subway and it is $3.95 each way). The hotel was beyond wonderful as far as niceness goes (for the money). I am pretty picky and they upgraded me to a fabulous regency suite (which was grandiose in style, view, and amenities).I also met the love of my life at this property, so it will always be a VERY special place to me.Take care and I hope that everyone loves this place as much as I did!!	
May 2 2007 	Excellent view and great location	definately worth the $30 upcharge for a bay view. The room was more than adequate and the view was incredible. We also stayed at the Omni in San Fran which was very nice, but I would rather stay at the Hyatt because of the view and prime location.	
Apr 29 2007 	Dont Hesitate ! Its Awesome ! From A Calfornia Girl Born and Raised...	Awesome Stay at the Hyatt.. We took BART over for the International Beer Festival At Fort Mason ! Booked our room online directly though Hyatt.. We didnt have to park our car so that saves about 45.00 a day ! All I can say is we were on the 15th FLOOR and WHAT a fantastic ROOM... Wonderful View HUGE room ! King size Bed was wonderful !!! Service was A +++++++ Would stay there in a heartbeat !!!!!! Right across from the Ferry Building and Centrally Located ! Cant wait to go again !!!	
Apr 29 2007 	Nice Hotel Great Location	We stayed here after getting a great $75 deal on priceline. The hotel is in a nice area, close to transportation with great views of the bay. The place is a little cold and impersonal, this is NOT a botique hotel. However, the rooms were clean, updated and well worth the price. The staff was attentive and helpful. Don't eat here as it is priced sky high. There are many nice places to eat very close so venture out and see the city. (Parking is $50 per night..FYI)	
Apr 29 2007 	great stay	received excellent service while there. no coffee in room. Glad we paid 60 per nite priceline. For a 4star hotel. no robes in room or free coffee. But location is excellent. Close to transportation. cable cars, trolleys, and trains. Close to everystore you can think of . Walking distance to so many places. We had starbucks coffee every morning across street and there is a little pastry coffee shop that sells rolls with scrambled eggs and ham for $3.00. Very reasonable to eat there. We were walking distance to ferry terminal where they have a farmers market tusday and weekends. Food in the terminal is fabulous and reasonable. You can pick up a bottle of wine, cheese fruit bread and they have an italian deli to pick up fresh cold cuts and subs. We were very happy to be there. the hotel itself is beautiful. Staff friendly. Main entrance is on 2nd floor be warned. Its a bit of a hike. Slept like a baby in the beds provided. We were given a view of the baybridge. We were able to open our window and look out . Beautiful. Recommend it.	
Apr 21 2007 	overrated and overpriced	My husband and I stayed here during a month-long trip all over the U.S. Honestly, we were underwhelmed. On the postive, the bed was amazingly comfortable and we got the best night's sleep of our trip. The view from the room was great, as was the location in SF.However, we have had better service at budget hotels. On our first night at the Hyatt, we went down to the lobby bar for some drinks and appetizers. The bar was VERY quiet- there were only a few tables occupied. Despite the fact that it was slow, and the fact that there were 5 (yes, 5) servers working at the time, it took 15 minutes for someone to come and take our order. Then, it took another 20 minutes for the waitress to bring us our drinks. When we looked up to see what was taking so long, we saw all the servers and bartender standing around talking. Our food came about 40 minutes after we ordered it. Nobody offered us any explanation of why things were taking so long.My husband works in the restaurant and hotel industry, so we are very understanding with waitstaff when we go out. But this was ridiculous- the service was absolutely appalling. On top of all that, it cost $50 per day to park our car at the hotel, and another $10 per day to use the internet. I understand that the parking rate is pretty typical for an upscale hotel in the city, but why are they charging for internet??? I can go to a La Quinta and get it for free!! As lovely as the accommodations are, the inflated cost of this hotel is not justified due to the below average customer service.	
Apr 14 2007 	Great hotel amazing service	I stayed at the Hyatt at the Embarcadero for a combined work and vaction trip. I booked a business rate room that I think was about $135 - a steal for that location and the fact it included the continental breakfast buffet.The room was average size, but with those great Hyatt beds. The bathroom was small, but the vanity was outside which made that less of a problem. There were two work areas and the wireless worked well at each - which is not always the case in older hotels. It was nice to have a second table near the door so I could work at night when my son was sleeping.The best things about this hotel:- location: right across from the ferry terminal where one can catch ferries, tolley cars, buses to anywhere in the city. Also the cable car line and the underground also stop right at the hotel. I can not think of another hotel I have stayed at that had such good connections to public transit. There is great shopping right next door, wonderful restaurants within blocks, a street market a couple days a week acroos the street. Walgreens and Starbucks across the street was convenient too.- service: the hotel staff, particularily the concierge staff were amazing. Some of our luggage did not arrive with us and the staff was great about helping with the airlines to find it. - business center was above average. There was no charge for use of the computer or printer. They shipped packages back to my office and tracked incoming couriers willingly.	
Mar 31 2007 	Good not great stay	Pluses: Great location on the Embarcadero for a 3-night stay. Cable car and Muni right outside the door. Room was clean and comfortable. Balcony with sliding door and view of bay a pleasant surprise. Many great restaurants nearby.Minuses: Lots of cement in this dark, monolithic building, not warm or inviting. Staff reflects this - capable but terse, not particularly warm. In room guest services guide omits important details. Outrageous food prices in room service and atrium restaurant, even for a pricey city like SF. Tired breakfast buffet with limited offerings runs a staggering $26. At $228/night including taxes, there are better values in SF. But the location is hard to beat.	
Mar 10 2007 	Happy Home at the Hyatt	Generally I prefer boutique hotels to large corporate chains, but desiring a low rate at a 4-star hotel in the Embarcadero area, I took a chance on Hotwire and landed the Hyatt Regency. Although its imposing facade and cavernous interior atrium are somewhat bizarre, the room was overall terrific and our views out to the Bay Bridge and over the Ferry Plaza and Union Pacific buildings were great. (The desk also offered an option to upgrade to a Bay view balcony froom for $30/night.) The &quot;Grand&quot; bed was super comfy, with great linens. The only downside, (no pun intended) was that it was too warm under the duvet without the window open and too noisy (even on the 9th floor) with it open. The heat did not seem to be able to be turned completely off --- all too common in big city hotels. Otherwise, the room was extremely pleasant. The location was marvelous; we loved the huge Saturday morning farmers' market at the ferry terminal below us---get breakfast there if you can. The ferry building also houses excellent restaurants and shops. Transport options around the city, to the airport and to ferries are right out the Hyatt's door. As others have mentioned, if you are minding your budget, be aware that if you need parking, Internet access and/or minibar service, you will be paying a premium price that will negate any bargain room rate. For our needs, the Hyatt Regency made a lovely upscale nest in San Francisco.	
Feb 2 2007 	Lovely hotel	Stayed here for a business conference. Gorgeous facility with excellent conference center. The restaurants were nice with good food and the front desk service was ok. Very sizeable rooms and my room had a decent view of the bay. The only fault I had was the service to and from the room. Average at best. I wanted to get a late night snack and it took forever (even though it was only 10)Otherwise, a wonderful stay.	
Jan 3 2007 	Great as usual!	Stayed at this HR a few days before Xmas. The holiday decorations were gorgeous. We had a beautiful room with a room of the bay. Great location and a-one service. The ice skating rink right outside added that extra Xmas touch. And being right across the street from the Ferry Building is a bonus too. Great place for coffee and breakfast.My only complaint is the $48 a day parking. Ouch! There is a much more reasonable parking garage down the street if you do not want to pay this exorbitant price. SF parking is always expensive but this is really RIDICULOUS!Otherwise, I will be back again. But I won't use their parking again...thats for sure.	
Dec 25 2006 	Great Hotel	This hotel is great! The beds were good. The breakfast was Excellent! The price was cheap.	
Dec 23 2006 	Great Central location - comfortable	We stayed 3 nights at this hotel after flying in from Australia and recuperated from the flight well. The room was aged, but clean and well maintained, the beds were great.  Location of this hotel was great, the view excellent (water view) - Hyatt Guest room - accommodated 3 of us comfortably.Front line staff were a bit reluctant (may have been the Aussie accent). Breakfast was ordinary - better options around town that cost less.The location of the hotel allowed us to either walk or catch trams to explore San Francisco. We felt this was a good area and felt safe.If you're looking for a centrally located, comfortable and clean hotel then I'd recommend this hotel and we'd stay again.	
Dec 14 2006 	Some nice features good location	I stayed here for one night last weekend and got a corporate rate for the room, which made it affordable; I'm glad I didn't pay full price for it. The location is excellent, right outside the BART station and close to the Ferry Building (awesome bars, restaurants, and fabulous farmer's market on Saturday mornings) as well as part of the Embarcadero shopping complex. The hotel is massive, with one of those cheezy big-hotel atriums in the centre, although since it was Christmas it was decorated for the holidays and quite beautiful. I arrived late on Friday night after missing a flight; the front desk staff was efficient, but not friendly. I decided to work out, and the gym was quite good - it's open 24 hours with your key and I was the only one there. The room itself was fine, although the bathroom was TINY, and the walls were paper-thin (I could hear the women in the next room chatting as soon as they woke up, which was EARLY!) Not what you expect from an expensive hotel. Average furnishings &amp; decor, but a nice big bed with soft sheets and lots of pillows, and a sliding door that opened to the outside, which was nice. Overall, a good but not great experience; I expected more considering what they normally charge for a room.	
Nov 27 2006 	Really Liked!	My husband and I stayed at the Hyatt Regency Embarcadero on Nov. 19-21, 2006. We booked the hotel through priceline.com and got a rate of $80. I knew a hotel in this area would charge for parking so I figured that was a pretty good rate if I added in an estimated parking fee of $30. It turned out that the parking fee was $28.50 if we self-parked with no in-out priveleges and $49 if we valet parked, inc. in-out priveleges. This was told to us by the valet at the hotel when we drove up. We truly appreciated his candor and decided to self park since we expected to use the local transportation. The parking garage was just across the street and the next block over so it was not a problem. We requested and received a king size, non-smoking room with a &quot;partial view&quot;. It was on the 7th floor and we could see the Ferry Building and bay beyond it. There was also an outside ice skating rink behind the hotel that we could see. Our room was large, one of the largest hotel rooms I have been in. The bed was extremely comfortable. The bathroom was clean.Since we arrived at midnight, we did not know about the water wall in the lobby until the morning. The lobby was just as pretty during the day. The hotel had just been decorated for Christmas and the lobby was quite pretty with all of the hanging lights. The hotel is located across the street from the Ferry Building and the &quot;F&quot; Line stops in front of it. This street car takes you all along the Embarcadero to Fisherman's Wharf and then down to Market Street. There is also a trolley car line that runs in front of the hotel that goes to Chinatown. Hotel staff was very knowledgeable and there is a computer kiosk where you can print your airline boarding passes.I would absolutely stay here again.	
Nov 19 2006 	Nice Hotel So So Location	I recently spent the night at the Hyatt Regency Embarcadero for a business conference. The actual hotel was beautiful, the rooms very comfortable, and the staff very friendly and helpful. I just wasn't very happy with the location. I usually enjoy shopping while in San Francisco. It is located next door to the Embarcadero Shopping Center, but there were only a few shops that I was interested in. The one advantage is there is a cable car stop right outside of the hotel that can take you to ChinaTown and over by Union Square.	
Oct 13 2006 	Loved the Hyatt	Have stayed at this hotel many times in the past. The hotel has an indoor feel inside the atrium and an airy feel once inside youre room. The hotel staff are and have always been nice, friendly and accomodating. Requested extra towels, bathroom amenities, room service, robe and was done-given accordingly. Never had any problem with them. This hotel now has their signature grand bed in ( some?) their guestrooms, I stayed on room 715, a little on the noisy side, ( 7th flr ) normally get a higher, bay / balcony view. If you happened to have drinks and dine at 13 Views, ask for Bonnie, shes very nice and friendly.Enjoy.	
Oct 6 2006 	Give it a try ! Not as bad as the reviews make it seem.	I read the other reviews by prior visits and was very concerned. So in effect my expectations were lowered a bit. But I was suprised. Yes, when it was built it was a showplace of the period. I loved looking at the architecture as the build had to be difficult. So I saw something different then others. The room was comfortable and in good shape, had a water for view and a balcony. Room service was ok. Nothing to write home about but I did not starve either. The bath was smaller than some hotels these days but not to small to worry about touching the shower curtain :) I would stay again.	
Oct 6 2006 	Spectacular Views	This was our first experience using Priceline and were very hesitant as to what we would get for the price we selected. WOW were we surprised and delighted. This hotel is fabulous in every respect but most particularly the view from the room: Oakland Bay Bridge and the Embarcadero. The location to the financial district makes it an excellent business hotel but it is walking distance to many wonderful areas for leisure travel.The only negative is the parking at $43 a night, discounted for hotel guests!	
Oct 5 2006	Good for business trips	I have stayed at this hotel for several business meetings. The hotel has a nice atrium court with a cafe, bar and small market. The cable cars are right out outside of the lobby entrance and most rooms have unobstructed views of the San Francisco bay. This hotel is great for conferences, but I wouldn't stay here for a romantic weekend. The rooms are somewhat bland and there are better hotels in SF with more character (Mark Hopkins, Ritz, Orchard).	
Sep 19 2006 	Loved it!	I took my wife to San Francisco for the weekend to celebrate her birthday. The room was booked through Hyatts own website, which offered a pretty good deal at the time. At our request, we were given a room on the 17th floor, which was very quite. The bed and pillows were incredible. In fact, once we arrived home, we ordered two pillows. If youre interested in purchasing the same pillows, you can purchase them from Pacific Coast Feather Company. Although we ended up with a city view room, it was still enjoyable. If you have an opportunity, try to have dinner at the hotels rotating restaurant. The views from the Equinox restaurant are incredible. However, the food is somewhat overpriced and nothing to write home about. Then again, you're paying for the view. As for the lobby... it's just beautiful. I've read all of the reviews regarding this hotel, especially the critical ones. All I can say is that some folks should just stay home and forget about traveling. Some people are just way too critical and will never be pleased with anything. This is a beautiful hotel with outstanding service.If you're looking to spend some time at a spectacular hotel, then you should certainly put this one on your list.	
Sep 13 2006 	Location was great	Location was great for tourist.... Cable car starts right outside the door and the Ferry building being across the street. Embarcadero buildings next door. Starbucks and a Walgreens across the street help make things convenient. Room wise is was a typical Hyatt room. We checked in late so we were on a low floor (4th Floor) since the hotel was sold out. Which wasn't bad at all.. the noise from the street didn't effect us at all... and somehow we got a handicap room so the bathrooms were extra large. Hotel was nice open atrium look and I would recommend having a drink at the bar equinox (great view and the rotation kinda throws you off but you get use to it). Overall a nice hotel to be in the central area of things and everything can be reached via public transit... either Bart, Cable, Bus, Ferry. Oh and don't bring a car ... the parking will be more then the cost of your room so I suggest taking the Bart into the hotel.... very easy or a cab (not during rush hour traffic or you'll pay) Best bet is the shuttle service or a car service. You won't need your car once you get into the city.	
Sep 11 2006	nice hotel great location felt "nickel and dimed"	This hotel is the perfect location for a view of the bay, access to ferries and the Ferry Terminal Markets (which was our focus). We had a nice room on a high floor and it is not inexpensive. We were a bit taken-aback to find that parking is $50/night with tax and that they even charge $10/day for wifi access. These days almost everyplace offers free wifi ... we felt they were gouging us a bit.	
Aug 29 2006	'I left my heart ...' - thanks in part to Hyatt Regency	This hotel is a gem! Stayed here for a Fri, Sat &amp; Sun night in Aug 2006. Got it from Priceline at an extraordinarily good price (90). My room was on the 3rd floor and I had a partial view of the bay, which was great. Especially when there were fireworks on Friday night! The room itself was very large with a king bed, dresser with TV on a swivel (so you could watch it from anywhere in the room) a desk w/chair, an upholstered chair by the window and another nice comfy upholstered chair with ottoman and convenient reading light/table right next to it. There was a coffee maker and coffee/supplies in the room. Bathroom products were fab with a nice fresh scent - and replenished daily. King size bed was a dream - pillowtop mattress, loads of pillows and a feather comforter. Felt like I was falling into marshamallow fluff each night! You absolutely could not ask for a better located hotel. Right across from the newly renovated ferry building, with all the convenient public transportation right outside the door, including subway to airport and trolley car to Chinatown. Quite a few coffee shops and some fast food type places within steps of the hotel. Embarcadero center shopping (with all the standard chains) right up the street. Definitely go over to the farmers market at the Ferry building on Saturday if you are there. They also have Arts &amp; Crafts booths each weekend right outside the hotel. It is such a breeze to have the ferry right across the street from the Hyatt, too. Just walk over and hop on to spend a day in Sausalito. There are a few nice restaurants within walking distance (reccomend Schroders on Front Street - for great beer and German food.) My stay at the fabulously located, highly appointed Hyatt was a good contributor to &quot;leaving my heart in San Francisco...&quot;	
Aug 28 2006 	Nice Location Nice Hotel	We were sent here by the San Francisco Marriot when they overbooked their hotel. The Marriot paid for our room here. The Hyatt is a wonderful hotel and an architectural marvel. Our room was an executive suite located on the 12th floor with a fantastic view of the bay bridge and street fair below. The furniture in the room was somewhat worn out, but he bed was very nice and comfortable.The staff were extremely pleasant and professional, especially at the front desk and valet parking. We were in the area for Giants game and found this hotel to be a great location and within walking distance to AT&amp;T Park. A nice 20 minute walk along the waterfront. We would certainly stay at this hotel again.	
Aug 25 2006 	One night stay - would have stayed longer but ...	We booked this hotel through Priceline - planning a one-night stay in order to visit the city museums. Since we live only about an hour and a half away by car, we often drive in to SF for a night or two. When we checked in, we were greeted in a very friendly manner by the desk clerk, who offered us the option of upgrading to a bay-view balcony room for $30. We decided to go for it, and we were given a non-smoking room on the 15th floor, which had just been renovated. Our room was lovely - great view from the balcony, and the bed was new and very comfortable, as were the linens (I absolutely loved the duvet-style bedcoverings), and even the carpeting appeared to have been recently replaced. Very nice. The only thing that marred the experience was that the balcony was littered with cigarette butts and spent matches. Obviously, whomever had been in the room previous to us had been a chain smoker - we counted 26 cigarette butts lying outside the room on the balcony. We were surprised that housekeeping apparently doesn't check or clean that area, as the room itself was immaculate, and there was no hint of smoking odors inside the room ... just the butts on the balcony.Bathroom was very clean and stylish. Source soaps, shampoo, conditioner, lotion, etc. Towels were okay - not as plush as I would have expected. No coffee-maker in the room.Parking is expensive, but probably not much more more than most hotels in SF. There is an additional charge for in-and-out privilages, which we thought was a bit excessive, bringing our parking charge (with tax and tips) to over $50 for one night. We enjoyed our stay enough that we decided on a whim to extend our time in the city an extra night. When we inquired at the front desk - with the same clerk who had been so jovial when we checked in - as to the possiblity of staying an additional night, we were abruptly told that was not a possibility, because we had &quot;booked through a third party.&quot; (Priceline) There was no hint of , &quot;I'm sorry, we cannot honor the price you paid, but let me see what the rate would be to stay another night,&quot; which is what we had expected. The hotel did not appear to be very full, either. The clerk just didn't seem at all interested in having us book there for another night. It was kind of strange, after the guy had been so friendly and outgoing the day before ... we ended up booking a room at the Hilton (for substantially less than even our Priceline rate), and stayed another night in the city after all.Overall, we liked the Hyatt Regency - at the Priceline rate, which was $99 (plus tax and upgrade and parking it was closer to $220 total) - but probably wouldn't stay there for the usual rack rate, as there are better locations if you are not in the city on a business trip.	
Aug 24 2006 	Great hotel great location for moms and kids	I took my 10-year old son to SF for a weekend in late July to see a Giants game. This hotel was suggested by travelocity writers as a great choice, and they were right. A weekend AAA discount rate (including breakfast) sealed the deal. We arrived early Friday a.m. and expected to check our bags or be given a smallish room, but we were pleased to be immediately given a large, deluxe double with partial bay views. The room was up to Hyatt standards (upgraded bedding and decor, ample furniture) as was the lobby. I had assumed fisherman's wharf would be the best location with a kid in tow, but this was far better : away from the noise and crowds, close proximity to the things we wanted to do, and the hotel met our every need and more. There is a computer center available for a nominal fee if your kid needs to check his fantasy team (would be nice if they offered it free to hotel guests). There are plenty of family-friendly stores and eateries (Noah's bagels, a Walgreens for a sports drink) right outside the front door if you need them along with upscale shopping if you're inclined. The ballpark is a 5-minute muni ride or a 20-minute walk along the embarcadero. The Metreon videogame.IMAX complex is a short hop down Market street (though take a taxi back if you go at night) Easy bus ride to fisherman's wharf . BART station is literally across the street - take it to/from the airport for $5.15. Front desk was very friendly and helpful when we needed bags held for a late flight, left keys in the room, etc. as was the concierge, however, ignore their recommendations to take a taxi everywhere - walk or use the Muni, at least during the day. No pool (usually a must-have for kids), but you don't even miss it - too much to see and do. If you need water time, take a bay cruise under the Golden Gate bridge. If you are going to alcatraz, be sure to book ahead of time. We didn't and missed out, but that's another reason to come back.This was a great weekend at a great hotel. My son loved the place, and my teenage daughter would love it too. It was doable for us because of the special rate (under $200/night including tax), but if money is not an object, splurge and stay here.	
Aug 14 2006 	Cold 	Stayed three nights on business.First, the positives.1. Location. Hotel is next to trolley station and close to public transportation. Cabs are right outside. No need to rent/bring a car. Easy walking distance to a lot of great restaurants as well.2. View. My bayview room had a very nice view of the water. Some rooms clearly had spectacular views. Others obviously didn't. But if you have a water view, it's special.3. Service. The service was generally good. No waits or lines, even though this very large hotel was hosting a convention. However, I couldn't escape the &quot;plastic smile&quot; syndrome. Everyone said &amp; did all of the right things, but I couldn't get over the feeling that I was nothing but a number among a very large number of people.And now for the negatives.1. Hotel Decor. You either love or hate the lobby. I agree with the reviewer who described it as 70s modern and cavernous. To me, it only added to the cold and impersonal qualities of the hotel.2. Rooms. Nothing special. They are clean but have that somewhat dingy/not remodeled look. The sink area (outside of the bathroom) had been redone but they forgot the bath. It's tiny and in need of updating. You sort of want to get in and out of the tub/shower as quickly as possible. It really looks like a Motel 6. Amenities are bare minimum and mine weren't replaced for 2 days. Also, my room was oddly laid out. Sitting in the desk chair, you could not see the TV. Sitting in the lounge chair you couldn't see the TV. You either had to rearrange furniture or sit on the bed to watch TV. And, some rooms are a LONG way from the elevators.3. Speaking of Elevators . . . there aren't enough and they are tiny. If two people with luggage get in the elevator, no one else can join them.4. Club Level. Don't do it. You get continental breakfast, which is okay when they are prompt at replenishing food (sometime yes, sometimes, no). However, there aren't nearly enough seats in the &quot;lounge.&quot; As a result, one morning people had to eat their breakfast standing up. The evening hors d'hoeuvres are weak and all service ends at 8 p.m. Soft drinks are free; alcohol will cost you (apparently due to CA law). 5. Internet. No wired service; only wireless for $10. I know a lot of folks mentioned problems with noise. I had none. Not sure if this was because I was on a high floor or if the crowd was quieter than usual.Overall, I came away with two impressions. First, they were trying to nickel &amp; dime you to death. (Water in room is $6; fees in club lounge; they serve you coffee and OJ immediately upon being seated at breakfast -- before you find out it will set you back $8.50 + tax/tip). Second, it was just another huge hotel and you, the guest, are just another traveler passing through. I've stayed at several other SF hotels and, if I came again, would stay at one of those rather than return to the Hyatt. The experience wasn't terrible, it just wasn't terribly good.	
Jul 18 2006	It was a magical mini-vacation	We went to the Hyatt over Memorial Day, a perfect time since there were no crowds anywhere. The staff at the Hyatt were exceptionally nice and helpful. My husband asked for a room with a good view, and we got #1013 which looks directly onto the Ferry Building, The Bay Bridge and the bay. We had lovely sail boats by day and twinkling lights at night. The room was beautifully decorated with six or seven different textures and patterns which all worked together perfectly. The bed was super comfortable. We will definitely return any chance we get.	
Jul 9 2006	Pack your earplugs	I agree with many of the recent reviewers that this hotel falls short of a 4-star ranking. The staff are pleasant and polite and check-in was fast and efficient. While my room was clean, with contemporary furniture and a comfortable bed, there was nothing special about the decor, the towels were paper-thin (like the kind you usually find in Motel 6 and the like), and the shower was somewhat dated with dirty grout and old fixtures. The building itself leaves much to be desired. It is a very large and impersonal structure that appears to have been built no later than the late 1970s when stark concrete was in vogue. The lobby atrium area is very dark and has the feel of a concrete cave. Also, the elevators are woefully inadequate. There is a single bank of elevators on one side of this very large building; it took about 3 minutes at a brisk pace to walk from my room to the elevators. Once there, one often has to wait for 2 or 3 elevators because they are overcrowded. The worst thing about this hotel, by far, is the noise, from both inside and outside. I was unable to fall asleep until after 2:00 a.m. due to (1) very loud music over loudspeakers in the hotel's atrium outside my door (apparently designed to set the proper mood for the hotel bar regardless whether the hotel guests might be trying to sleep), and (2) noise and general rowdiness from outdoor patrons of a bar adjacent to the hotel. The atrium music stopped at midnight. When I complained to the front desk about the loud music from the bar just beneath my window, I was told they had previously had complaints about noise from that bar but that there was nothing they could do about it. I was just told that &quot;last call&quot; at the bar was 1:45 a.m. and that it should quiet down after that! It is no exaggeration to say that this supposedly 4-star hotel had the feel of a cheap dive over some honky-tonk bar in the middle of nowhere. I have never experienced such a noisy hotel in all my years of traveling. To be fair to the hotel, however, I must say that I did obtain this room via Priceline and it's possible the front desk clerk consciously gave me the noisiest room in the least convenient location and that, if you paid full price, you might get something quieter or more convenient.All in all, there are much better choices in San Francisco at this price point. If you can get a room here for a very modest price, and if you bring earplugs, the hotel is OK, but do not pay anything close to full price or expect a 4-star hotel or else you will be very disappointed.	
Jul 8 2006	Overall not Bad for the Price Line Deal	Overall we enjoyed our stay, although we did not spend much time at the hotel and we only spent one night here. It is about 2 miles from the Fishermans Warf and pier 39 area, but we thought it was overall a nice hotel. Our room was clean. Upon arrival they asked if I wanted to upgrade to a bay view room for 30 bucks more- I declined however we were pleasantly surprised that we were able to see the bay from our room anyway. (see attached picture of view from the room) The room was clean and nice- (possibly a bit out dated as mentioned in other reviews over all it was not bad. I enjoyed the price of $99 (with tax and fees it was about $120) we got it off price line by selecting a 4 star hotel anywhere in San Francisco. The big downside is the parking (which is a problem most anywhere in Down Town San Fran) the only option the hotel offers is for valet parking at the hotel at $43 a night plus tax which results in about $50 a night or you can park across the street in an underground mall parking lot for $28.50 a night. Either way you feel you are paying way too much- but I believe the excessive parking fee is to be expected for anywhere you go in San Fran. Overall we liked it despite the parking, and considering the amount that we paid for it. We would probably stay there again however I would try something a little closer to Fisherman's Warf if youre a tourist.	
Jul 6 2006	Convenient and Nice	The hotel lobby still impresses me no matter how many times I've been there. The rooms are clean and comfortable. The staff were all professional and courteous. The Embarcadero has been revitalized and the Hyatt is in a prime location to take advantage of the changes. BART/Muni/Cable Car (California St.)/Streetcars are all within steps from the hotel. I felt is was a really great value. My only complaint was that the parking was expensive at $49/night. I am already planning another stay in SF and will definitely look into getting a room at the Hyatt.	
Jul 4 2006	Noisy	We paid to upgrade to a view room with balcony. Next time (if there is one) I think I'll skip it. We called housekeeping when we arrived because there was bird poop on the patio chairs and the glasses were dirty. We left before housekeeping arrived and they cleaned the chairs, but left the dirty glasses.The bed was so, so, but not 4 stars. The worst part was the noise from next store. We could hear them talking and (everything else they did!) as if they were in the same room with us. I guess the pass through door was the weak link in the acostics.We weren't even pleased with the public areas. The giant attrium and vast expanses of concrete were so 60's and dated. It felt dark and cavernous like. I will avoid this hotel in the future.	
Jun 18 2006 	Top Notch Staff and Location.	I've stayed here three times over the past 25 years. The lobby is still striking, the embarcadero location is near everything (and across from the ferry building), and the staff is professional, courteous, and they all went out of the way for us- front desk, valet, bellman... The rooms were above average. The bedding and toiletries were very good, but the sliding bathroom door didn't cut it. I paid $100 on priceline and felt like I got the deal of a lifetime. Problem- parking was $49/day!!!!!! Shame on them. They ONLY overnight option we found was down the street for $28. Still, I'll definately stay here again.	
Jun 6 2006	Past its best	I was looking forward to my first trip to San Fran and decided to choose what I thought was an upmarket hotel for our four night stay. I was wrong. The Hyatt Regency has seen better days and is well overpriced compared to other City Hotels.The service at check in was average and they were more intersted in getting me to upgrade to a Bay view room and pay for breakfast in advance. I did this to find that I could see the Bay as long as I leaned over the balcony and looked to my right - not a Bay view from the room. The room itself was very drab and tired. The patio doors were loose with worn seals, the carpet was stained and faded and the bedcover was torn and very old. The items in the minibar were expensive including the unchilled water for $6. A Hotel like this should provide at least one bottle of water free of charge - not the Hyatt Regency. A four star Hotel - I think not!! - plenty of others to choose in San Fran avoid this one.	
Jun 1 2006	Rooms are definately not 4*	The outside of the hotel is beautiful. The lobby is breathtaking. We had a wonderful view of the bay bridge from our room and right outside the door. We stayed on the regency floor and enjoyed the services. And the best thing about this hotel : LOCATION! If you plan on staying here and don't mind the crummy rooms, then don't ever rent a car! The street cars and Trolleys are literally on your doorstep. But I must say the furnishing in the rooms were a complete disappointment. Holes in footrest and comforter??? Come on Hyatt!! I stayed at a crowne plaza hotel the day before and enjoyed plush furnishings. I understand this is a business hotel, hence the Spartan decorations but seriously, torn and aging furniture is an eyesore and not worth the price. On the plus side, the staff were excellent and prompt in meeting our needs.	
May 31 2006	Just an OK hotel	Just returned from a 1 day stay at the Hyatt Regency San Francisco Downtown.LOCATION: Its an OK hotel in Embarcadero area. The hotel is close to Muni/BART train stationand is quite safe even late at night.ROOM: The room that was offered to me was anon-smoking room in the 9th floor. The roomwas stuffy and bathroom was cramped in space.The carpet and furniture was old and worn.FACILITIES: The room has high speed wired internet access available for an extra $10 for 24 hours. Thehotel itself has a cold feel.To SUM UP, this is just an OK hotel. You could chooseto stay if you get a real good deal. Otherwise I'd recommend shopping around for better value.	
Apr 6 2006	Very Satisfying Stay	We were in San Francisco for business and this was the conference hotel, so we stayed here with expectations no more or less than what you usually get with a large convention facility. We were delighted.First of all, we took BART from SFO airport and the stop is indeed right at the hotel's front door. I was a little hesitant to take BART because I didn't want to be lugging suitcases down a sidewalk at night, but we literally walked just a few steps and we were inside. We were a little confused as the lobby area is one flight up from the street level, but we soon got our bearings and went to check in.The staff were extremely welcoming and pleasant to deal with. They upgraded us to the Regency Floor (16th Floor) without our requesting it. The room was large and very pleasant with a balcony with double doors that you could really open and step outside for an incredible view of the bay and Ferry Building. We were treated to a complimentary breakfast each morning which was surprisingly good with fresh fruit and a coffee machine which dispensed Starbuck's Coffee one cup at a time -- I mean, it ground the beans and literally brewed one cup at a time. The Ferry Building and adjacent open areas was full on the weekend of artisans and people with fresh produce. We ended up one night eating on our balcony with fresh bread, cheese, tomatoes, raisins, and a killer bottle of Pinot Noir from the market shops.I've got to give one or two criticisms here, else someone may think that this review is exaggerated. First of all, the halls from the elevators are very long and it does take a while to get around. The hotel is large, though, so I suppose that is expected. As we walked to our room, the end of the hall was a picture window with a gorgeous view of the bay. I told my husband I felt like I was on a cruise ship as I walked with that view in front of me.The other mild criticism is that the concierge gave us wrong information regarding taking a bus to Haight Street. It was the weekend and she told us to catch Bus No. *** (can't remember the number) which stopped right outside. Yes, Bus No. *** did stop right outside - Monday through Friday - but not on the weekends. We got a little frustrated, and ended up in a cab which was expensive, but even that worked to our advantage as it started raining as we were being driven to our destination.All in all, I highly recommend this hotel for any reason - business or pleasure. The staff (except for the ditzy concierge) could not have been more helpful, attentive, or pleasant, and we would definitely stay here again.	
Mar 27 2006 	A very pleasant stay	A recent conference at this hotel prompted my stay and since the room was discounted to $229/night I decided to stay here rather than have to stay elsewhere and walk back to this hotel for the daily meetings. I ended up with a handicapped room as all of the other nonsmoking rooms were taken, and this allowed for a more roomy accomodation as well as a bigger bathroom, so I can't fairly comment on what a &quot;normal&quot; sized room might be like. The room was extremely clean, as was the bathroom, and had fabulous city views and a short walk down the hallway allowed for incredible views of the Bay Bridge and the Ferry Building. Interior of the hotel is very modern and spacious with a well stocked gift shop and very decent restaurants/bars. The exercise room was very well equipped and showed movies while you work out. The location of the hotel is extremely convenient-very close to the cable car stop as well as BART and Muni bus stops and within walking distance of the piers and Fisherman's Wharf. The only drawbacks were that the parking is horribly expensive (valet charges $40/day plus a $5 &quot;parking tax&quot; and if you self-park you get charged $30 each time you re-enter the parking garage) and there is no swimming pool. Overall, though, a very nice stay and I would definitely stay here again for the right price.	
Mar 22 2006	Excellent Hyatt	I stayed at the Hyatt Regency Embarcadero in San Francisco for one night in March 2006. I was only there for one night before moving to another hotel for the remainder of my stay. The location of the hotel is perfect, especially for people using public transportation. I flew in and out of Oakland airport and the Embarcadero BART stop is only four from the Coliseum/Oakland Airport BART station. When you emerge from the BART station the Hyatt is right there above your head. The room was enormous (especially for San Francisco). I had asked for a high, quiet room and was given one on the 12th floor of the Drumm Street side of the hotel. The room and ammenities were excellent. The shower/tub, toilet room is separate from the sink area and is very small. The water pressure in the shower is great with easily adjustable flow and direction. I would stay at the Hyatt Regency Embarcadero again, especially if I was able to secure a great rate (I had a senior discount this time).	
Mar 3 2006	good business hotel close to the embarcadero	great hotel at a great location. at the rates i got from priceline -- it was a steal! it's primarily a business hotel and is next door to the financial district. but it's also walking distance to great dining, sight-seeing and bar-hopping. if you are too tired out to go out, try the equinox bar at the penthouse. it's the only revolving restaurant in san francisco and offers great views of the city. stayed at a city view room, but even that had a great view of the bay bridge. checked in on a friday night for an awesome rate, woke up saturday to experience the embarcadero weekend market. overall, a wonderful experience, highly recommended, will come back!	
Feb 19 2006	Public areas are 4* but not the rooms	We just returned from a $70 Priceline stay at the Hyatt Regency Embarcadero. At this price, the hotel was a great value. Some thoughts: The public areas are 4* all the way, but our room on the 3rd floor had 2* furnishings and just wasnt up to basic business class standards  let alone 4*. It was clean, but bathroom counter had markings on it, interior of room was drab, design was very outdated, cheap linens, tacky comforter, not enough furniture (room needed a nice chair &amp; ottoman), etc. We parked at 4 Embarcadero Center for $28 overnight, which is a bargain compared to what the hotel charges. We didnt eat at the restaurants, so I cant comment on that. The other challenge with this property is that it's a l-o-n-g walk to Union Square, which is our favorite shopping spot. So, I probably wont be bidding on this zone again for that reason. All in all, this hotel was a good value for what we paid, but compared to the SF Hilton or SF Marriott, for example, this property just does not measure up to 4* standards. At best, it deserves the 3* rating that it used to have. By the way, the front desk staff was excellent! The nice guy who helped us easily accommodated our request for a king, non-smoking room. We had a nice view of the Transamerica Tower, so I cant complain about that either. There is just no way that our room had that top-level amenities and furnishings that it should have had to deserve the 4* rating.	
Feb 2 2006 	I'll stay elsewhere in the future	I chose this hotel because of it's location - it's convenient to the Embarcadero and Financial District. I upgraded to a &quot;bay view&quot; room. The only way to see the bay from my room was to lean out over the balcony. I had to drape a towel over the furniture on the balcony it was so dirty.There were water stains and paint peeling from the ceiling, and stains on the carpet. The rest of the hotel is very dated as well.Front desk staff were very aloof, didn't seem to care about customers. Definitely not worth the money.	
Jan 31 2006 	Great Hotel/Perfect Location	We just got back from a stay at this hotel and have to admit we were pleasantly surprised at how enjoyable it was (in spite of several touchy reviews we have read). We went for a conference and after reading a few negative reviews had considered staying elsewhere, however we are extremely glad we decided to 'tough it out'at the conference hotel. The hotel was great, and the staff was extremely helpful and pleasant. We asked for a room with a view, high floor, and near the elevator (based on other reviews). The pleasant reception desk person told us that view rooms were not near the elevator, so we opted to go for the view. We had a 15th floor room with an outstanding view of the Bay and Oakland Bay bridge/Ferry building. It might have been better, but we're not sure how.As others have mentioned, the location really makes this a top choice. We had purchased the City Pass on line which gave free access to all Muni Transport as well as a number of museums (very worthwhile). We also purchased AirBart Tix on line to get us to the hotel. The Bart station is right outside the door of the hotel. Also, the famous cable cars, restored trolleys on the F line (access to the Piers as well as all the way up Market to the Castro), Muni underground, and all kinds of bus lines are literally right outside the door! The location cannot be beat.And a great meal was had at Chow at the Church St. station on both the trolley and the underground.And across the street is the Ferry Building with all kinds of shops and restaurants. We particularly enjoyed the Hog Island Oyster Co.(the owner was on line in front of us and refused to 'pull rank'; he even allowed us to take a better located table!). Also, Cowgirl Creamery Cheese is not to be missed.Do not be afraid of this hotel -- it will serve you well (OK, the pillows ae a little flat.).	
Jan 6 2006	Wonderful Location	I love this hotel!!Well, lets start with the downside!! The bed wasnt comfortable and the pillows are flat. I have no problem since I brought my travel pillow with me. But other then that, everything is great and wonderful! Staff are very friendly and helpful. Maid service were great! The food in the hotel just simple. But if you are lazy to get out, Room service is not that bad, the food is from their restaurants, we order the Breakfast from the room service and it was wonderful. We will go back to this Hotel again!! This hotel right next to the ferry building, one of the must go place when you visit SF. Why? the Restaurants inside the ferry building are great. Yes, the price maybe a little higher, but the food was great.The Muni and the Bart station just few steps away. Cable car station is in front of the hotel as well. So dont be cheap if you are visiting SF more than 3 days, buy a 3 days Muni pass, you can ride on the any cable car, Muni buses, Muni undergrand system and F line. Check the map from the hotel or the SF Visitor Center, F line take you from place to place easy and fast.	
Dec 30 2005	Reservations not honored*REGENCY FLOOR*problems w/beds	We booked Nov 1st 2 rooms on the Regency Level-indicated that we needed 2 beds in each room--as we have a family. This was noted and confirmed. Upon our arrival we were given rooms w/1 king bed in each--and they told us (a lie) that this level only had king beds in the room. Untrue. Next they said they were out of cots-until I called again and spoke to the manager and told him that 2 large boys could NOT share a bed--and we needed at least 1 cot. We did get 1 cot--A basic apology was given-but no attempt to find another room w/ 2 double beds. We will never stay there again since they failed to accomodate us. The Regency Club does offer a breakfast--with inadequate tables, chairs, and service personnel to keep the area neat. Basically, not worth the extra charge. If you stay there CALL BEFORE and make then guarantee the room arrangements! Otherwise a family may have to share 1 bed.	
Dec 26 2005	Enjoyed our stay at the Hyatt	My family (including husband, brother, sister in law and 17 year old nephew) just got back from a 5 night stay at the Hyatt and thoroughly enjoyed the hotel and the city. We had all been to SF several times previously but never as a group. We had a great package deal on Hotwire and chose this hotel because of its easy location to public transportation. We took BART from the airport to the hotel and had an easy time. Check in was a bit complicated because both rooms were under one name, but once resolved we had nice rooms on the 10th floor. Our room with King bed had a great view of the harbor...my brother's room with 2 double beds had a city view. Both rooms were fine as far as bedding and mattresses go. There was no torn carpet or dirty bathrooms and service was good. We had bought a city pass for $42(highly recommended) and used it for a boat tour, several museums and unlimited use of muni transportation. People were extra friendly and helped us with directions when needed. We rode the cable cars and buses all over and managed to do a lot in spite of almost constant rain. We rented a car for the day to go to Napa (there is a Budget car rental in the hotel and we could return it any time that evening to the valet). All in all it was a great family time and we had no real complaints. The hotel is fine unless you are paying full price. (most hotels are not worth rack rate!)	
Dec 23 2005 	Not Up to Expectations	My husband's company was hosting a Christmas Party at a restaurant at one of the SF Piers. Decided to stay at the Hyatt because it was walking distance to the party. Being a Hyatt Passport member I booked a &quot;Fab Friday&quot; rate on the official Hyatt website which included free valet parking and free appetizer at the lounge. The &quot;Fab Friday&quot; room rate was $140 for a standard room. We opted for the regency club suite for $240 for the big night out. I took BART into the city to meet my husband. If I would have taken the right BART escalator up to street level I wouldn't have even had to cross the street. Very convenient. Check in was quick. I was presented with an envelope that had coupons for the free appetizer and a letter noting that I would receive free valet parking with the &quot;Fab Friday&quot; rate. A reviewer has already described the suite quite accurately and provided pictures so I won't go into a description, but for a suite I have to say that the bed was no better than a bed in a one star motel. That bed was rock hard. Just a scratchy flat sheet thrown over the thin mattress. What was &quot;regency club&quot; about that bed. No pillow top mattress, no comforter, no upgraded linens, no turn down service. We did order room service when we got back from the company party. Room service was fast and food was good. The ice cream was still frozen too. The surprise came the next morning when I previewed my bill via the t.v. The rate was suppose to be $240 but they were charging me $299. I called down to the front desk and brought it to their attention. The front desk person told me that I was being charged $299 because I upgraded to a suite. No, I explained the rate of $240 that I had on my printed comfirmation was for a suite. She put me on hold and never came back. After being on hold for almost ten minutes another clerk came on the phone and I told him about the rate descrepancy. He didn't argue with me and agreed to reduce the rate to $240. I went down to the front desk and picked up a copy of the bill just to be sure. One of the reasons I reserved the room on the official Hyatt website was so that I would get the Hyatt gold passport points. I was reading the bill on the ride home and there was an asterisk next to the $240 rate. The asterisk meant that the rate was not eligible for Hyatt gold points. That wasn't mentioned when I booked the room. That fact wasn't noted in fine print in the letter I received at check in. Nice. Booked on their own website and didn't get any points. Don't think I'll be staying there again.	
Dec 21 2005	Great stay in San Fran!	We really liked the hotel...when we arrived, they didn't have any non-smoking regular rooms available for us, so we upgraded to a suite with a bay view for another $15/night. We were there for 3 nights...parking was expensive, but we only had the rental car there for the first night before we returned it. It was a bit far of a walk to all the touristy things, but manageable. We ate at the restaurant on the top floor one night (reservations recommended) which spins to get a complete look at the city - good food and we had been given coupons at the front desk on check in, so all in all not too expensive of a meal...clean, nicely taken care of...we had a wonderful time!	
Dec 21 2005	Regency Suite Stay - Great Experience	We stayed at the Hyatt Regency Embarcadero about 7 times and have had positive experiences each time. The regular rooms are compact and the beds are only doubles. But the architecture of the hotel is incomparable and the atrium has been a city tourist landmark for over 30 years. Our recent stay was our best experience by far, simply because we opted to try a Regency Suite. Though more expensive at $269 (although not much more for &quot;regular&quot; rooms at other SF hotels we checked), our family of 4 fit comfortably. The Suite consists of a very large living room with a sofa, side chair and ottoman, table with 4 chairs and an armoire containing the television, an empty refrigerator, in-room safe and another stocked refrigerator. Floor to ceiling sliding glass doors led out to the 30' balcony overlooking Market Street. With a few furniture rearrangements, two rollaway beds easily fit into the room for my children, since the sofa did not convert into a sofa bed. There is a guest bathroom with sink and toilet in a small hallway that connected the master bedroom with the living room. The master bedroom had a separate bathroom with tub with jets and separate shower stall, all done up in black marble. There was another armoire for the television unit, a full closet, and a work desk and lounge chair. The furnishings were contemporary and in good shape, and the room was clean and pretty soundproof. The only hotel dining we did was breakfast in The Eclipse Café, which had an expensive $23 breakfast buffet that was very basic and not worth the cost (our room rate included the buffet). But the location is excellent to the major attractions of central San Francisco  Union Square is only two subway stops away, the new food hall at the Ferry Bldg is across the street, the Cable Car starts and ends in front of the Hyatt, and Fishermans Wharf is walking distance or a short trolley ride away. The area of the Hyatt is very safe and there are lots of tourists walking around and the urban residential areas around the hotel are some of the most expensive in San Francisco. During the work week, the area is buzzing, since it is in the Financial District. We had another great experience.	
Dec 17 2005	Not 4-star quality-but thoroughly enjoyable	I just returned from a short weekend stay with a friend. GREAT location, we were able to walk to Union Square and SBC Park, but this is a rather long walk for most. Plenty of available cabs and public transporation from the hotel if you are not up to the walk. We self-parked for $28/day at 3 Embarcadero (hotel is 5 Embarcadero) The wait for valet at the hotel can be up to 45 minutes, and they charge about $40/day. We were allowed to check in to our 10th floor room several hours early. The room was clean with newer furniture. The beds and pillows were very comfortable. Our room overlooked Drumm Street, facing away from the Bay, with no balcony. The sliding doors did open to let in fresh air, however. It was noisy, and we awoke before 8am to 2 ladies with megaphones protesting something or other. For about 20 minutes they would alternate shouting &quot;1-2-3-4&quot; &quot;something something about Al Gore&quot; &quot;5-6-7-8&quot; something something, negotiate!&quot; Annoying, and nothing was done to stop them. The ice machine was WAAAAAY on the other side of the building and the hallways were quite narrow so this could prove problematic for those with mobility issues. There is a charge for emptying the honor bar and filling it with your own groceries. We did not do this, of course, but I have never seen a hotel charge for this in the past. We ate at the revolving restaurant (Equinox) because we were given 50% off meal coupons. It took us a while to figure out that you cannot get to the Equinox from the 10th floor. We finally ended up going down to the lobby level and taking the express elevator to the restaurant. Do not go here for the food-you are paying for the view. Our seafood pasta dishes were 30$ each, before the discount. It is pretty hard to mess up pasta, but the seafood was not the freshest and the heat was not evenly distributed throughout. Great for shopping at the Ferry Building-great farmer's market several days a week. The christmas ice rink is right there, and it is a quick easy walk to Chinatown. The lobby is still pretty impressive and deocorated for the holidays. Overall, we were happy with what we got for the price ($99/night) and I would stay again, but this is certainly NOT a 4-star hotel and it is not posh nor luxurious, but certainly worth a try if you can get it under 100 a night.	
Nov 28 2005	Four-star rating undeserved	I agree--priceline should reduce the rating to 3-star. I received a price of $80 per night, and it was also much farther than I had expected, hoping for something closer to Union Square without getting near the Tenderloin. The location was okay, though, and the Ferry Building and transportation were great. View was gorgeous, room service was quick.Now to the bad stuff....The room, despite having been remodeled maybe in the last 5-10 years, was in bad shape. Peeling wallpaper, leaking toilet, stains and holes in the armchair (the cushions actually were several shades darker in the places people normally sit), and worst, bloodstains on the pillow. Yes, that's right--well washed and dried, but blood nonetheless. We grabbed a pillow from the closet which looked fairly clean, and threw the other one in a corner.I know we could have gone to the front desk and complained and would likely have been moved to a better room, but how much better could it have gotten? Besides, it was crowded and Thanksgiving and we were exhausted. So, overall, the quality was akin to a Motel 6, but the location, price, and view were favorable when compared to other area hotels.	
Oct 25 2005	Depends what you want	We had mixed emotions about our stay at this hotel. There was nothing terribly wrong, but it also didn't seem to be a very good value for what it cost. I did not go through Priceline and get $80-$90 like many seem to here, and I probably would have found this hotel to be a good value at that price. Location is outstanding if you are avoiding renting a car and paying the outrageous parking fees. It is right at a BART station and the beginning of the California st cable car line. Many bus routes stop within 2-3 blocks. The Ferry building is right across the street with neat shops and restaurants. Access to the wharf areas was an easy trolley ride away or a comfortable 20-30 minute walk (over flat terrain) if you are looking for a pleasant walk.Rooms and amenities are very standard business-focused hotel issue. The deck was nice as the weather was very good when we were there and it was a pleasant place to sit and read. The only noise issues were from very loud motorcycles that seem to cruise endlessly down the Embarcadero into the very wee hours of the morning during weekends. Front desk service was very helpful and quick. We didn't eat at any of the restaurants - too many good places to eat in SF to do that.Overall a fine experience, but not special enough to justify the cost.	
Oct 14 2005	no better than low cost holiday inn	We stayed in this hotel early October. Luckily we only paid $85 a night through priceline. This is not a four star hotel at this point. The location is fine, lobby very nice but the rooms are not worth full price. The bedding was terrible, just a loose top sheet thrown over the mattress, the towels in the bathroom were worn, thin and scratchy. The bathroom was tiny and cramped. Amenities were a joke, only shampoo and conditioner was given, had to ask for body lotion, shower cap, etc. which were given when asked. Lighting in the room was terrible, Overall, would not stay there again unless the price was really cheap. Location is fine, subway and cable cars are right outside the entrance, but if you want to go downtown and walk, quite a distance. Priceline should not give this a four star rating.	
Oct 3 2005 	Great Experience	My husband was attending a conference at the hotel, and I went along for the sightseeing. We arrived at 10pm and were given keys to our room on the third floor. When we arrived at the room, the housekeeper was just beginning to clean the room. We returned to the front desk where a very friendly staff member apologized, and immediately upgraded our room to a suite on the 7th floor, at no extra charge to us. We were very impressed by the size of the rooms, and had no complaints. The decor was updated, and the bathrooms large and nicley decorated. I especially enjoyed the jacuzzi in the bedroom bath, although I did have some problems with the controls at first. We had a balcony in both the living area and the bedroomin which we liked having the doors open to enjoy the fresh air coming in. We were particularly impressed with the quietness of the hotel. It was full the three nights we were there, and never once heard noised in the rooms, or loudness in the hotel itself. The hotel lobby is unique and nicely furnished. The glass elevators were quick to pick us up, and smooth to ride. They added a nice touch to the lobby. We had bellboys hold our luggage until our redeye flight, and found them to be as friendly and accomodating as the rest of the staff we had met. We would recommend the hotel to everyone, and would consider returning if we ever have the chance	
Sep 26 2005	Poor service high price	This is a big hotel with some splendid views, but its size is part of its problem. With so many guests, some services were well below average. Everything seems to take a long time: whether its getting your car out of the exorbitant valet parking, or just waiting for an elevator. Upon check in our room was dirty with glasses from the previous guest. It took an hour for us to get our luggage, maybe not a problem for some, but we were supposed to meet friends and this wait caused us to be late. I called the concierge on two occasions, and they were less than helpful ; one occasion they were so busy discussing someones outfit on the Emmys they couldnt be bothered to help me. If you are excited to be staying at a hotel with a kitschy revolving bar, get there quick, it closes down very early. I will say that the room was very quiet, unusual for such a large businesspersons hotel. The only other bright spot was the courteous and knowledgeable doorman. Although the location is good, given a choice, I wont be back to the Hyatt Regency.	
Sep 14 2005	Not quite a four-star	We spent a night at this hotel after staying at the Omni. The Hyatt Regency is bigger and the main lobby is very impressive. Room is fine but the bathroom is very outdated -- beige tiled walls with black marble floor, not really something you see from a four-star hotel. Service is impersonal as this hotel is for business travelers. The best thing is the view of the Bay Bridge from our room. Probably won't go back.	
Sep 13 2005	Fantastic Hotel	My partner and I just returned from a weeks stay at the Hyatt Regency and I must say I was very impressed.The lobby is very impressive and all the rooms overlook the lobby. A Glass lift takes you up to your room.When we checked in the Lady at the front Desk upgraded us to a Business class room with a wonderful view of the Bay Bridge (see photo). We also asked for a fridge as Breakfast was not included in our Hotwire 100$ a night rate. They didn't charge us the usual 20$ for the fridge either. There are a couple of shops across from the hotel where we got food for the morning.The hotel itself is in a really nice area across the street from the ferry building. This is an excellent location for all transport, as the Bart ,Muni and cable cars all run to the ferry building.The room was very nice and bigger than average, and it had the most comfortable bed ever. The pillows were very comfortable I don't understand what other people were complaining about. We both got extremely good nights sleep every night. The bathroom was small but there was a separate area outside for the sink and vanity area.We were also given a 50% discount vouchers for all Hyatt restaurants in San Fran. On our last night we had a meal with drinks in the Equinox on the top of the hotel. While expensive, I would highly recommend it.San Francisco is a lovely city with extremely nice views from the hills and roads. The best way to travel is to walk around the city.I would highly recommend staying at the Hyatt Regency.	
Sep 12 2005	Cool Hotel-great location	I was searching for a hotel in San Francisco on Expedia when I decided to &quot;roll the dice&quot; with Priceline...My $80.00 bid was accepted by the Hyatt at the Embarcadero. At first, I was a little upset that I hadn't landed a trendier &quot;boutique&quot; hotel as I'm really not a chain-hotel type of person. Upon arrival at the Hyatt however, I was presently surprised to find a totally modern, architectually interesting hotel in a fantastic location of the city. Upon check-in, we requested a room on a high floor and were given a spacious room on the 12th floor overlooking the Bay, complete with a large patio. The room was stylish and understated; lovely framed photographs, comfortable overstuffed chair with ottoman and a comfortable bed. The mini bar was stocked with lots of goodies, but for those interested in saving a little $, head to the Walgreens across the street for sodas, beer, wine, chips etc. Parking is expensive, but there are a number of lots available that are more afordable (if you don't mind parking your own car.) Tons of shops in the area and the close proximity to BART, the MUNI and cable cars makes it incredibly easy to get around town. I would def. recommend this hotel and will stay here again on my next visit!	
Aug 23 2005	wondeful hotel!!!! the best location and.......	I just want to let people know that this is a wonderful hotel. This hotel is not only beautiful but it is in a Great location!. I rented this hotel for my parents &amp; little brother for their first trip out to the west coast. I recieved a awesome rate from priceline 80.00 dollars a night for a hotel that costs 250.00 per night. The hotel staff is very nice and always helpful. The rooms are clean most views are nice. The hotel was booked for the entire weekend but there was no loud noise or traffic through the hotel. This hotel treated my family very well and made them feel very comfortable. I read a few review's of this hotel (on this site) and most people give this hotel a good to great review. There are a couple people who wrote reviews that just needed something to complain about so they complained about the PILLOWS. This is the stupidist thing i have ever heard. Yes the pillows are soft but all you have to do is call the front and have them brings u extra pillows. On a score of 1 thru 10 this hotel is deff a 8 or 9.	
Aug 15 2005	Wonderful View	First off, check in was awesome, no line, no wait etc.Had reservations for Club level, balcony room.Room was on the 16th level, nice sized, balcony was alright, 2 chairs and a table. Shower/bath was small, updated shower head but would have been nice if it was higher, had to bend over to get head wet (i'm 6'1)Got this room mainly for the club level opportunity of the lounge in the evening and breakfast.I was disappointed to find out that alcoholic drinks had to be paid for in the lounge, and only non alcoholic drinks were free. (I had figured that this was going to be like Embassy suites were all the drinks were free no matter what they were, this was a disappointment) They had very little in the way of appetizers as well. The bed was nice (nothing special, no special sheets or pillows), you could hear the people walking upstairs in their room on the 17th floor and occasionally you could hear the plumbing from other rooms. As far as location it was an excellent jumping off point, to explore the city.I wouldn't pay full price for the room again which was over 200 with AAA discount. oh and as far as the continental breakfast in the lounge, it was ok, it consisted of yogurt, juices, coffee, fruit, banana bread, lemon pound cake, english muffins, toast (although the toaster seemed to be broken at the time) Enough to fill you up, but again nothing like what embassy suites offers to all their guests. I just wish there was an embassy suites in the city.over all impression It was a decent hotel but for the money I wouldn't pay for the club level again, it wasn't worth it.	
Aug 12 2005 	Pleasant stay	We stayed at the Hyatt in July 2005. The architecture of the lobby is impressive and perhaps the best feature of the hotel. THe staff is very accomodating and polite. We checked in around 12am and were given a room with a view of the city, which was nice but being in san francisco, we really wanted a view of the bay. THe staff at the front desk suggested to call back in the AM to see if any bay views were available. We lucked out and got a room with a bay view for the rest of our stay. Both rooms were quite clean. Beds were very comfortable. THe shower and hot/cold knobs were a bit confusing to adjust---some guests even called up front desk for a tutorial. Things to beware of: the restaurant in the lobby is quite pricey (as expected) and be alert if you go--dont open the bottled water on the tables unless you are prepared to pay 6 bucks for it. (there's a clear sticker price over the top-- that is easily missed). A good spot for breakfast is the cafe across the street. Secondly, this isnt NYC, most restaurants were closed after 9-10pm. The Chinese restaurant inthe adjacent shopping mall is quite good but also expensive. THe Italian one, one flight up is just expensive and not very palatable. Best features: view, Location to the embarcadero, and proximity of bart/cable cars. we would come here again for a good deal. ITsnot really worth more than 200 a night.	
Aug 10 2005	good hotel but nothing unique	A nice hotel in a great city. Nice location. I read a review from someone else here describing the lobby as &quot;a lot of dusty, fake greenery.&quot; I do agree, the lobby is big, but not bright and cheery. It's you typical large city convention hotel, not too much character. I have come to the conclusion that longtime business travelers have know for a long time: it doesnt matter what the brand of hotel is, they are all the same in a city. Please please please don't pay more just because this is a Hyatt because it could easily be any other hotel. The name means nothing in a city. When visiting San Francisco, dont have a car unless you need it. This hotel is located with public transit right outside your door. The California line for trolley cars is just feet from the door, BART and the MUNI metro are across the street. The F-Line streetcars run right by the hotel and go to Fishermans Warf and Union Square. The ferry building is located in the back of the hotel and will take you to Sausalito. We even got to Muir Woods without a car by using the very comfortable and efficient Golden Gate Transit Buses. The embarcadero and ferry building is fun to hang out at on an afternoon for a long lunch and lazy day of shopping. There was an art festival with vendors and such on the weekend when we were there. The hotel rooms are about the normal size for a city hotel. The bathroom is quite small and not all that luxiourus. The Mini-bar is computerized so dont think your storing anything of yours in there. It's overpriced as usual ($3.50 for a can of soda) but once in a while its fun to empty it out when your business is paying. Otherwise, there is a Walgreens, 7-11 and Starbucks located across the street for more reasonable snacking. The fitness center is small and there is no pool. We did not see the revolving restaurant. I will warn you that we ate at the breakfast buffet in the morning for free but if your paying it's an outrageous $20 per person! Its good food but not worth that much!If you have ever been to NYC you will appreciate this comparison. If you love time square and all of its tackiness, stay at Fishermans Warf. If you enjoy the more laid back areas that are not as touristy then stay out of the Warf area. If you have any questions about the transit in the area of the hotel dont hesitate to email me.	
Aug 8 2005	Okay but not 4 star standard	I stayed at this hotel on June 19, 2005. I was excited to stay at 4 star hotel but it didn't live up to expectations. The atrium was nice, but not grand. It looks a bit outdated. Service was adequate, but our room could use improvement. The room seemed a bit &quot;tired&quot;. The faucet handle was difficult to turn, toilet flush was weak, and there was dent on the side of the tub. They had a minibar, but no fridge. If you have a car, don't park at the hotel. There's only valet parking which costs $47 per day...ouch! On a positive note, the location was great, with shopping and restaurants nearby.	
Aug 6 2005 	it was ok...but..	stayed there for a conference. it was ok, nothing really impressive. the location is good, very convenient to BART and cable car, as well as the big shopping center. it is closed to the ferry building, where a very good market located. i got a room that the bay could be seen, the view was great. however, i do not like the room very much. the carpet was dirty and stained. they told me it's an non-smoking room; however, i could smell the smoke and some ash trays were provided!? the bathroom has bad lightening so that it looks not very bright. maybe that's why the bath tub did not look very clean. Worst of all, the water pressure was very low. it took me forever to wash my hair. Complained about it but nothing was done. if it's not for the conference (which i don't have to pay) i would have not stayed there.	
Aug 5 2005	Nice hotel and location	Stayed here for one night in July. Got the Hyatt Regency for $70 through Priceline. Had a bit of difficulty in finding the hotel (our fault because we didn't print out directions). Called ahead to request two beds since we are a party of four and non smoking. No problems with receiving our requests. There were tons of people checking in but the line moved very quickly. Beautiful atrium with glass elevators. I read this was the largest hotel atrium in the world. We were very surprised to get to our room and discover we were put in one that was handicapped accessible and only had a shower. I like tubs. We tried later to switch but were unable to because they were &quot;completely sold out&quot; and also had &quot;run out of rollaways.&quot; It was just weird that this was our second night in a row in a handicapped accessible room for accommodations that had been purchased through Priceline. We slept well however. Cannot put anything in the refrigerator as it is one of those electronically controlled models. If you wanted an empty one, the cost was $20. Staff was very nice especially the bellhops. Parking was very expensive - $48 a night with in and out privileges. Great location. Right across the street from a Walgreens, Starbucks and 7 Eleven. Would stay here again.	
Aug 1 2005 	Great Place	For a reasonable Priceline bid, I imagine most any traveler will be happy here. The hotel is sort of a large cement behemoth, with a lobby and atrium that feels very Disneyworld-like. Not a terribly &quot;personal hotel&quot; or quirky hotel, rather it's very corporate and efficient. My 12th floor room was clean, with a great view of the Bay Bridge. The bathroom wasn't terribly exciting and the water pressure's a little lax. I arrived around noon, after a cross-country trip. The hotel staff promptly checked me in. I loved being able to open my windows. The street below is loud, but you're in the middle of the Embarcadero.If paying full price, there are infinitely more &quot;classy,&quot; San Francisco-authentic hotels. Still, this was a terrific bargain in a city that's very pricey.	
Jul 28 2005	I love this hotel	My brother and I had a great stay at this hotel. The location is perfect: across from the Ferry Building with little shops and restaurants, literally 10 steps away from the trolley stop to Union Square, 2-minute walk to BART/ Muni station, only 15 minute walk to Chinatown or Union Square, safe location, and the list goes on and on. My flight arrived early in the morning, so I took a 20-minute BART ride from SFO and registered at the front desk. Kathleen checked me in and told me the room would be ready in a couple of hours. No problem, I had to pick up my brother at OAK anyway. I asked the bellstaff to keep my bag until I returned. Don't forget to ask for vouchers that offer 50% off your bill at the hotel restaurants; they won't give them to you if you don't ask. Check-in experience was flawless.We didn't want to pay additional $30/day for a partial-bay view room so we settled for a city view. Our room was on the 7th floor. The room is spacious with the usual accompaniments: 25&quot; TV, workdesk, coffeemaker, minibar. The minibar has a sensor that charges you automatically when you remove an item from it. If you move one item out to put in your own food, you'll be charged for that item. We asked housekeeping for extra pillows and hangers, they delivered them right away. The room has sliding doors that open up fully to give you fresh air and a view of the street down below. The traffic can be noisy but if the doors are closed you can sleep like a baby at night. About the pillows, yes, they are squishy. You can either bring your own pillow or just ask if housekeeping has extra pillows. Water pressure in the shower was a bit weak, but that didn't ruin our vacation.We didn't go to any of the restaurants in the hotel because we wanted to experience the city. The hotel's reception is on the third floor, which is a good idea because you don't have conference people on the street level going through your lobby. The fitness room on the second floor has 1 eliptical trainer, 2 stairmasters, 1 pull-up/dip station, 2 bikes, 2 treadmills, a dumbell station in the corner, some rolled yoga mats, a couple of bosu balls, a table with drinking water, and fresh towels. These machines face two TV's mounted on the wall. Very clean room and well-lit room but no view. You need your room key to enter and (the cool thing is) the door automatically unlocks itself as you leave the room. The room can be busy in the morning, as it was at 6:30am when I was there, but then at 7:15am the crowd was thinning.Concierge has all the info you need. You don't need to rent a car because of the hotel's proximity to all transportation transfer points, but if you do there is Budget Rental Car desk in the lobby. I think valet parking charges $10 the first hour, maximum of $26 per day. The atrium lobby is stunning, and the elevators provide a great view. You may ask for a room near the elevator, which what we got. Otherwise, the walk can be unbearable, even with the view of the lobby.There is Starbucks and Walgreens (who can develop 1-hour photos) across the street. There are cafes and bagel shops within 2-3 minutes walk. On Saturdays and Tuesdays from 11am to 2pm there is Farmer's Market at the Ferry Building, selling produce and lunches. Night Farmer's Market is on Thursdays.One thing to remember: to save water and energy, the hotel changes linens on your bed everytime they have new guests in the room, and every three days, unless you ask. So I asked housekeeping to change my bed sheets every day. To help them clean my room easier and faster, I put all dirty/used towels on the floor on one corner to be replaced. In return, I graciously left the housekeeper some tips for her hardwork.All of the staff, from housekeeping to bellstaff was very helpful and kind. All wake-up calls were done with a real person, and I appreciate their effort to pronounce my difficult last name. I got my rate from Priceline, which I thought I overpaid, but I will definitely recommend this hotel to everybody for this price. All five stars for location, staff, service, building design, and room.	
Jul 25 2005	Beautiful Hotel!	The Hyatt Regency San Francisco at Embarcadero Center is one of my all-time favorite hotels. My wife and I stayed there for 5 nights on our recent trip to San Francisco (July 2005).I got a little annoyed when we first checked in, because the front desk told us that all rooms with two double beds were sold out (even though I reserved the room in advance online). But they did give us a free upgrade to a suite with a large balcony, which turned out to be nice, so we were both very satisfied.The atrium of this hotel is absolutely beautiful, and the glass elevators add a nice touch. On the top floor is a 360 degree revolving restaurant called, The Equinox. My wife and I ended two of the 5 nights we stayed there at The Equinox and split a bottle of champagne both times.The only cons at this hotel are the pillows for the beds. They're the 'squishy' kind where you can feel your hand on your head through the pillow when you sleep sideways. (The best sleep that I ever got in any hotel was at the Sheraton Biscayne Bay in Miami.)The bottom line - Definitely stay at this hotel if you can get a room for less than $200/night (not including taxes), but bring your own pillows.I would definitely stay at the Hyatt Regency San Francisco again.	
Jul 17 2005	Just Okay	We just returned from San Francisco and stayed for 3 nights at the Hyatt. We were surprised that this hotel has a 4-star rating from AAA. It doesn't deserve it! The Hyatt rooms are old and just average. The bathroom only had a toilet and shower in it--with the sink located outside of the bathroom--something you would definitely find in a cheaper hotel chain. If you can tolerate the hotel room, there are some good things about the location. The cable car, BART, Muni and F-line trolley car are right outside your door. If you are lucky, you may get a room with an outside view. Also, the breakfast buffet was quite good and included in our AAA room rate.	
Jul 17 2005	SF Hyatt Regency Was great	Got a terrific deal on Hotwire and was really pleased with this hotel. Excellent location and services. Staff was friendly and helpful and my room with a view of the Bay was nice and spacious. Valet parking at $50 a day was pretty stiff but you can park next door for $27 a day (without in-and-out provleges.)	
Jul 12 2005 	Nice view but fair overall	I stayed at the Hyatt for a conference for 4 days and was not at all impressed for the pretty high group rate we were paying. Minuses: rooms are pretty small, bed was extremely uncomfortable, tiny bathrooms(showers don't even compare to Holiday Inn Express for instance), rooms and overall hotel were not very clean, decor is outdated and the fare was just that, fair. Not all what you would expect from a Hyatt or comparable chain. Pluses: Helpful concierge and valet attendants, having a club level room that was on a higher floor, a small but nice balcony, and the view of the bay. From other attendees at my conference I was extremely lucky to garner a room with a nice view, even on the club level, as most were said to be very limited. I would not come back to this hotel for pleasure.	
Jul 11 2005	Good Location	Location is right off the BART station and start of California street cable car. Room is clean and spacious. Never any line up at the registration. Staff is polite and helpful.Downside : internet is $10/day and phone call is $1 each. Fridge is controlled by computer for usage of drinks and cannot be used for personal stuff.	
Jul 7 2005	Great Hotel	Purchased room through priceline. Found hotel to be nice, comfortable, and above average. Check-in was a breeze and front desk employees were very helpful. I wouldn't really consider this the &quot;Union Square&quot; area...a nice 20 minute walk, but it is a great location for picking up a trolley, bus, etc. from right in front of hotel. Embacadero Center has shops and restuarants for those who do not want to venture far from hotel.	
Jul 6 2005	Disappointed in the Hyatt...	My boyfriend and I stayed at the Hyatt Regency. He wanted to stay at the Hyatt because of the revolving restaurant, Equinox. I wanted to stay in a suite at one of the more smaller hotels (boutique) or even the Omni. The room was small and the bay view was very limited. Also, although we had reservations, when we arrived we only had a choice of the second floor or the 8th floor, which was the smoking floor. The hotel's lobby is huge and beautiful, but they truly did not splurge on the rooms. The reception stated that the hotel caters to conventions and that is exactly what it felt like. The BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT, however was the hefty valet parking (there is no self parking). Parking per night was $41.00 plus a tax, which ended up being almost $50.00. For a three night stay it cost us $147.00 total for parking alone. My next stay will NOT be at the Hyatt Regency with all of the other hotels available.	
Jul 1 2005 	Nice hotel great location	The Hyatt Regency San Francisco is a nice hotel. It's very pricey-- not as much for the quality of the room, but for the location. It is right at the beginning of one of the cable car lines, has a stop for the buses that take you to Fisherman's Wharf right outside, and has stunning bay views. There is a Starbucks and a Walgreen's, right across the street as well as an infinate number of restaurants within walking distance. It is right next door to Embarcadero Center... a retail shopping mall that spans 4 blocks. We stayed here because my husband was attending a conference at the Hyatt. The room was nice. They offered ammenities like shampoo, soap, and conditioner, but no lotion or other &quot;extras&quot;. I have yet to stay at a hotel that had a clean shower/tub. This was no different. There was hair in the tub when we got there. We liked the daily newspaper and the concierge was helpful with public transportation and restaurant suggestions. If you're visiting soon, go see Les Miserables. It is a phenomenal show playing at the Curran Theatre. We paid $210/night.... I never would've paid that much for the Hyatt myself, but we were reimbursed by my husband's company.	
Jul 1 2005	Marginal at Best	We just returned from 3 nights at the Hyatt Regency at Embarcadero and we feel that the property is in dire need of a facelift. The room was warm and comfortable, however, the lobby and the atrium were extremely drab and dreary. The location is central to Fisherman's Wharf, Pier 39 and Union Square, easily within walking distance or if you prefer, public transportation was easily accessible. We have stayed in upscale hotels in the past and this fell well below the bar.	
Jun 26 2005	Better than we thought	This hotel had a great location for being able to walk around the Embarcadero and on down to Fisherman's Wharf. We walked from the hotel to and from the SF Giants game down at SBC Park. Hotel itself was roomy although had a rather small toilet/shower area. We could open our window to get a fresh breeze from the bay but streets below were very loud. With the windows closed, the room was very quiet. Front desk personnel couldn't have been more efficient. We found none of the problems that previous reviewers had written about the hotel. We were quite pleased for the $75 we spent on PriceLine.	
Jun 21 2005	Big problem with Hyatt	I recently stayed at the Hyatt in SF in may for 1 night, the Hotel was quite nice and the room was nice with a great view of SF bay, but I just found out today that I got double booked. I reserved my room on priceline for a great price, 85$ tax included, but I ust noticed on my bank statement that the Hyatt charged my credit card for 108$, which includes parking, this is absolutely outrageous, and I'm in the process of getting this charge removed, I liked the hotel itself but I'm just giving everone a warning about the practices of the Hyatt chain, as they seem to be crooks just out to get your money.	
Jun 19 2005	Great value	My family of four just returned from a trip to SF. The Hyatt Regency was at a terrific location (across from the Ferry building) and adjacent to any kind of transportation you could imagine! We were in Chinatown in minutes via the cable car (which was never crowded at our location!). Other tourists waited a couple of hours to ride at other locations, and we got on and off in minutes on our line. After hoofing around the city for a week with two little ones, I can tell you that location is a priority in the city. We even took BART straight to our hotel from the airport. The ride is less than $5 per person and was safe and fast. The hotel itself is huge, and the staff was attentive and hard-working. The lobby is cavernous and the style reminds me a bit of Disney's Contemporary in Orlando. The bar has a super view of the harbor and is quiet and relaxing. We didn't dine at Equinox because our children were so young, but we went upstairs and admired the view from the revolving restaurant. The menu looked delicious! The room was standard and quiet. Staying near Fisherman's wharf would have been much noisier. We got the room at $90 a night through Priceline, and I heard from other travelers that our price was steal for a room in SF in the summer. We'd recommend the Hyatt again.	
Jun 8 2005	Needs a little work	We got this hotel through Priceline. The rooms were comfortable and the location was adequate but there were definitely some (minor) issues with our stay.First, the good. The hotel is very striking when you first arrive. The decor of the rooms is good. We really liked our beds. We ate at the bar the first night we arrived and although we thought it was a bit pricey at first we were pleased with the portions provided.The bad. The hyatt tries to come off as this upscale hotel, but really they are trying to pinch every penny they can out of you. The mini bar is computerized, so if you try to move things around (i.e. put something of your own in there) you will automatically be charged. We didn't know this and had been moving things around all night. The next morning we saw the tiny notice on the mini fridge and called the front desk. Thankfully, they removed the charges. If you want to use the fridge for yourself it is a $10 charge. Also there are no vending machines because they want you to take the overpriced products in the minifridge. This was a bit annoying.Next issue was that our coffee maker was broken. It took over an hour for someone to come and replace it. The hotel is located on the edge of the embarcadero right across from the Ferry Building. It is a bit of a walk to most sights, but if you don't mind a walk it is not too big of a deal. There are bus stops right at the corner. If I were to go back to SF I would probably look for a different part of town to stay in as this is the Financial District and dead after dark. Still, a good deal for Priceline.	
Jun 7 2005	Great location everything else was so-so	We stayed at the Hyatt Regency SF on the Embarcadero from 5/27 to 5/31. We were not too impressed for the price we paid. We had 3 rooms as there were 7 in our party; however one had to sleep on a chair and lounge as they didn't have any queen rooms. I had called a month ago to request 2 beds in at least 1 room, so that was a little disappointing. The location of the hotel could not be any better. You walk out the door and there is the F line, Cable Car and Bart/Muni station. Our complaints internet access is $9.95 per day. But my problem is this. My laptop has a satellite internet connection so where ever I am I can connect. Well, at this hotel they block all other internet connections. So although I pay to be able to have a connection available to me anywhere, they feel the privilege to block my service provider to me. Do they block cell phone connections so you have to use their telephones? No. So why internet? Also, they attempted to charge us $80 for the Continental Breakfast that came with our room package and it was like pulling teeth for them to cancel the charges. The bar is well understaffed as not one group of guests that would sit down for a drink would be served within 15 minutes of arriving. Finally, we just went down the street. Also, they need to make an effort to not let the homeless pester their guests. I understand once you hit the sidewalk it is their right, but each time wed walk out the door, under the covered valet driveway, we were hit up for money, and once yelled at in profanities. The hotel does seem a little older, I think because of all the concrete and the dusty fake greenery in the lobby and along the floors. As far as the rooms, the linens werent great. Ive had duvets at 3 star hotels, but not here. The thin scratchy comforter was awful. Concierge was extremely hard to get a hold of. Most the time wed just visit them on the way out of the hotel as they never answered the phone.While Ive touched on all of the negative, the Hyatt was not THAT bad. It is just not what we had hoped for being a Hyatt. And for the price, we really shouldnt have had any complaints.Best feature: LocationWorst feature: Attentiveness to service	
Jun 7 2005	Awesome location!	An awesome location with great views of the bay! Located next to BART, Cable Cars, Steet Cars (F-line takes you right to FW), buses. Across the street from the Ferry Building-great little shops and farmer's market on Saturday.Some have given this hotel a negative review but I found it to be very clean, quiet and comfortable. The hotel service (front desk, concierge, housekeeping) very friendly and helpful. I would definitely stay here again. The location is outstanding for touring SF.	
May 24 2005 	Adequate Service	Check in was as smooth as can be. Conference space was great. Concierge helped with booking Alacatraz. Trying to get a hold of the Equinox restaurant on Sunday evening for a reservation was difficult. No one answered the phone and it went to a recording. I called the Concierge and they did not answer after 6 rings. I called the front desk who did answer on the first ring and was glad to transfer to the Maitre'D who answered on the second ring and called me by name and room number. Very frustrating.The rooms seem to be old and need to be updated.	
May 19 2005	Great!	After a 14 hour flight from the UK, it was great to arrive at a hotel like this. All the staff were very friendly, the room was fab and we even had views of the bay. Room service was also very good! I can highly recommend this hotel.	
May 17 2005	Very Nice Experience	The Hyatt Regency is located on a great spot right across from the San Francisco Ferry Terminal. We came in to town for the infamous Bay to Breakers event, we chose to stay at the Hyatt as it was literally steps away from the start line. We had a very spacious and well-appointed room with a balcony that looked out over the bay as well as some courtyards and modern art pieces. The hotel is also conveniently located right at a BART station (runs directly to SFO airport) and at a cable car station.We had never stayed on the Embarcadero before, but we found it to be quite pleasant. It's not as happening as North Beach or Union Street or some other parts of town, but there were several good restaurants in the area and it was easy and pleasant to walk around the Embarcadero area.We had a very reasonable corporate rate, otherwise this might have been a bit more than we were looking to spend for this trip. But the service, location and room quality definitely exceeded our expectations.	
May 14 2005	Not up to Hyatt standards	We were greatly disappointed in the Hyatt Regency Embarcadero. The location was good, and the front desk staff was friendly, but the hotel facilities desperately need updating and cleaning! There was a ring of dust around the entire room perimeter. They had to send a special cleaner to vacuum for us as the regular housekeeping staff doesn't clean edges! The blanket binding was torn and the towels were old, stiff and worn out.	
Apr 29 2005	Worth the value! We had a wonderful stay!	Stayed here for 4 nights with my husband last week from Apr 20 -Apr.24. Pretty good deal considering what we paid for! We bid from priceline, $75 per night plus tax and fees. The front desk people are really nice. Got 4 50% off coupon for any Hyatt restaurant in San Francisco when we checked in. Got a partial Bay view room (we called them up after we bid for the hotel) without surcharge. The room is big and designed clever and very clean.Talk about the location, it's not as great as Union square hotels, but it's really convenient to take any public transportation to anywhere you want. We took BART from airport to the hotel, it took us 40 minutes and we got there around 8:20pm local time ($4.95 per person). We had one big luggage and 2 small carry on's. The hotel is right at exit of Bart. We did have problem with the public transportation on weekend though. Some MUNI won't stop in front of the hotel on weekends. We ended up to take street car (F line) to union square then catch bus there to go to Japan Town for the cherry blossom festival. You can take F street car directly go to Fishermen Whart!The ferry building is the best. I had the freshest oyster there and other delicious home made food. The price of the goods was kind of high although we didn't plan to ship farm goods home.We loved Alcatraz island trip and beach blanket babylon's show! 3 days kind of short for me but it's enough for my husband since he hates seafood and the sour flour bread is kind of hard to chew for him.:)) They do have good Italian food, Chinese food. But we only went to those famous seafood place 'cause back home you will never find anything like those. Hope next time still stay here if we can get a deal like this on priceline again! :))	
Apr 21 2005 	Not in the centre of the action	I stayed here for one Saturday night. Shuttle van from the airport stopped here first, took about 30 minutes from the airport. Location isn't ideal, to get to Union square/Chinatown its quite a walk (15 mins) or two stops on the Bart/Muni. Starbucks across the road and a Croissant shop for breakfast. Hotel has wireless lan (chargeable) but my PC found a network that was free (although I had to hold laptop near the window). Would stay nearer Union Sq/Fishermans Wharf next time.	
Apr 14 2005	Great Stay - Perfect Location	My fiance and I stayed at the Hyatt April 7th-11th. We went to San Francisco to see the sights and were not in our room except to sleep. For that purpose the Hyatt was wonderful. The location could not have been better, the BART, cable car, and the Street Cars are literally right outside the front door. The Ferry Building on the Embarcadaro was right across the street. You had transportation to where ever you wanted to go. We got our room from Priceline for $90/night and was well worth it. We did not eat or drink at any of the restaurants because we wanted to experience San Francisco and that was easy to do because of the location.	
Apr 11 2005 	No Complaints	Nice, if somewhat dated hotel. It was sold to me as a 4-star hotel, but it is kind of a 4-star minus (or a 3-star double-plus). Whether you are traveling on business or pleasure, though, the location is terrific. Cable cars and BART are both outside the door. Rooms are not cramped and certainly adequate, but nothing beyond above average. Staff was fine. Nice, if simple, exercise room with newer CV equipment and ample dumbells. If you are paying &gt;$200, you may be disappointed. If you get a deal through Priceline or Hotwire, you likely will be pleased.	
Mar 31 2005	Great Stay!	My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights this month (March, 2005). The king/non-smoking room on the 17th floor was large, clean, and comfortable. We used priceline to get the room and were very happy with the price we paid. We liked the room and the hotel and would happily stay there again. There were Muni stops in several areas, right around the hotel, so it was easy to catch the street cars, buses, etc. The hotel is in the financial center, which means it's not in the heart of the tourist district. We did do a lot of walking, but that was our choice. Because of the hotel's location, there were many choices for breakfasts and lunches, but dinner options were harder to be found. This wasn't a big problem since we were usually out sight-seeing anyway and not near the hotel at that time. We also found some pizza places that delivered right to the room when we wanted to stay in for the evening.The room itself had a king bed, desk/table with 2 chairs, another chair with ottoman, and the TV armoire. The bathroom had the shower/tub/toilet in one room with the sink/vanity area outside of this. It was easy for two people to use both spaces at the same time, although it was a little tight when we were both in front of the mirror at the same time. There was a mini-bar in the room, which we did not use. The hotel offers the option of cleaning out the mini-bar and allowing guests to use it as their refrigerator for a $10.00 fee. When we called down from the room to request this option, they brought up another refrigerator instead and never charged us the fee!Our room was along an inside hallway, with a city view. The view wasn't so hot--it just looked out at another skyscraper. The room was quiet, however, because it did not overlook the atrium area of the hotel. We did hear the bells from the street cars, but this did not last very late into the night so sleeping wasn't a problem. Housekeeping did a nice job with cleaning the room each day, and overall, we had no complaints. We also found the staff to be friendly and helpful and enjoyed our stay!	
Mar 28 2005	Great location and great hotel	I just returned from a 3 nights stay at the Hyatt Regency and I have no idea why this place is getting bad reviews! I do a ton of leisure traveling and I loved this place. The hotel itself is beautiful with an amazing lobby and a GREAT lobby bar (13 views) wut an equally great happy hour! We stayed on water side and had a OK view but the room was terrific. Two comfortable double beds, LOTS of room, and a nice bathroom with a seperate area to get ready in. Nice layout. The best part had to be the location. You are right next to the Embarcadero Ferry Station that has lots of cute shops. Also right on the F-line to Fisherman's wharf, easy ride for $1.25 and right on the California Cable Car line $3, as well as right by the BART system. There are breakfast places right outside of the hotel to grab a quick bite before your meeting or site seeing. I would stay at the Hyatt again in a minute.	
Mar 16 2005	Fantastic Lobby	I love this hotel. It is a fantastic design, in a sort of ugly 70s way. Anyone who has not been in it before will have trouble visualizing the lobby; but it is a wonderful treat just to walk in. The entire floor is open, and goes up all 17 floors in a pyramid shape. Every floor is a ring around the lobby, and has a balcony ourside the room looking down on it. Every room also has a window on the outside, and there are no inside rooms, so there are no rooms without views.The staff is friendly but not overly attentive, and you get the feeling that anything you need can be taken care of (this is helped by the prominant concierge desk).There is a resturant and a bar in the lobby, and both serve the same food (as does room service). The bar, &quot;The 13 Views&quot; is a lovely place for a quiet drink, and features a good beer selection as well as some exotic mixed drinks. The prices are not outragous for a hotel bar, and the enviroment is very nice, with comfortable chairs and couches. About half of the bar is in the open lobby, and half under an overhang looking out on the Justin Herman plaza.There is another resturant, the Equinox, which is a rotating fine dining restaurant at the very top of the hotel. I did not go in during my stay because it got some pretty poor reviews on the internet.Overall, I very much enjoyed my stay. This hotel while perhaps a little bit further from Union Square than some might like, offers a relaxing retreat, and is a sight to be seen unto itself. I hightly recommend staying here.	
Mar 16 2005	Overpriced and overrated	I stayed at the Hyatt Regency Embarcadero for five nights while I attended a conference. The location and surrounding area is great - very scenic, safe and transportation very accessible.I found the Hotel to be of poor quality including atmosphere, linens, and bedding. The room was very noisy with street noise - the sliding glass door seemed poorly sealed. While the staff was helpful, the quality of the facility was hardly worth the price. There is absolutely nothing at the Hyatt Regency Embarcadero that provides any chance for relaxation or enjoyment. While the food was adequate it was completely overpriced.I've stayed at other Hyatt facilities and always found them to be very nice and well worth the price, so $200/night was an astronomical amount for a less than average facility	
Feb 27 2005 	Not worth the price..	Stayed there for 3 nights with my wife. Nothing special or impressive. Very expensive compared to general quality. The main problem is; the hotel is too noisy. Noises come from; the atrium, the street, the heater, adjacent rooms, corridor, everywhere !!.. The rooms are quite cold in winter since the very wide glass windows (I should say glass wall). You can turn on the air conditioner to heat the room, but this time you get all the noises of hissing and squeaking. In summary; not worth the price, not worth the Hyatt title..	
Dec 28 2004	I love the SF Hyatt Regency	I stay in hotels in San Francisco often, and I enjoy the SF Hyatt Regency the most. I want to say right off the bat that this assumes I have a king room, bay view with balcony -- which IMHO is absolutely worth the price to upgrade. (I'm a Hyatt Gold Passport member, and I have had very good luck getting upgraded.)I find the architecture of the hotel fascinating and the somewhat &quot;Zen&quot; rooms extremely comfortable and efficient. I love hanging out on my balcony in the evening, or watching the boats and world go by in the daytime. Any service or store you could ever want is in either the Embarcadero shops or the Ferry Building marketplace....and all these places are used by locals so you are plunked down in the middle of a part of real San Francisco...not a tourist area per se.BART, the Cable Car, and a host of other public transportation options are right at your doorstep.I also like the level of service I have received here. It's not overly intimate and personal, but that's fine with me.Big Exception: I hate paying $38 for Valet parking. It seems like a crime.	
Dec 15 2004	Great Location!	Definitely not as bad as some of the reviews said. Location was fantastic, although the music from the ice rink was annoying at times. Lucky to have had a 2nd floor room overlooking the embarcadero, Oakland Bay Bridge, Ferry Bldg and the Bay. Great rate through Priceline, otherwise this is just a large convention hotel. Yep, the room and bathroom was somewhat small but you couldn't beat the view. I don't think I would have liked the hotel though, if we had another room. There wasn't much character to it. The revolving restaurant upstairs was cozy and perfect for evening cocktails. The hotel gives you soap, shampoo and conditioner...that's it. You need to request a refrigerator for personal use. The mini bar clearly states it is not for personal use and you will be charged. The Farmer's Market at the Ferry Building was out of this world. The Bart and cable cars are all within one block. Walgreen's and deli's are all over the place if you need &quot;stuff&quot;.	
Dec 9 2004	There are plenty of other hotels in San Francisco	This hotel is in a good location: next to the outdoor ice skating rink, the cable car picks up right there to go to Union Square, and the street car can take you to the Embarcadero. That's where my favorable review ends. The room we had was dark and cave-like, with a partial view of the ice skating rink, which plays loud music until 10:30 p.m. When we ordered dessert from room service we were told the delicious photos we were looking at and ordering from were no longer available. We settled on chocolate ice cream and 20 minutes later vanilla showed up. The room service staff went to fetch chocolate and called us to inform us that chocolate was all sold out. Not a big deal, I know...but how can you sell out of chocolate ice cream?? My husband and I decided to slip down to the bar (great views if you can snag a sofa by the windows) and 30 minutes went by before anyone came to take our drink order. The place was half full. I wouldn't return to this hotel, even considering the good deal we got.	
Nov 23 2004	Great Location/Rate	Stayed here at the end of September. Got a $105 rate from Hotwire, a real bargain for SF. Great location by BART and MUNI, Ferry Bldg. The room was clean and comfortable - what one would expect from Hyatt. I did not use any of the facilities or eat any meals in the hotel. Lots of dining options in Ferry Bldg., and Harbor Village (Chinese dim sum restaurant) is next door in the Embarcadero Center.	
Nov 11 2004	So So	Stayed there for four nights in early November during the Hotel workers strike. Was woken up at 6 AM every day (even though we were on the 15th floor!) by striking (or locked out) workers with drums and airhorns. Luckily I am from the East Coast so was used to getting up early. Even with the strike and reduced workforce the service at the hotel was very good and did not notice a drop off which is a credit to those that were working the double shifts. THe hotel itself is a very nice hotel with a beautiful and very, very large atrium with numerous places to sit and relax, have a drink or do some work. The location is right along the Embarcadero waterfront by the Farmer's Market/Ferry Building with views of the Bay Bridge. Pier 39 and Fisherman's wharf are a nice walk/street car ride to the north while the Union Square shopping district is just a mile or less up market street (again can be walked in 20 minutes or you can take the subway, bus or trolley car). China Town is close too. We did not have a car (parking is $45 per day) and never needed one with plentiful modes of transportation. The rooms are very nice and large for hotel rooms with a unique angle to them. Food choices are plentiful for all meals and there is a Walgreens right across the street for those items you might have left at home. The big drawbacks are noise from the city is heard throughout the night even with ear plugs and the fan on. The walls are pretty thin as we could always hear the neighbors TV until late at night. Finally, be careful with the wet bars. Everytime you open it even to look in it you get charged. I kept my own water and milk in there and had $80 worth of refreshment charges on my bill that I had to fight to get taken off.	
Oct 30 2004	Cavernous and lacks character	If all you want is a bed for the night, and you get a good deal from Priceline, and you don't mind staying in a cavernous, characterless place that specializes in mega-conventions, and for some reason you're wowed by a pointlessly large atrium -- then by all means, go for it!I think with a bit of effort, there are probably better, more memorable places to stay in SF.	
Oct 8 2004	horrible experience	We stayed there from sept 27 to oct 3. The hotel staff started striking about middle of our stay which we understand not much can be done by the hotel staff. However, the 2nd day after strike began, we found our room door opened/unlocked when we got back in the evening, after being gone from 8 am!! We called front desk right away and the guy did not even apologize!! Just said &quot;room service had a rough day, as you know, because of the strike&quot;!! They did call security and they apologized but they said there's nothing they can do?! Luckily my luggages were still in the room. You would think that security is basic at all hotels and we are talking about Hyatt....will NOT recommend at all!	
Sep 24 2004	OK	Nothing special. We stayed at the Orchard, then switched to the Hyatt. The Orchard Hotel blew the Hyatt out of the water. The Hyatt, I thought, was nothing special. The room was small, and the bedspread was gross and 'old' looking.	
Sep 14 2004	Cool Atrium	Wouldn't stay here on my own dime. The atrium/lobby is a remrkable feature but nothing else worth the price, unless you get a good view. My eighth floor view to the south wasn't much. Some wrote $42/day to park. I paid $28 in June. Couldn't get the local sports station in my room to watch an A's game so I went to the bar and they didn't get it there either. The bartender could hardly understand what I wanted and had to surf the channels to see if he got it. Pretty lame for a high priced joint.	
Sep 8 2004	Great location 	Stayed over the Labor Day weekend and found everything neat, clean and well run.Rooms have balconies and mine gave a beautiful view of Telegraph Hill! The hotel only offers valet parking at about 45$, but next door at the Embacadero Center you can get public parking for 27$ per day.	
Sep 7 2004	Labor Day Weekend Retreat	Spent the night before Labor Day at the Hyatt Regency San Francisco in the Embarcadero Center. Got a good rate of $82 plus hotel taxes,etc. We stayed in a tenth floor room facing the Ferry Building and with a nice view of the bay. The room had a king size bed, desk, overstuffed chair with an ottoman and still lots of room. Used Trip Advisor to find an excellent restaurant (Pacific Catch on Chestnut &amp; Fillmore). If you stay on Sundays or Holidays the street parking is free which saves you a good piece of change. The Ferry Building had several restaurants which seemed to be bustling with activity. You can use the Muni bus lines to get to most places. Just call them and tell them where you are and where you're going.	
Jul 1 2004 	Excellent	Good experience and will return. I upgraded to business floor and had a wonderful room and access to wireless and a printer. The Equinoc restaurant had good food and a super view. Check in was easy and staff was accommodating. Close to number of good restaurants.	
Jun 6 2004	SF Goes Vegas	This hotel is like Vegas with crazy carpet prints and a huge feel. Rooms are well kept and very nice. This Hyatt has good specials and rates throughout the year. Its location is a bit removed and the largeness turns me off a bit. Many rooms have large balconies with furniture a nice feature	
May 30 2004	A Good Value	We stayed at the Hyatt Regency - San Francisco (at Embarcadero Center) two nights in mid-May. We got an excellent senior citizen rate. The room was comfortable with an outstanding view of the Bay Bridge and the newly redone Ferry Building.As others have noted the bathroom area was a bit small compared to most Hyatts.Note that this is a convention hotel, so you may have to contend with large groups. As with many San Francisco hotels, parking is very expensive.The food in the main hotel restaurant was very good, but prices were high. Fortunately, with the revitalization of the Ferry Building and the surrounding Embarcadero area there are a number of dining opportunities nearby.	
Apr 24 2004	Skip this Hyatt in San Fran	We were forewarned about the expensive valet parking at the Hyatt (approx $42 with tax per day), so that was a known negative. But the room was dated, the hallways lining the atrium included dusty, disheveled fake greenery, and the service was lousy. No friendly faces. Personnel seemed to have the &quot;This IS the Hyatt&quot; mentality, which was very unwelcoming. We were charged mini-bar charges electronically because we added something to the fridge (charges were dropped when we complained). Had to request additional towels and coffee. WAY overrated and overpriced. Will never stay at a Hyatt again. The ony positive thing was the cable car stopped right in front of the hotel, which was convenient for touring.	
Apr 13 2004	Perfect Vacation Hotel	I recently stayed at the Hyatt Regency in San Francisco. What i found was a pleasant atmosphere with an even friendlier staff. The room was spacious enough for my husband and I as well as our yougest son, who thoroughly enjoyed the view from the room. We were also able to enjoy breakfast in the restaurant before a long day on the town- all conveniently located within walking distance from the hotel.	
Mar 11 2004	Average Hotel Great Staff	The price of the hotel was about $250. The room had a great view and was in a convenient location. But the room wasn't anything special for the price I paid. The best part of the hotel was the staff. They were helpful with the many questions I had about get from the hotel to the various tourist destinations.	
Mar 5 2004	Just okay...	We stayed at the Hyatt Regency San Francisco from February 29 March 3. The room was very spacious with a great bay view. Even though we were on the fourth floor, the noise from the street was not disturbing. Front desk and concierge staff were both very helpful. The hotel is great for meetings and conventions (our reason for staying) but a little far from the Union Square area (still in walking distance though). Shops and restaurants within the Embarcadero Center close early enough for it to be inconvenient. There are few places to grab a dinner after 6 pm other than the hotel restaurant which charges exorbitant prices for room service (i.e. $4 for a glass of milk). The open concept lobby is impressive with the numerous glass elevators. The bed and pillows were not overly comfortable but the room was extremely functional. I especially appreciated the armchair and automan in the room. The sliding door is a nice touch but there were pigeons on our balcony so we never kept it open. The bathroom was clean but a little run-down definitely not what I was expecting from a Hyatt. One small complaint they showed the Oscars on a big screen in the lobby. Because it is open concept, we could hear the telecast in our rooms! If I were returning to San Francisco as a tourist, I wouldn't stay at this hotel there are much better deals closer to Union Square or Fisherman's Wharf. However, for a conference/meeting or business within the Financial District, the hotel was very conveniently located.
