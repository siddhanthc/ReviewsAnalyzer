	Wonderful Hotel Will Definately Stay Here Again	I was completely satisfied with this hotel. My room was amazing, I loved the kitchen area complete with a fridge, microwave, stove, and dishwasher. Everything was spotless clean and I loved the huge bathroom. The location was quite nice (only a ten minute walk from the heart of downtown) and Harry Carey's and House of Blues was across the street. Staff was kind and helpful. Free breakfast, evening appetizers, and evening drinks were excellent bonuses. I WILL be staying here again!	
Nov 24 2009 	Outstanding	Never before have we had such a wonderful experience in a hotel. We brought our dog with us on this trip and from the moment we arrived we were greeted very warmly and the staff bent over backwards to help us with the dog crate, luggage, helping us to our room, etc. Our dog received so much attention from not only the staff, but the other residents who wanted to pet and coo over her. The rooms were very comfortable and sound proof. We also appreciated the fact that the hotel is very secure - have to use your pass key in the elevator to get to your floor. There were also patches of grass just a block and a half away from the hotel for our dog to relieve herself. It just happened to be next to the Chicago Fire Department, which made us feel very safe. We went to Chicago to see The Addams Family. We walked to dinner at Harry Carrey's (one block away) and the Oriental Theatre (just seven blocks away). No cabs needed. Also, we walked to Whole Foods (about seven blocks). We will definitely come back again and bring our dog. Oh by the way, the hotel does charge a $100 non-refundable pet fee, but it was worth it.	
Nov 15 2009 	An Amazing Hotel in the Heart of Chicago	I booked a room for this hotel and got a great online rate. Since the rate was so low I did not expect much from this hotel and was worried because I turned down a popular (but expensive) 4 star hotel to stay here...I was completely wrong. First off this is a brand new hotel which means new sheets,furniture,kitchen,bathroom,lobby etc. The rooms were extremely clean, spacious, and impressive. I went during the middle of the week so not only did I receive a free hot breakfeast buffet in the morning, but a free dinner buffet at night,and to be honest the selection and food was excellent. The hotel also had free wifi in lobby and room, and also a free business center in case you forgot your laptop. They have an exercise room, pool and hot tub on the top floor overlooking the city (perfect after a long day). The one aspect of the hotel that stood out the most was the amazing service and friendliness of the employees. Each morning I was greeted, when I came back they welcomed me,when I needed help they knew exactly where everything was, when I needed extra towels and sheets it came to the door in less than 2 minutes!! This hotel makes most marriot hotels I stayed in seem like 2 star hotels.Each hotel I stay in I can find at lest one con (even if it is minor) but this hotel was 100% perfect! I will only stay at this hotel in Chicago, even if the rate is double of what I paid.	
Oct 31 2009 	A great hotel value and location served by a friendly and courteous staff.	Our son's entry into the Chicago Marathon presented the opportunity for a short visit to Chicago. A four day reservation was arranged cheerfully and without difficulty. Our arrival through O'Hare International two days prior to the marathon gave adequate time to settle-in and to gain a perspective on hotel facilities and navigation around the city. Catching the train from O'Hare delivered us within three blocks from our hotel. The hotel proved to be an ideal location as a launch pad for touring the city and for short foot-bound excursions to many nearby attractions. The hotel is within blocks of ground transportation and was a short distance to many critical waypoints along the marathon route. When coming &quot;home&quot; to the hotel we always received a friendly and courteous greeting from the hotel staff. Room service was equally cordial and helpful. The rooms were spacious and sparkling clean. The hotel's breakfast buffets were great as were the extended facilities. We would recommend this hotel to family and friends and will return at our earliest convenience.	
Oct 21 2009 	Great for families great location great service !	Arrived from Minneapolis on Thu Oct 15 and left on Sun Oct 18.We were able to have the &quot;social hour&quot; dinner on Thursday (only served M-TH 1800-1930). Nothing special, self serve buffet style, salad, Grille chck breast sandwich, brown beans, chips and brownies. All served with pop, water, wine or beer. It was nice to save some money on not going out to eat and after the trip and some sightseeing we were ready for an early dinner and time at the indoor pool (27th floor).Our kids (6 and 8) loved the pool and hot tub. Not too crowded and with great views. The included breakfast was also great: make your own waffles, sausage, potatoes, eggs, cereal, fruit, coffee, juices, yogurt, etcThe service from the hotel staff was 5 stars. Everyone really does his/her best to make your stay enjoyable. Upon checking, we were given a bottle of wine and some chips when during the conversation came up the fact that it was our weeding anniversary that weekend! Nice gesture.The location could not be better. Close to the CTA system. We rode cabs as for 4 people most rides were only $10.00. CTA buying single passes it would have been $7.00, so no brainer.The room was spacious. I was worried about some comments I heard about not having space with the pull out sofa out, but there is still a good 3 feet of space between the bed and the pull out bed. It was not an issue for us. It was great having the microwave (there is free mwave popcorn provided, next to the coffee packets), the full fridge is sooo convenient (we brought a cooler full of snacks). Full dishwasher, sink, silverware and dinnerware for four, and a 2 burner stove (no oven).We had lots of room to stretch out, the furniture was confy, we never felt crowded.We stayed on the 24th floor and city noise was not an issue other than the occasional siren from an emergency vehicle or the occasional honk. Never heard anything at night.Very happy with the room, service, location and price.Parking at $45.00/night is std. price for Chi Hotel. 1 block West there is a self park at 1/2 the price which is what I did.Free wi-fi everywhere, lobby, room, dining area, etcOur rate was $139.00/night during this stay.I will try hard to get this hotel again next time we are in Chicago. For families, because the extra space and all else mentioned above, it is a no brainer.Hope this helps the next person researching this great hotel.Diego	
Oct 20 2009 	Love it Love it Love it	This is the second year in a row my girlfriend and I have stayed here. We just love it, awesome location for shopping, restaurants and bars. We get the 2 bedroom so we both have our privacy and more then enough room with fantastic views of the city. We used to stay at the Residence Inn on Walton which was ok, but this is soooo much better..newer and better location to get to everything. We will be back next year!!!	
Oct 19 2009 	Best hotel for the price in downtown Chicago	We arrived in Chicago and stayed the first night in Hilton Garden Inn and was not impressed at all. The next day we went to Residence Inn and it was the total opposite experience. The staff was extremely pleasant and helpful. Even though they were extremly busy they worked fast and efficiently to get everyone to their rooms. The room was spotless and everything was just so cozy and comfortable. The kitchenette is so great to have because Chicago has some great places to eat and you can bring your food back to store and reheat it. The bed was comfortable and the chaise lounge was even better to just kick your feet upon. I would recommend this hotel for the staff, price, location and cleanliness anyday.	
Oct 19 2009 	Great Hotel in Chicago	The Residence Inn Chicago Downtown/River North was beautifully decorated in an Art Deco sty.e. There was a comfortable sitting and business area in the lobby. Each suite had a kitchen with a dining table, living room area and separate bedroom with bathroom. The free breakfasts included delicious waffles. The hotel is located near many excellent restaurants and within walking distance to the Magnificent Mile. Travel was easy to museums, shopping and other venues. I highly recommend this wonderful hotel if you plan to stay in downtown Chicago.	
Oct 14 2009 	Great location and great facilities	Hotel was in great location for both shopping, lake walking and viewing architecture. We loved having the kitchen facilities and would plan to use them more in the future particularly as a useful supermarket was just beside the hotel and it gives you a good excuse to go to Charlie Trotters to Go ! Staff were great, friendly and helpful and the breakfast, although simple, was just what we needed to get our day off to a good start. This was our first stay in a Suite hotel and we plan to return next year.	
Oct 8 2009 	Excellent service great rooms and breakfast to boot!	We were pleasantly surprised at the quality of rooms for the price we paid. The suite was amazing, we upgraded to a corner suite for $10 more at check-in. My children were absolutely fascinated by the view, and the floor to ceiling windows, so we spent a large portion of our time in the room with the curtains open so they could look out. The staff were very friendly, especially the folks at the breakfast buffet.. The manager came around with little prizes for the kids and we were treated as if we paid a lot more for the room! Breakfast was a treat, waffles, and all the fixin's and then the complimentary dinner in the lobby was a very nice touch as well.We used the pool and although it was a bit small, it was perfect for a bit of relaxing. The hotel is within walking distance of some very nice resturants and millenium park (and also some not-so-nice places, but it's a big city, that's to be expected!). The next time we head to Chicago, this will be our first choice.	
Oct 4 2009 	Great Location Amazing Service.	My wife and I checked in for a weekend with our two sons. Laura at the front desk had put us on the same floor as our friends. Throughout the weekend, she greeted me by name and remembered my room number even though the hotel was busy. We were extremely impressed. The breakfast area was well run as well. The attendant, whose name escapes me, but who was originally from Bosnia, was extreme friendly and thoughtful. It was a great experience at a great hotel.	
Sep 30 2009 	Great Location	Very friendly, helpful staff. The woman helping with the Saturday breakfast buffet was phenomenal - extremely busy but she personally thanked everyone she met for &quot;staying at our Residence Inn&quot;. She worked harder than any waitress I've seen, yet probably rarely gets tips. We tipped her - I hope others will remember to do this too, those folks certainly deserve it.Do NOT get this hotel with PriceLine. They quoted one rate on the internet and when we called them 2 minutes later, they jacked that rate up by $40.00. Do not use them!Valet parking expensive.	
Sep 11 2009 	Just a great hotel staff and accomodations...	I travel a lot for business and this hotel works for ANYBODY!!! It is centrally located near great restaurants, places of interest, and ALL types of stores... nothing is far from the hotel...The staff is great from the manager to the cleaning staff... a well-run hotel at a VERY reasonable cost...	
Aug 28 2009 	pefect hotel stay	I stayed at this hotel for four nights in mid-august. The hotel stay was excellent. Staff was friendly and helpful. Location cannot be beat. I didn't think the kitchenette would be very useful but really enjoyed the convenience of a refrigerator and small kitchen in the suite. I've stayed in about 10 hotels in the downtown chicago area over the last few years and this was by far the best (especially considering the reasonable rates).	
Aug 18 2009 	Good hotel nice location all you need.	Great hotel. Big rooms, We had two different ones, One &quot;normal room&quot; but this was huge too, see photos. Kitchen corner with all you needed if you want to make some food and dishwasher too. Sleeping sofa and sitting area, but very close to the bed so no room for privacy!Also booked a junior suite - came with king bed and a sleeping sofa in the other room. Door between them. Had a full size kitchen with sitting area. Great when traveling with teenagers. TV in both rooms.Lots of towels and every thing was very clean, new and fresh. Maid service was good, did all the kitchen work :-)Breakfast was good, tend to be a bit crowded towards the end of serving time. Good idea to arrive in time! We liked the hot oatmeal with cranberries, almonds.... healthy and nice! You could also have eggs, potatoes, waffle, - all the normal stuff. The Breakfast maid, Ismeta was a daily joy, always smiling, helping and looked after everything. She managed to made every problem disappear and helped everyone. Generally that was our impression of all the staff, very attentive, smiling and willing to help.Gym was nice, good size.Pool also, with a great view! Easy walking to the magnificent mile, to downtown - sort of in between what you want to see. Several restaurants around the corners.Don't miss Rock Bottom, a brewery with good food and lots of local beers. Cabs are easy and cheap and will save your feet from some long distance walking! About $ 22 to the science and industry museum, which is far away but a great museum!Zoo is free and good. Our favorite was the Millennium Park, lots of fun there and totally free! If we goo back we will stay here again!	
Aug 7 2009 	We loved this hotel---the rooms location and experience were great.	We stayed at the Residence Inn Chicago Downtown/River North for 3 nights. I was very happy with the size, layout, and quietness of our room. We were on the 19th floor and had a beautiful city view out our window. The location was perfect as shopping on Magnificient Mile was a few blocks away and restaurants were plentiful within walking distance. Public transportation was a short walk across the river from the hotel and we easily made it to the museums without much extra walking required. The employees were all helpful and provided tips on dining available and directions. My only negative comment would be on the cost of parking $44 per day, but this is Chicago.	
Aug 6 2009 	A pleasant surprise!	We stayed at the Residence Inn, Chicago Downtown, River North, while my husband attended a conference. The hotel is very conveniently located to all public transportation and there are many restaurants within walking distance. The room was spacious, immaculate, with all amenities. All rooms are suites, with a large sleeper couch, arm chair, full kitchen. The full kitchen was a surprise. It had full-sized refrigerator, 2 burner countertop stove, microwave, all utensils. A full, hot breakfast is served daily as well a dinner Monday-Thursday. We expected a few hors d'oeuvres but one night had lasagna, salad, bread, wine or beer, dessert. The next night was chicken Caesar salad with all the other mentioned items. Having both breakfast and dinner would certainly save a family a lot of money! The hotel has an exercise room and indoor pool on the top floor, free access to internet in the lounge/dining area, a very comfortable lobby and helpful staff. It shares an entranceway with Springhill Suites, another Marriott property. I don't think the guests at Springhill have the manager's dinner included in their stay. I would definitely stay at the Residence Inn again.	
Jul 14 2009 	The best of the best for Chicago	We have stayed in nice hotels, this one tops them all. For our family vacation we stayed 4 nights and were able to see everything we wanted in Chicago from this location. Jerry, the General Manager's professionalism showed in all the employees. We were surprised at the abundance of the breakfast and afternoon buffets, and the friendly staff in the dining area, especially Cindy who always recognized our name, and Sara who constantly smiled and asked if she could do anything for us. Truly a great value for the money! We would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to stay downtown near the attractions. The location makes it perfect for walking to nearly everything you want to see.	
Jul 12 2009 	Great stay	The Residence Inn was a nice surprise. After checking in with the General Manager, I realized that if he was running the hotel, it was going to be a great stay. The room was exceptionally clean, spacious, and nicely decorated. The breakfast in the morning was yummy and contained a lot of choices. Finally, the location of the Residence Inn can't be beat. Great restaurants, shops, bars, all within walking distance. Will stay here again.	
Jul 10 2009 	Wonderful hotel! Nicer than my house!	We just spent 2 night here and I did not want to leave! Everything was great--the staff was so helpful and friendly, the room was beautiful and clean, the pool was refreshing (but a little too crowded with wild children), the breakfast and the manager's reception in the evening let us just buy lunch out which really helped the wallet! The general manager Jerry is so nice and his staff follows his lead with warmth and hospitality! Jerry was there in the early mornings cleaning tables so people could sit and he was there in the evenings greeting people and pouring beverages--this man loves this hotel and it truly shows! I would highly recommend a stay here and will certainly stay again on our next Chicago trip! Only complaint would be the pillows are too soft but we all slept great anyways!	
Jul 6 2009 	Great staff great location	Stayed here 4 nights during a business trip to Chicago. Excellent customer service...all staff we encountered were very friendly and accomodating, from the doormen to the front desk to housekeeping. The one bedroom suite was modernly furnished with couch/chair, desk and dining table. Kitchenette was fully stocked with clean dishes and utensils. Plenty of space for 2 people to spread out and be comfortable. Room was very clean and quiet (other than random &quot;city&quot; noises, sirens, etc). Breakfast was great and included scrambled eggs, waffles, cereal, fruit, etc. There is a CVS about a block away if you want to stock up on snacks, bottled water, wine, etc. Lots of good restaurants nearby also.Great location, within walking distance of Millenium Park, Michigan Avenue and Navy Pier. Didn't need our car during the entire stay, just walked or took taxis. Valet parking was $44 a day.Will stay here again during next visit to Chicago.	
Jul 6 2009 	Great hotel and location	Got a great rate ($119 per night) on Marriott.com. Great location was in walking distance to a number of good restaurants (Gino's East, Portillo's, Al's #1 Italian Beef, etc.). Free Navy Pier trolley picks up 2 blocks away and a CTA bus stop is right across the street. About 6 blocks from the nearest EL train station (to get to either airport).Room was clean (and maintained clean throughout our stay). The fold-out sofa is directly across from the bed. It would've been nice if it had been behind a partition or somehow a little more out of sight. King size bed was comfortable, felt fresh every night. Full-size kitchen with full fridge, sink, microwave and dishwasher. View from the room was great. And it was not noisy at all (like I've heard some other hotels can be). Of course, we were on the top floor so that may explain it.Service was OUTSTANDING...we arrived shortly before 10:00 AM and expected to have to check our luggage so we could sight-see before checking in. However, they let us check in 5 hours early! I also asked for a high room and got the highest they have (26th floor). Multiple door men on the sidewalk always speaking and friendly. Front desk crew very courteous. Would definitely stay again!	
Jul 3 2009 	Great two bdrm suite	We booked a two bedroom suite for a girls weekend in June. Having a ton of space plus two bathrooms was amazing. The hotel was in a great location, just a few blocks from the theatre where we saw &quot;Legally Blonde.&quot; All in all, a wonderful stay.	
Jun 30 2009 	Great place to stay!	We stayed for two nights with our 2 1/2 month old and it was great. Our room had plenty of space to spread out in, great furniture and lighting, and free wired and wireless internet. Everything was very clean and it was great to have a kitchen to use for dinners. The staff was so friendly and helpful and the hot breakfast (eggs, sausage, potatoes, oatmeal plus all the normal continental stuff) was a nice perk. The pool is on the 27th floor and has great views over the city, they also have a nice exercise room up there and a laundry facility. The only thing I would warn about is that it's about a 10-15 minute walk to get to Michigan Ave, which for us with a baby made it difficult to get out and shop a lot.Overall a great hotel!	
Jun 29 2009 	Great Location and Service!	My daughter and I spent two nights at the Residence Inn with some friends of ours. This was a GREAT hotel! We booked it for $119/night which seemed like a steal!It was centrally located and we walked all over the city. From the moment we pulled up, the service was impeccable from the valet station to the bellhops to the check-in desk. Everyone was friendly and helpful. There is a small lobby at street level and you take an elevator to the first level to check in. From there, you access a different bank of elevators to go to your room and you need your keycard to use the elevator. I liked this added level of security as my daughter and one of the friends we were with are only 17 years old.We stayed in a studio suite which, I believe, is the smallest room they offer. There was a wall of floor to ceiling windows which made the room seem very light and much bigger than it probably was. It also had a flat screen TV.There was a small but very nice kitchenette which included a microwave, dishwasher, refrigerator and two burner cooktop. There was a king size bed as well as a pullout couch. I spent a night on each bed and both were comfortable. Even with four of us in the room, we felt that it was spacious. The bathroom sink was outside of the toilet and shower area which was very convenient while traveling with two teenage girls! There was no bathtub but a large walk-in shower which we really liked.Free WiFi is also provided which we always like to have.The lounge and breakfast area are on the same level as the front desk. There were four computer/printer stations available for guest use at no charge which came in handy for printing some tickets we had purchased online. There is also a large flat screen TV and comfortable couches and chairs. This came in handy when my friend and I were ready to sleep but our daughters wanted to stay up talking. They just went down to the lounge and we felt that they would be very safe there.The buffet breakfast included a lot of hot items and was delicious. The dining area had plenty of tables with wonderful views of the streets below. Also, if you stay on any Monday through Thursday night, there is a free, light dinner meal provided in the lounge. We didn't take advantage of it but thought that was pretty generous!There is a pool and fitness area on the top floor. I didn't see it but my daughter checked it out and said it was very nice.I asked a lot of questions at the front desk about things we were planning to do. Not only did they answer my questions patiently but also made additional suggestions. I also utilized the valet parking. It was $44 for each 24 hours which, for Chicago, is pretty typical. I checked the car in and out several times and the service was quick and efficient.I travel to Chicago frequently and have stayed at a number of hotels. I HIGHLY recommend this one to everybody!	
Jun 28 2009 	Wonderful stay at this very nice Residence Inn!!! Great staff!	I was very impressed with this Residence Inn. Staff was WONDERFUL. From housekeeping who went out of there way to provide us with something they did not have in stock, to the front desk who offered some free candy to my tired young traveling children (traveled from CA with young children), to the hotel manager, Jerry Keyes, who greeted us kindly during one of the free happy hour meals and asked us how our room was. I was impressed because he was right there helping his staff and very cordial to his guests. The room was excellent (room 2005), decorated nicely and very clean. The kids enjoyed the indoor pool on the top floor. The location is outstanding (close to Navy Pier, shopping- if you like to walk- you could definitely walk to Art Institute- we did it with our three kids). Harry Cary's across the street- yummy food. LOTS of food choices. We had a nice time and felt very comfortable here. This experience causes me to lean towards Marriott when I plan travel for my family. Thank you!	
Jun 27 2009 	Great Hotel	We absolutely love this hotel when staying in Chicago. It has a great location near Michigan Avenue and surrounded by a mix of restaurants. The staff is very helpful, and always friendly. Hotel is clean and modern. I would highly recommend this hotel for anyone staying in downtown Chicago.	
Jun 1 2009 	A superb stay!	I was here for six nights and was very impressed. I typically stay at the Marriott on Michigan or the Hyatt on Wacker, but for this trip I wanted to minimize expenses and the Residence Inn appealed to me. The internet was free here, there was a free breakfast and manager's reception and a full kitchen. The price was right at $129 per night.The staff here is incredible. They went out of their way to help me. My first request was to approach the desk for a tourist magazine like those found in most hotels. There were only a few brochures at the desk but I had only been back at my breakfast table for a few minutes when Julia from the desk walked over with three different travel booklets. She told me if I had questions she would be happy to help.Later i redeemed gift cards and a traveler's check with her and she was great. The breakfast was very nice and well stocked. The staff offered to make the waffle for me and delivered it to my seat. They were very friendly and greeted everyone and continually asked if they could be of service. Likewise, the offerings in the evenings were well presented. It was nice to have a complimentary glass of wine even on the nights I went out to eat rather than staying in. I had my big meal for lunch most days and made it back for the manager's reception. On the evenings that I was in the room the place was quiet and I enjoyed the big television. It rotated so that I could watch from the bed or the sofa. The kitchen was well equipped with pots and pans and dishes. The toaster did not work and I meant to leave a note for the hotel but forgot to do that. I never had a problem getting a taxi at the door but I walked to many places because the hotel is well located. It is within a few blocks of the Metro and the system is easy to use and goes everywhere. Most of the other visitors appeared to be business people but I did see a number of families in the hotel. The only problem for young children might be the lack of a bathtub. I know my two year old grandson is not fond of showers so this might pose an issue. The bathroom is small but the shower is very nice with adequate warm water and water pressure. All in all I can think of no complaints, only praise for the staff and the hotel. I must admit that I did miss room service on a few mornings, but there are trays in the kitchen area and you are free to take the food up to your room so one can sort of have room service though I could not bring myself to wear my pjs downstairs.......all in all a great stay in a great hotel. I highly recommend it.	
May 29 2009 	Great locationvalue and customer service	This hotel was great for families with babies- the dishwasher and large room was a lifesaver! The customer service of the staff was 5 star- incredibly friendly! The rooms were updated and modern and very clean. The housekeeper kept everything clean and stocked and even folded our clothes and lined up our shoes.The location was great- every restaurant and just a few blocks to State Street shopping and also Michigan Ave. Also right next to the river. Millenium Park was also an easy walk.I highly recommend this hotel!	
May 15 2009 	Great hotel - great staff - great location	My wife, 8-year old daughter and I stayed for 5 nights during Spring Break. Unfortunately, &quot;Spring&quot; in Chicago means everything from snow to freezing rain to beautiful, sunny days, each of which we experienced during our stay! The hotel is very conveniently located just a 5-10 minute walk from just about anywhere you'd like to go - shopping, entertainment restaurants, etc.. Close to bus lines &quot;El&quot; lines for destinations further away. We were quite happy with out room - high floor with a King size bed and sofa bed for our daughter. We didn't hear much noise from the streets below, or the fire station at the corner. The kitchen with full size fridge came in handy for storing drinks, snacks etc.. Of course Spring Break was a busy time for this property, with a lot of families staying in the hotel. Kids everywhere (including ours!). The morning breakfast was extremely busy, and the hotel's management team was there each day, clearing tables and pouring coffee, giving the buffet staff more time to keep the food refilled. Same for the evening receptions. It was nice to come back in after a long day out in the cold and enjoy a bowl of hot soup and a sandwich! We took a shuttle van to / from the airport, so didn't need to use the hotel's expensive parking. Walked ot took a bus everywhere we went. With it's great location and good value, we'll stay again on our next trip to the Windy City!	
May 2 2009 	Great Hotel Just a few odd Kinks	Me and my family enjoyed this hotel a lot. The breakfast was wonderful and the evening reception was to great to pass up. Our room was on a high floor, which we prefer, and was very comfortable. There where only a few things that left me with a sour taste in my mouth. As i ordered a beer in the evening i noticed my name was on a list, with every other guest in the hotel. I felt this truly compromised privacy of all the guest staying here.Also, While my nieces where traveling on the elevator it broke and they where stuck on it for 15 minutes. No one stayed on the emergency phone with them nor was the hotel even notified that there guest where stuck on the elevator. I found out about this event from them. It just amazed me that no one in the hotel would contact me over this. They did comp 50$ of our over all stay,	
Apr 22 2009 	Excellent Hotel	We booked 2 studio suites for 3 days. We were able to check in early but was disappointed that one of our 2 rooms was extremely small compared to the other one. It was so small that we would not have any room to walk around the room if we put the sofabed out. The larger room was almost double the size. I couldnt understand why we were paying the same rate for such different sized rooms. I went to the desk to ask for a larger room and was told there were none available near my first room and no other 2 large rooms together available in the hotel, hard to believe since there is 27 floors. After much complaining from me, they said they would try to upgrade me to a 1 bedroom suite but then said they could not since I booked through a 3rd party. Then they did offer me another room but it was at the opposite end of the hotel which was unacceptable to me. I continued to complain and also mentioned that I would be writing the corporate office to let them know how dissatisfied I was and they finally did upgrade me to a 1 bedroom suite right across the hall from our other room. Both of the rooms we had were very nice and clean. Only disappointment was that I found dirty socks underneath the couch cushion when putting the sofa bed out which lead me to believe they did not change mattress pads between guests. The rest of the hotel was also very clean and new looking. There was a very large lobby with comfortable seating, TV, computers, etc. The free breakfast was exceptional with large selection including make your own waffles. The lady that was working in the dining area each morning was very friendly and helpful, she even offered to make waffles for guest, got refills on drinks and made sure everyone was well taken care of. The free dinners (Monday to Thursday) were a pleasant surprise. We had soup and sandwiches the first night, Lasagna, salad, garlic bread the second night, and hot dogs and brats the last night. There was also free soft drinks, wine, beer, and snacks. Have never been to a hotel that served such wonderful free meals. Saved us alot of money. The management staff was very visable during the meals and stopped at every table to ask if everything was ok. It was also very impressive that they even helped clean up tables. Pool was on the 27th floor with gorgeous view. Was a little small for size of hotel. The location of hotel was very good, only about 5 minutes from Union Station, short walk to free trolley to Navy Pier and also bus stops. The hotel provided a nice city map that included excellent directions from hotel to various attractions either by walking, taxi, bus, etc. Was told at check in we would need to use room key to get off elevator (assuming this was for security reasons) but this was not true entire stay. Upon departing the hotel for the train station, we asked one of the men at the door if there was a van that would accomodate all 5 of us. He told us to wait and then proceeded to run up the street. We lost sight of him for a few minutes but then he showed up riding in the taxi van he had found for us. I was amazed that he went to such extreme measure to accomodate us. What wonderful service!	
Apr 15 2009 	A good central location and excellent value	We stayed here for a four day break at Chicago over easter and were pleasantly surprised. The hotel was located only a five minute walk from the Magnificent Mile and a 10 minute stroll to the Loop plus there were a few bars nearby and the excellent Harry Carey Italian Steak House directly opposite. I've no real complaints, we never had breakfast at the hotel as it was a bit early for us plus there were plenty of places nearby. The hotel staff weren't always as obliging as they could have been and the maid service was pretty bad (only fouir bottles of shampoo to last 4 days for three guys, go figure...) even after we'd tipped but considering the price well worth a stay	
Apr 14 2009 	Good DT Chicago Base For Our Family; Great Staff	Our family decided to try this Residence Inn as our base for doing the standard Chicago museum-viewing tourist stay, and we're glad we did. Among similar properties, this gave us the best package deal for what we wanted-- AAA rates plus parking provided a king suite, breakfasts, a pool, and an exercise room.Staff from valet parking in through valet parking out, and everywhere in between, were exceptionally courteous and did their jobs well. The entire hotel was clean and maintained well. The amenities of the Residence Inn chain were all there-- the kitchenettes, the multiple options for breakfast, the weeknight evening foods....During our stay, we didn't find the place overly crowded, and thus our breakfast and pool experiences weren't lessened by mobs. One of the two common-area computers was available the two nights I wanted to check transit routes.Some notes: swimming pool is small (but open by 6:30 a.m.), You're a short walk from a drug store / grocery store, Starbucks (though house coffee is tolerable), and multiple dining options and major transit hubs are a short walk away (and you can catch a bus route right outside the hotel). Be forewarned a fire station is 1.5 blocks away (but even closer to other hotels), so you're likely to get at least a siren during the night.Remember you're in a big US city and prices/facilities reflect it; just plan for it, and bring tip money for the staff willing to serve you. We'd likely return to this place for similar-style Chicago vacations.	
Apr 8 2009 	Will Stay Here Everytime Im in Chicago	I have gone to Chicago many times. The trip before this one, I stayed at the Hyatt on Wacker and as far as comparisons goes, this hotel is just as good if not better. It is located a short walk from the Mag. Mile and the Chicago nightlife/resturants (Harry Carey's and Ruth's Chris are right across the street). The hotel staff was very friendly and the rooms are great (I had the King Studio Suite). The best part was that I had a nice kitchen for when I was entertaining *guests*. If you are looking for exceptional service with a good price, this is the place to stay	
Apr 6 2009 	Great Location and Room	We stayed in a King Studio Suite which had the bed, couch, chair, flat screen TV, and kitchenette. It was a very nice room and the location of the hotel is within waliking distance of Michigan Ave, many restaurants, and nightlife. They serve a hot breakfast in the morning, but was very crowded both mornings. Parking was outrageous at $45/night, so we parked in a garage a block away for $24 a night. Would definetely stay here again.	
Apr 3 2009 	Great experience and a great deal	We had a great experience. Breakfast, evening snack, great rooms, great service...I can't remember a nicer staff. The front desk staff, the food service staff, and the baggage handlers were all so helpful... Always went out of their way to make our experience enjoyable.	
Mar 30 2009 	Popularity of hotel is both blessing and curse	I stayed at the Residence Inn Chicago River North for a spring break trip with my family. Our trip included shopping, theater (Mary Poppins) and restaurant visits, along with a personal business trip to the Merchandise Mart.The hotel is a nice, new facility with standard Residence Inn suites sized a bit smaller for the urban setting. It is in a great location for most Chicago Loop attractions, including State Street and the theater district. We left the car with valet parking and relied on our feet and the CTA (two el stations within three blocks). Valet parking is the only type offered and is EXPENSIVE - $44 per day (i.e., a two-night stay required three days of parking).I am guessing that the great location and the new facility contributed to this being a popular hotel. The Residence Inn shares the building with a Springhill Suites. I don't know how many total rooms are in the 27-story building, but it seemed like a LOT of families stayed at the hotel, even on weekdays. While popularity is a good indicator for the hotel, the sheer number of people does stress the facilities and services:- Free breakfast was packed and often under-supplied;- The wait for valet parking was about 10-15 minutes at check-in;- Elevators take some time for arrival;- The pool is small and usually pretty full of young childrenIf all you need is a nice Residence Inn room and location, this is a great hotel. However, its overall value is diminished by the high cost of parking and the problems of handling a large number of guests.	
Mar 20 2009 	Excellent stay!!!	I stayed at the Residence Inn on Dearborn Street on March 15-17. I do not have a bad word to say about this place. Everything was excellent! Restuarants, bars, and sights are within walking distance to the hotel. I reserved a king room for us (me &amp; my 2 kids) and there was plenty of room for us to manuever around in. We were given a room on the 21st floor and it had a nice view. The full size frig, microwave, cook top, and dishwasher were a great asset; even though we only used the frig. during our stay. The evening reception was a added bonus! We used the hot tub which was very hot (nice after a day of sightseeing). We did not use the pool...there were too many small (and very loud) children in the pool during our stay. Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel without hesitation. I hope to return in the near future, that is, if my budget allows it; it was a 10 hour drive for us.	
Mar 11 2009 	A Great Stay Ruined	My family and I stayed at the Residence Inn Chicago Downton/River North during our first trip to Chicago to celebrate my wife's birthday. We received a great rate through Travel Zoo of $90.00 per night for a Studio room. The rooms were very nice, comfortable, well appointed and roomy enough for 3 people. The hot breakfast was excellent and I cannot say enough nice things about the breakfast room staff.. For the most part, all the staff was very friendly and accomodating. We checked out of the hotel at noon on Sunday as our flight wasnt scheduled to leave O'Hare until 5 p.m. It was raining heavily outside and was in the upper 30's at the time. We stored our luggage and went to have lunch. During lunch I was contacted by the airline and found out that our flight was cancelled and the next flight out would be on Monday morning. I returned to the hotel at 1 p.m to get a room for Sunday night. I explained to the desk clerk that our flight was canceled due to bad weather. Even though we paid $90.00 per night for the previous three nights, I was offered a rate that was double that amount. I asked if we could get the same rate or at least something close to that considering the circumstances and he suggested I use the lobby computer to see if Travel Zoo was offering a reduced rate. I was unable to get any reduction on the rate through the computer. I contempleted going to another hotel but it was cold storming outside. I understand how rack rates work, but I think under these circumstances the hotel staff could have been more understanding and accomodating.	
Mar 9 2009 	Great location clean friendly service	Just returned from 3 nights in this hotel with my sisters. We went for an Oprah taping, which was a 10 minute taxi ride from the hotel. The hotel is in an excellent location, with lots of restaurants in walking distance (Harry Caray's Steakhouse is across the street). The room was very clean and comfortable. Stainless appliances in the well-stocked kitchen. Breakfast was included and was one of the best ones I've had - waffles (which Isme, the friendly server made for us), eggs, sausage, potatoes alond with muffins, cereal, fruit and yogurt. Would definitely stay there again.	
Feb 24 2009 	Pleasant stay	The room was very pretty -- and the full kitchen is a real bonus. Terrific location, and the free internet is such a convenience. We liked it so much that we wanted to book an additional night, but the front desk clerk couldn't figure out how to do it. That was certainly odd (how hard is it to book a room?), but we took it as a sign we should give up on our impulsive desire to extend the trip so we just headed home. Happy stay overall. We will com back for the right rate.	
Feb 23 2009 	Best hotel we've ever stayed in.	This was our first ever trip to Chicago and I had made contact with the hotel prior to arrival for information regarding the surrounding area ( having done hours of research on the net ) . My first point of contact by telephone was with Taschiana on the front desk who was so friendly and helpful but it was Jerry the manager who made our stay.From the moment we arrived we were treated like Kings and Queens. Our room a two bed two bath suite was superb. We had requested a view and the view was amazing.The suite was huge and had everything we could wish for including a fully equipped kitchen.The breakfast each morning was delicious and very substantial with eggs sausage fried potatoes a selection of muffins porridge and fresh cooked waffles cooked for us by Ismeta who totally spoilt us every morning.From Monday-Thursday there was a social hour with free beer and wine and different snacks each night.Both really helped our budget with the falling pound. The location of the hotel is perfect and in the centre of everything and although it was very cold we managed to walk a lot.Chicago has so much to offer but it wouldn't have been the same without this hotel.As a family we have never experienced hospitality like we did here.The staff all of them ,including Chuck who helped to remove a ring that had got stuck on my daughters finger and Asiel &amp; Will who were always at the door to welcome us, were fantastic but our biggest thanks go to Jerry who made us feel like family. We are already planning our next trip in the summer.	
Feb 16 2009 	Loved This Hotel	We were in Chicago for a writers' conference, and I picked this hotel because we like Residence Inn and got a great AAA rate through the Marriott website.The hotel is located on Dearborn and was about 16 or so blocks from the convention hotel. Even though Chicago was COLD, we walked to the conference every day and didn't mind at all (not that that has anything to do with the hotel itself). However, because we walked to the conference, we were able to see the restaurants and attractions that are all close to the Residence Inn, which made it great. The hotel staff was wonderful in recommending good places to dine (Sullivan's offers a prix fixe for RI guests.) and things to see.The room that we had was a king, and it was very roomy. It was decorated very beautifully, although I question having white covers on the beds. The pillow cases and the quilt, while clean, were a bit dingy, which is what happens when you have everything white.My few complaints were that the towels were not the best I've seen (pretty old feeling and looking) and that we did not receive shampoo every day, which I couldn't figure out.We're looking to go back, again, and will definitely stay here.	
Jan 4 2009 	Strange encounter in the bathroom	We visited Chicago for a convention and stayed at the Residence Inn for a week. We were four people and booked a 2-bedroom suite with a rather large living area and 2 bathrooms. One bedroom featured a kingsize, the other a queensize bed. The sofabed in the living area was around kingsize. The hotel is quite new, however the interior appears cheap and the bedrooms relatively small. The wardrobes are way too small for four people. We stayed on the 23rd floor and had quite an impressive view. We had an accessible room, the bell was for the hearing impaired, so that it was connected to a flashlight and made noises similar to a fire alarm, which was quite disturbing...After a friendly welcome we however made a strange first encounter in the bathrooms. Apparently the housekeeping staff forgot to clean the toilets before we arrived, or how could someone explain the excrements in the toilet (see picture)? Furthermore we found severe urine stains under the toilet seats, which was quite unappetizing, too. It took the management about half an hour to come to our room. The lady was quite uncomfortable with the situation and promised us a gift basket. The housekeeping cleaned both toiles and the gift basket appeared about two hours later. However the gift basket consisted of a 4 chocolate bars, 2 cheap bottles of wine and some nacho chips, which was not really satisfying.We did not encounter further problems during the rest of our stay. Staff was friendly, wireless internet worked well. Breakfast was redundant and the evening meal edible. The whirlpool had a nice 270° city view, but was apparently so full with chlorine, that all of us had a rash after using it.Irrespective of the excrements in the toilet I would stay at different place the next time, as the stay was quite expensive (730$/room/night) and the hotel appeared more like a good hostel.	
Dec 9 2008 	Great value in Chicago	This new Residence Inn was a great find in downtown Chicago! It is located on Dearborn, which just a short walk to Michigan Avenue and a couple blocks from the red line train station. First of all the hotel is brand new so everything is clean and in great condition. It is not clear on the website, but this is actually one large highrise hotel containing both a Residence Inn and a Spring Hill Suites (less expensive). The lobbies are one floor above street level and when you come out of the elevator the Residence Inn is on the right and the Spring Hill Suites is on the left. Both have their own check in, eating areas, etc with a shared mini-mart in the middle. The decor is modern and inviting. The weekend rate is significantly less than the weekday rate since this is a business hotel and it includes a full hot breakfast buffet which is hard to find in downtown Chicago hotels. This was the nicest Residence Inn kitchen I have seen: stainless steel appliances, granite countertops, etc... Free wireless internet service is also included. The bed is comfortable and there were two large flatscreen TV's. The doormen and breakfast staff were especially friendly. Within a block or so was House of Blues, Hard Rock Cafe, and Ruth Chris Steakhouse.	
Dec 2 2008 	Great location and value at the Residence Inn Marriott	We have just returned from a weekend trip to Chicago where we stayed at the Residence Inn Marriott. This hotel was newly updated with everything you needed for a great cost. We saw a show at the House of Blue which was a walk-able distance from our hotel. There were ample amount of restaurants, bars, shops, etc from the hotel as well. This hotel is in the heart of the city and very close to the river. The famous Harry Carey's restaurant/bar is directly across the street, which we went to twice! There is an Einstein Brother's Bagel's next door as well, which was convenient for snacks/coffee. All the rooms were suite style with a modern kitchen, sofa and chair, flat screen TV, bed and bath. The kitchen was not fully equipped, but had everything that was needed for a week: glasses, plates, bowls, wine glasses, pitchers, can opener, tupperware, etc. The continental breakfast was open early and was great!! They had multiple varieties of warm drinks (which were good while being in Chicago in Nov!) such as coffee, tea, hot chocolate, etc. There was a waffle machine (popular for the kids!), muffins, bagels, cereal, eggs, bacon, etc. This was one of the top free continental breakfasts we've had. The staff was friendly and helpful. They helped us with directions, getting taxi's, restaurant/bar suggestions, etc. One of the best things they did for us is be honest on what was a walk-able distance for us from the hotel versus needing a taxi. For the value, this was a great hotel. We plan on coming back to Chicago and staying here a second time. I would recommend this to anyone with kids and dogs (they have a pet program)!!	
Nov 30 2008 	Really Enjoyed	Staff was everywhere and always helpful. Although we took a cab to and from Union Station, it was easy to walk around the neighborhood. A bus stop for the northbound 22 Bus across from the hotel at Hubbard, and a Bus stop for the southbound 22 Bus on the backside of the hotel at Clark made it easy to get back and forth from the theaters downtown, as well as to connecting buses to the Miracle Mile and Navy Pier.Bedroom in our King Suite was smaller than the usual hotel room, but living room area and kitchen made up for it. Very quiet room and nice view, especially from the pool area on the 26th floor. Great hot tub! Nice sandwich shop next door, a pharmacy around the corner and down the block, lots of upscale restaurants within walking distance. Also enjoyed the breakfast served. Look forward to staying again in warm weather.	
Nov 29 2008 	Great place for Thanksgiving week.	This is a great hotel only one block from the river. It is easy to walk everywhere downtown from here. As a family with dietary restrictions, it was very nice to have the kitchen and be able to avoid eating out. The breakfast here is huge, and it is included. The breakfast room is nicer than most restaurants. We didn't really need another meal after the breakfast here, maybe just a snack or a light dinner in the room in the evening. There is a manager's reception Sun-Thurs, so it is possible that you could just have an apple or something in the afternoon, and be able to avoid eating out completely! The rooms are beautiful here. Our room was on the 26th floor, and it had two big bedrooms and two full bathrooms. The pull out couch was very comfortable for our 13 year old son. Another child could have slept on the cushion that comes off of the pull out couch, because it is a solid cushion, about 5 feet long and 2.5 feet wide. The two bedroom sleeps six people. We loved being on the 26th floor, it was perfect!!! I wouldn't even look into another hotel for the next time! The rooms are available from $119 a night. Our room went for $360 a night. Be aware that this is a pet friendly hotel, but it is smoke-free. We only saw one dog there, and there was no dog smell at all. The ventilation system is really good. There was a slight sewer gas smell in our bathroom. It was coming from under the toilet. They sealed it with caulk while we were there. They said they would fix it from under the toilet after we left. This is a great hotel and I can't imagine any problem that couldn't be taken care of just by asking the friendly staff. This is a great place for families to stay while visiting Chicago. There were lots of kids staying there while we were there, but the rooms were perfectly quiet inside. GREAT hotel!!!	
Nov 18 2008 	Where Is The Oven???	I just arrived a few hours ago, and I must agree that the staff is friendly but unbending to give a gold member an upgrade. I agree with the smallest suite review!!! I was directed to three other rooms before I found one where I could finally open the drawer in the bedroom without hitting the bed, but there was no bathtub, only a shower. I was also told I would get a view of the fireworks, however on check-in it appears that no one bedroom suites had that view --- or any river view. I bought a pizza to heat only to return and discover there was no oven even though a full kitchen is advertised. There is only a two burner top, a full size refrig and a dishwasher---I would rather have a mini-fridge or no dishwasher and an oven. A lot of people do not &quot;nuke&quot; food. The evening light meal was more than adequate, but staff ran out of pasta and salad and brownies at 7:15, did not make more due to time, but did offer more bread and beverages. This has never happened anywhere I stayed before---especially with the receptionist indicating I could wait until 7:30 to make a plate for my daughter---I went to Trader Joes's and bought some pasta to go with the sauce. Yes, it is complimentary, but very much expected ...there were several other disgruntled families and businessmen. I do not like the split lobby, but obviously the owners are trying to economize in every way they can and have rented out the ground floor. It is probably safer and the second floor dining area is quite pleasant witht he second floor view. Everything is a trade-off. I totally prefer the comfort and amenities of the Residence Inn on Walton (miracle mile),however, it is a bit overrun with the &quot;American Girl&quot; groupies on the weekends and too many unruly children. This is more in the working/business section. However, many convention busses do not stop here and the front desk personnel indicated a one block walk south to the Westin River North when I called. After I checked in, it appears a three block walk to the Hilton Garden Inn for Convention shuttle. On the positive side, it is new and very clean. The internet works very well. I have not experienced the slow elevator problem described in previous emails yet. The staff appears used to the small room comments and are trying to fend the issue as graciously as possible. The top floor pool looked very nice, as did the work out facility...much nicer than the Residence on Walton for work out and that place has no pool. I would suspect this is a foreign owned Marriott as it is not similar to standard for this country in terms of space, amenities, etc. I will check on it.	
Nov 11 2008 	Smallest Residence Inn Rooms Ever	My husband, teenaged son and I stayed there last weekend. We had a one bedroom suite and it was the smallest square footage ever! We had to rearrange the living room furniture to open the sofa bed. The bedroom had only enough room for the king bed and 2 nightstands and about a one foot area at the foot of the bed to walk through. The hotel is very new (less than a year old) and the furnishings, TVs, bathroom and kitchen area are nice. The two TVs were flat screen. They don't tell you the property is joined to a Marriott Springhill Suites and the hotels share a minature pool on the top floor (they also share an exercise room). It took them forever to clean the room on Saturday (they came about 4 p.m. after we had been gone all day). The breakfast was good. There is also no room at the front of the hotel where the valets are--you have to jockey for a spot on the street to load and unload.	
Oct 27 2008 	Excellent stay!	Stop searching for over-priced hotels! We are a picky 35-something couple wanting to stay in an affordable, yet accessible to all the activiites in downtown Chicago. The Residence Inn is really easy to get to. Forget renting a car, hop on the CTA blue line from O'Hare and get off at Clark/Lake Street station. Then, you're literally a 7 minute walk to the hotel! The staff service is excellent. We checked in and received a spacious studio-king room on the 24th floor facing east. Super quiet hotel - I couldn't believe we were in a large urban city. Hotel offers great breakfast every morning. Not just pastries, but eggs, cereal, home cooked waffles, yogurt, fresh fruit, pancakes, sausages, home fries...etc!!! We booked our rate of $189/US per night Thurs-Sunday through AAA directly through the Marriott site. No issues whatsoever. I can't say enough about how great this hotel was and how super CLEAN!!! Stay here, and forget about wasting your hard earned money at those &quot;other&quot; hotels along Michigan Avenue which are noisey and extremely expensive. It was only a 10 minute walk to Michigan Mile, State Street and theatre district. Have fun! Room 2414 was great, and highly recommend it!	
Oct 25 2008 	Excellent hotel location 	We'd agree with almost all the previous positive comments.Yes, the odd 'split/ 2 level' lobbies are not very welcoming, and the food quality at breakfast (and especially the evening) could be better. Also, the bathroom basin should be in the main bathroom, not the bedroom.But, otherwise, we had a great stay. The location is very convenient, with several good restaurants nearby [including a modern Italian one 200 yds away nearer river on N Dearborn St, and a French one (Brasserie Jo's) around corner] &amp; safe; the staff friendly and helpful; room clean and comfortable, and (rare in large hotels) well sound-proofed; house-keeping staff always cleaned our dirty coffee cups and filter every day; our requests re room location were met; check in/out was quick, and we could access our room 5 hours early; perhaps because we were there slightly off-season and mid-week, we had no problems with crowds at breakfast or with slow lifts, and our room keys worked OK; it was so convenient having breakfast included.Noticed hotel had laundry room, which could be very useful.Still building work taking place next to hotel - now West as well as South, so maybe worth asking for a N or E facing room	
Oct 20 2008 	Great hotel pleasant experience	I've stayed in quite a few hotels downtown Chicago but this is definitely one of my most pleasant stays. The rooms are clean and new, but what really took me back was the friendliness of the staff. Every time you see a staff member, they ask you how your stay is going and how your room is and if they can do anything, even if they just run into you in the elevator! The hot breakfast was as good as any breakfast diner in Chicago and the hearth room is comfortable and inviting. I would definitely stay here again!	
Sep 1 2008 	"Great Hotel"	What a Great Hotel stayed Two night, Staff was great!!!4th trip to chicago, Will stay again at the hotel.Shop around for great deals.	
Aug 18 2008 	Great for families with young children	We spent 4 nights at the Residence Inn River North in downtown Chicago with our 3 young children. It was a fanastic experience-my son said it was his favourite vacation ever. The hotel is brand new but the employees are definitely not rookies-everyone that we spoke to was polite, helpful and in a cheerful mood. The hotel was very clean. The included breakfast was abundant. The room was spacious and clean. Our children stayed in the living room on the pull-out couch and a cot without complaint. We used the exercise room and pool every day. The pool was a great afternoon activity before dinner when everyone was tired of walking around Chicago. The hotel's location is excellent. You can easily walk to the Magnificent Mile, the river, Millenium Park, the Sears tower and many other attractions. We parked our car and never used it the whole time we were there. There is a kitchen in each room but note that there is only a 2 burner cook top and not an oven. But there is a microwave. The grocery store-Jewel Osco, is within walking distance if you don't want to use the hotel's free grocery delivery service. All in all we had a great time and will definitely stay at the Residence Inn again in Chicago and other cities in the US.	
Aug 14 2008 	Early Check-Out Beware	We originally booked 2 nights with the hotel. Closer to our stay date, we have decided to make our stay short. So we called the hotel to see if we needed to cancel our second night. We were informed that we did not need to cancel and just check out a day earlier would be okay. We enjoyed our one night stay and checked out he next day at 11 or so. Gave the card to the clerk and asked if everything is okay with our check out...he said &quot;you're all set&quot;. To our dismay, the hotel charged us for both nights and proceed to send us an invoice indicating that we have checked out at 12:59 the second day. So beware and make sure that you get receipts.	
Aug 13 2008	Very nice hotel	We stayed at the hotel in August, 2008 - family of four - 2 adults and 2 teenage boys. We had a one bedroom suite and as others have written, it is small if you plan to spend much time in the room. The bed takes up the entire bedroom and if you unfold the sofa, it takes most of the living room. Fortunately we were out and about most of the time and appreciated being able to walk to everything - Hancock Tower, Michigan Ave shops, Art Museum, many restaurants (Hard Rock, Harry Carays, Weber Grill)Pluses: Nice selection for breakfast, though much too crowded on the weekend days; great location; very clean; complimentary internet terminals (two); friendly staff; and the kitchen was very convenient.Negatives: We had to ask for towels every day, as they only gave us 3 and we were 4 people. Sometimes we had to call twice. Had to wait for elevators frequently. Incredibly heavy door to the room, though it was quiet, so perhaps it blocks noise? Odd arrangement to have to enter in one lobby and then take another elevator to the main lobby, especially when you are carrying luggage.All in, we would stay here again.	
Aug 11 2008 	Vacation	The staff at the Residence Inn was exceptional. Very pleasant and helpful. The lobby was large and clean. However we did request early check in and did not receive it. We arrived shortly after 2pm and our room was not ready. Regular check in is at 3pm. We also requested extra towels for the room, but there were not any extra in the room.We had a corner suite that was suppose to have floor to ceiling windows, but they weren't quite all the way up to the ceiling....AND - the windows had smudges on them from where the previous people in the room had put there hands and such on the glass...that was kind of gross. The sleeper sofa had a matress cover on it when we pulled it out that had hair on it. We had to make the bed for the sleeper sofa ourselves and that bedding was clean. The rest of the room was clean as well. Breakfast was very good. The traditional make your own waffles, cereal, dough nuts and also eggs and sausage. The only problem I had with the breakfast was on the day we were checking out. Breakfast was served starting at 6:30am but this day the food wasn't brought out until 7:00am. This was inconvenient since we had to leave the hotel by 7:15 to catch the Amtrak home. I would stay here again though. The beds were very comfortable and the staff very friendly.	
Aug 6 2008 	Great location very cramped for four people	Our family of four (15 and 20 yr old kids) stayed here for a long weekend. Loved the location, and of course the standard Residence Inn ammenities of free full breakfast, in-room kitchen.Location is good - about a ten minute walk to Mag Mile, 15 minute walk to Navy Pier. Jewel and Whole Foods and Trader Joes are a five minute walk away. Movie theaters, etc are also in short walking distance.Exercise facility has about 12 machines (treadmill, bikes, eliptical trainer) as well as weights. Pool is small - splashing size. Nice view of city from the facility.We reserved an &quot;extended studio&quot; - larger than a regular studio, and requested a fold up bed. When we arrived, we were told that the hotel cannot provide fold-ups due to fire codes. so we made up a bed for 15 yr old son on the floor (pushing the small kitchen table and two chairs to the corner) using the couch cushion and an extra set of sheets/blankets. Be aware that when the sofa bed is extended, it meets the foot of the regular bed, so we crawled over each other all night when we had to get up. And with my son on the floor as well, there was precious little room to spare !	
Aug 5 2008 	In the heart of Downtown	This place is great big rooms with a nice lobby. A good place if you are going to be working in your room. I would recommend this hotel to anyone traveling on Business or pleasure. I was able to get anywhere by train so I did not have to cab it which was nice.	
Jul 29 2008 	My best hotel stay in Chicago yet	My wife and I stayed here for a &quot;working vacation&quot; from July 19th through July 27th. We had a considerable amount of luggage since we were staying for nine days. The bellmen were courteous and efficient and helped us with our luggage both when we arrived and when we left. They were able to check us in immediately even though we arrived at 1:00 pm, two hours early. We had a corner room with floor to ceiling windows on the 27th floor (paid an extra $10 for that). Nice views to the west. The room wasn't large and it had an unusual configuration, kind of &quot;U&quot; shaped wrapping the kitchen, dining, and sleeping area around a central bathroom to allow views on both outside walls. This made it seem smaller than it was, but it was fine. It's close to a fire station. With two glass walls, even on the 27th floor we could hear sirens several times each day, but it wasn't a problem. Full kitchen. Nicer counter top than I have in my own home. The refrigerator is great for leftover deep dish pizza and snacks. Close to many good restaurants and trains. It's a new hotel so everything was immactulate. And the breakfast buffet was better than most I have had. But the dining area gets crowded and isn't quite large enough. I will be staying here again the next time I visit.	
Jul 29 2008 	Overrated	First the positives: the furnishings were nice and comfortable, the fitness room was nice, and the breakfast was fine.That said, when we arrived there was no one to help us with our bags and we had to lug all of our luggage and car seats up to the second level to check in and then up to our room. More importantly, our room (a studio suite) was tiny. With the pullout couch pulled out, there barely was any room to walk. As a further example of how small and poorly designed the room was, the bathroom door did not have enough swing area and would get stuck on the toilet when we tried to close it. This room would be fine for a person traveling solo, but for a family of four forget it . . . and even the solo travel would likely get claustrophobic. Bottom line -- overrated.	
Jul 28 2008 	Loved it!	I booked the hotel through Priceline and got an exceptional deal! The complimentary breakfast is great! They also have social hours in the evening on weekdays and one of the days we were there, they had a band and an open bar!!! The location is excellent, walking distance to the shopping area. The tourist attractions are nearby too, and you can get a taxi to most of them for under $10.2 issues: They have only 2 elevators for the 19 story hotel and we had to wait for it most of the times. Parking is $45 a day, but that is expected in a metro city.Overall, I would highly recomment the hotel to anyone.	
Jul 21 2008 	Loved this hotel!	After reviewing tripadvisor.com I decided to stay at the Residence Inn/River North. This was a 'girls weekend&quot; trip. We were greeted by bellmen who took our car to vallet parking and helped us with our bags. The staff was very helpful with getting us our room. We had paid for a corner city view room. They asked us if we wanted a higher floor so we could see more. (There are 27 floors) My mom was not thrilled with that idea so we were on the 12th floor. We still had a decent view but could see mostly construction. Upon entering our room we found a small kitchen completely equipped with stove, microwave, full-size ref and a small dishwasher. There was a small dinette set by the window. The room was shaped in the shape of a staple. The bathroom was nice sized with a sink and dressing area separate from the shower and toliet. The bedroom was a kingsize bed. They do not have doubles and a sofa sleeper. It was all very tastefully decorated and you could tell it had just recently been redone. It was quite and the bed was very quite. There were two thermostats in which you could control the temps in the two rooms. The breakfast was a nice offering of sausage, eggs, waffles, french toast, potatoes, oatmeal, cereals, fruit, yogurt, breads, muffins, and MORE! It was raining hard when we left. When our car was brought back the bellmen walked us to our car with umbrellas over our heads and they put our luggage in the car. It is in the heart of it all. Just acrossed the street was &quot;Holly Cow&quot; a Harry Carry steak house. We were two streets over from the Michigan Ave. If you want down about 4 blocks you were right at the Rainforest, Hardrock and Ginos pizza. Also, the double decker bus tour stopped right there. We took this tour and highly recommend it. It was a very nice stay and I would tell you to choose the Residence Inn/River North for your next stay.	
Jul 13 2008 	Excellent Hotel-Service is Exceptional!	Brand new hotel in a great location-easy walk to Magnificent Mile. This hotel was crowded, but for a good reason. The entire staff was fabulous, very nice and helpful. Great for families as breakfast is included, and there is a nightly reception at about 6pm. Right across from Harry Caray's first class restaurant. Only thing disappointing was on one side of the corner room, the view was of a hotel being constructed. Staff apolologized and gave me extra Marriott Rewards Points. Would DEFINITELY stay there again. Rate I got was $199, which I thought was real good.	
Jul 10 2008 	Residence Inn was a great find!	We stayed one night at the Residence Inn after calling and receiving a good rate. We have stayed at many hotels in Chicago, and this topped our list. When walking into the hotel it doesn't have a lot of fluff like larger, grander hotels. As for security, at the ground level you go up to the lobby floor and check in. Then you have to take another set of elevators to your floor. The doors to your room is very heavy and seems like security was in the design. The staff is very nice and friendly. Staff even took the time to get a dog traveling with his family a bone. Our room had everything you would want in a room. They had clean silverware, bowls, refrigerator, microwave and other extras. If I had to give a negative it would be that the pool on the smaller side, with a deepest at 4 feet. Don't hesitate as this is a great find in Chicago!	
Jul 5 2008 	Beautiful Stay!!!!	This is a brand new Marriott Residence Inn! It's very comtemporary decor, very clean and brand new! Nice location. Not bad walk to Navy Pier. Taxi to/from O'hare was $36/$40. Breakfast is really nice and better than we expected. There are plasma TVs, business/computer/Internet fax area with nice view. All staff was there to help. Door men and Bell staff were on top of our every need...opening doors, hailing a cab, giving suggestions and directions. Beds are comfortable. We were on 12th floor and pretty good view. Did not visit pool area which is on 27th floor. CVS is right on corner around the block not far at all. Can buy things to cook in your suite and beer/liquor and snacks. Beer, juice and snacks are very expensive in Marriott R.I. mini market. $5 for a single bottle of beer and $3.25 for small bottle of Ocean Spray Cran/Grape juice...ouch! This hotel is connected with another Marriott hotel the &quot;Springhill Suites&quot; I think it's called and it's right next door and obviously brand new too! Great cost and location. I highly recommend. We stayed Thursday, July 3 - Saturday, July 5 and got a late check out of 2pm! Regular check out is 12Noon.	
Jul 4 2008 	Great new hotel in downtown Chicago!	I went to Chicago for Memorial Day weekendI was originally going to stay out by OHare but I did my shopping and came across a great deal on the Residence Inn in the River North section on Marriotts website. Since I was dreading hour-plus El trips back and forth and I was planning on spending most of my trip downtown anyway I made the reservations. Youd be hard-pressed to find a more convenient and amenity-laden hotel for the priceits just off the Magnificent Mile and the Loop, and an El stop is only a couple of blocks away. The only thing that's weird is that one building contains two hotels--one side is the Residence Inn, the other is SpringHill Suites, both Marriott properties.This is a brand new (opened in April 2008) all-suites hotel, containing full kitchens, free Internet, flat-screen TVs and gorgeous décor. The hotel offers a free grocery delivery service as well as delivery from local restaurants if you dont feel like cooking or going out. If youre a baseball fan the nearest El stop is on the Red line so you have easy access to both Wrigley Field (Cubs) and U.S. Cellular Field (White Sox). And dont worry about walking around at nightthis is a very good area. The staff is excellent and friendly. Eating out around here can be pricey (seriously, people, you know you're going to get ripped off for hotel food, why bother eating it?) so definitely take advantage of the kitchen--there's a Jewel/Osco supermarket right near the El station. If there was any quibble it was that there wasn't a remote printer that you could connect to from your room; you have to use the business center where there's only two workstations, both of which seemed constantly occupied by people spamming each other on Facebook. Nonetheless I would absolutely stay here again and would recommend it to anyone wanting to stay in downtown Chicago who doesnt want to sell their firstborn to afford a hotel room.	
Jul 4 2008 	Good Central Location	Overall, this was a good hotel and a good location. I include the word &quot;overall&quot; because we did have a couple of issues. This is a great hotel for families with kids or for business travel but do not expect &quot;luxury hotel&quot; services. We love the Marriott line and stay at Marriotts more than any other hotel but we do usually stay at &quot;regular&quot; Marriotts or JW Marriotts so if that is what you're used to just be aware that there is a noticeable difference in the level of service. We booked a 2-bedroom suite for 5 nights for a family of 4.....mom, dad, 2 teenaged boys. I would stay here again when we are traveling with the boys. If it were just for us, I have other favorites in Chicago.THINGS WE LIKED:The location is good. Easy access to the &quot;L&quot; which we did use. Central location if you're shopping, site seeing or there on business.The rooms are spacious and nicely appointed. Good decor and the pictures shown online are accurate.Free breakfast in the morningBathroom....always like to have a sink area that is separate from the toilet and shower and these rooms do have thatGood laundry facility -- 8 or 10 front loading washers and dryers that do a good job for $1.00 per wash and $1.00 per dryGood fitness centerFree wireless in the rooms that worked wellNice new flat screen tv's in the living area and bedroomLoved having the full kitchenOur rooms had a desk and a kitchen table so there was great workspaceFriendly / helpful staffTHINGS WE DIDN'T LIKE:location....a huge hotel is being built directly south of the Residence Inn. If you end up on that side of the building, you do not have a cityscape view at all -- the windows are dusty and the view is construction and, if you're high enough, roof tops. Our original 2 bedroom suite had this view and I asked to be moved. The front desk manager was MORE than accommodatingThe &quot;living room&quot; furniture looks good but our layout was horrible for watching TV....the chair is comfortable but the &quot;couch&quot; is really not good for sitting on.....although it works well as a sleeperNo mirrors in the living area.....always like to have that in case we are all getting ready at the same timeNo room service -- but we knew that going into it and stocked our kitchen. They also do have some snacks/beverages for sale near the front deskThis is a new hotel and the some of the staff is new to hotel work and it shows. I had dealings with 2 different front desk managers -- both named Katie -- who were fabulous but when I checked in the person at the desk couldn't answer what seemed to be basic questions about the hotel/location, the valets never asked if we needed a cab (but cabs were readily available)The card-keys were a serious problem for us. We went through probably 10 keys....I know, I brought them all home because they say now that you need to destroy them yourself to protect your credit card info.....we were diligent about keeping them away from cell phones, etc but they kept de-magnetizing or something and we had to replace them which meant heading back down the elevator to the front desk.No pay per view movies or video games. If you bring your own video game system you can hook it up to the tvTIPS: If you want a good view while the adjacent construction is going on, request a room that has windows other than on the south sideWhen we switched rooms the manager showed me some rooms on the Springhill Suites side of the hotel. They have corner king rooms that face north/east and you actually get a glimpse of the river and the lake. The view was great but I liked the decor of the Residence Inn better......the Springhill Suites is very &quot;retro&quot; but I'm of the age group that already lived with that furniture once in my life so to me it just looks old :-)Parking is $41 day if you valet park but there is a surface lot directly west of the building that is less than $20	
Jul 4 2008	Wonderful!	As a new property, we expected this hotel to be good - but it exceeded our expectations big time! We had a corner studio suite with an amazingly comfortable king bed, plus a sofa bed, which our adult son slept on and found comfortable enough. Additionally, there was a kitchen and a table and loads and loads of windows! We were on the 15th floor and we even had a glimpse of the river! Breakfasts were good and all the staff were extremely friendly. The location was superb. Cannot be faulted!	
Jun 27 2008 	Great location!	Right in the heart of downtown, this hotel is within walking distance of tons of sites in Chicago. The staff was very friendly, and always greeted us warmly. A breakfast buffet is included in the price of the room and in the evening there was a beer/wine happy hour in the lounge. Loved that!The room was fantastic. We were upgraded to a one bedroom, and loved the space - for a downtown hotel, we thought it was really large.	
Jun 21 2008 	A comfortable property in a vibrant location	We visited this brand new property the week after Memorial Day and were thoroughly impressed. Our suite was spacious and elegantly decorated with art deco flourishes. The service, starting from the car valet to the front desk to the cleaning staff, was flawless, friendly, and without attitude. I wish I could say the same about my previous visits to the Pen and some of the other overpriced &quot;lux&quot; properties off &quot;Boul. Mich.&quot;The suite's kitchen (equipped with range top, microwave, full size fridge, &amp; dishwasher) gave us latitude in getting quality, economical meals at Whole Foods Market 4 blocks away. Doing so let us occasionally splurge at the many quality restaurants nearby--do try a deep-dish pizza at Lou Malnati's 3 blocks away!The property's River North location makes it easy to walk everywhere. Michigan Avenue and its wealth of shopping is a 5 minute walk, as are the vibrant restaurants and establishments of Rush St; the Art Institute and Millennium Park are 20 minutes away by foot. For those less inclined to walk, there is a bounty of cabs eager to spirit you away.Surrounding you wherever you go will be magnificent urban architecture that is constantly evolving and the best antidote for suburban boredom. Be sure to bring a camera!	
Jun 13 2008 	FABULOUS new hotel!! Would recommend it to anyone!!	This hotel was INCREDIBLE!! We were the first ones to ever stay in the room, and it was perfectly clean &amp; beautiful!! It was also one of the least expensive hotels around, but the highest quality!! The Breakfast Bar was huge, with a ton of great food options including fresh waffles, fruit &amp; yogurt parfaits, and donuts. The decor is very modern chic but elegant, and the staff are so friendly!! We also loved the exercise room, with personal TV's at every piece of equipment. The pool was on the smaller side, but it was on the top floor so the view was spectacular!! Right in between the Magnificent Mile &amp; the Theatre District!! A few blocks away from Rainforest Cafe, etc. I have too many good things to say about this hotel!!!!!!! It's FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!!!!	
May 30 2008	1st guests in room	Great location. interesting entrance. Rooms great. 1st guests in room, Spa has great view from top floor, Not enough elevators to handle the busy weekend of Cubs Fans!!!	
May 28 2008 	Brand new hotel in a great location	We stayed at this brand new property over Memorial Day weekend for a great price of $189 a night, which was directly from the hotel website + taxes and $41per night to park. Our studio suite had a small but adequate kitchen, table for two, pull-out sofa and chair and flat screen TV. Nice shower and very comfortable bed. Every person we encountered was very professional and service-oriented. The hotel was within walking distance of Michigan Ave, Millenium Park and Navy Pier and many restaurants.  My only complaint: the breakfast area was very inadequate to handle the increased number of guests on a weekend. I overhead a manager say they were completely booked on the Saturday night we were there, and the following morning there was a line of 20-30 people trying to just get a glimpse of a muffin and the larger than average seating area was overflowing. The two people working could not keep the area stocked, although they gave it their best effort. I do not fault the people working there or the management, who were also working diligently themselves to clear tables, it is a very poorly designed serving area for hotel of this size. We did not have nearly as many problems on Monday, although still quite busy. Otherwise, the hotel was perfect in every way, and I would stay there again, and just not bank on getting a free breakfast.	
May 20 2008 	Brand New Hotel!	I stayed at the hotel on May 13th, and had a great experience. I flew into Midway and took the train to the Loop. From there is a quick 4 block walk to the hotels. (There are two hotels, a Residence Inn and a SpringHill Suites. Both are Brand New.)I was able to check-in early (before noon) and was offered a few different floor options, which was a nice touch. I stayed on the 3rd floor, as another reviewer noted, the main lobby and social areas are on the 2nd floor. I had no problems with noise, and my room was brand new and very comfortable. The only issue I had was there was no remote control in my room, but a quick call to the front desk and I had a new remote. I was in a a studio, didn't use the kitchen, but the full size fridge is a nice amenity, really like the workspace and strong internet connection. Also, the LCD TV was great, I was able to see it anywhere in the room, and the picture was clear. The bed was comfortable, and the bathroom nice and clean. I really like the option of glass door showers instead of the tub, and the Speakman shower heads are great.That evening I stopped by the complimentary BBQ; hot dogs, hamburgers, beef BBQ and even beer. The SpringHill Suites side of the hotel was hosting the Grand Opening party, with even more food and drink. The social areas had tons of sofas, flat screen TVs on the wall and fireplaces. The next morning I stopped by for the free breakfast, again top notch.The gym on the top floor was well stocked with cardio equipment and some weights. Great views of the city as well.Overall a great stay, convenient location to Michigan Ave and the Loop. The staff was very friendly, and the amenities are great. I would recommend this hotel.	
May 19 2008 	Great Hotel - Great Location	We just returned from a four day stay at the Residence Inn-Rivernorth. It is a great new hotel in a wonderful location. We found it an easy walk from Clark/Lake (Blue Line from O'Hare), and close to downtown and Michigan Avenue locations. Since it is new, the rooms are very nice with full kitchens, nice furniture, comfortable beds and nice bathrooms. The breakfast was very good and the staff was amazingly pleasant.	
May 15 2008 	Great Hotel	Just spend 4 nights at this new property. This was the nicest Marriott Residence Inn I have ever stayed in. Additionally, the staff here was great. Every person from the front desk to valet were so polite and so attentive. The building is in downtown and about 3 blocks from Michigan Avenue. It's very easy to get too and valet is right up front. My car was always taken care of and when I called in advance for it, it was there before me each and every time! The lobby level is 2 floors up and you won't believe you're in a Residence Inn. The hotel is one half Residence Inn and one half Towne Place Suites. The Residence Inn rooms are much nicer. Everywhere you look, you'll notice the details. Unlike other Residence Inn's, this place looks like a regular upscale Marriott/Renaissance Hotel. I had a studio which was very nice. Great view from the 23rd floor. The kitchen was nice with granite countertops and stainless appliances. The furntiure was modern and comfortable. The bed was great. The LCD TV was in HD. The bathroom was even nice. As opposed to those useless bath tub's, they actually installed walk-in showers that were a good size and looked upscale. Granted, I don't cook when I'm traveling, the kitchen (primarily full size fridge) was great to have. Breakfast was standard Residence Inn, eggs, sausage and waffles. However, it was always filled and they weren't taking it down at 10 minutes before 9:00 AM. Each and every staff member was extremely courteous and made the stay great. On the 27th floor they have a great gym with all new cardio equipment with TV's attached, some weights, a smallish size heated pool and spa. They also have laundry facilities up there. Overall, I would choose to stay here over the Marriott on Michigan Avenue, the Renaissance on Wacker and two Courtyards Downtown. This place was great!	
May 11 2008 	Great hotel	My wife, myself, her mother and our 5 year and 10 year old stayed here for a week in early May. We booked a two bedroom suite which had two large bedrooms, one with a Queen bed and one with a King bed. The two boys shared the sofa bed which was bigger than we have come across in other hotels, and was more than adequate for the two of them. The beds were very comfy. The King bedroom had a full bath and the Queen had a walk in shower. There was la arge sitting room and a full kitchen. The two bedrooms had plasma tv's and there was a larger plamsa in the sitting room.There was a free breakfast which had a good selection including, scrambled eggs, sausages, potatoes, fruits, waffle maker, cereals, hot oatmeal and various breads and cakes.There was also a free mangers reception Mon. to Thurs. from 6pm until 7.30pm which included a nice selection of hot and cold food and wine and beer.Theres a small well equiped gym and a small pool on the 27th floor. Didn't try the pool but I believe its quite cold!The hotel is located in a very central area a few minutes walk from the shopping areas of North Michigan Ave. and State Street. There are some nice restaurants nearby including Harry Caray's, Maggiannos and for the kids, The Rainforest Cafe and a huge McDonalds.The staff were very friendly and helpful, particularly Kozi on reception. Overall we had a great time and would return again.	
Apr 8 2008 	Loved the Residence Inn	My husband and I stayed here at the last minute because of a great deal they were offering for their grand opening and we were very pleasantly surprised! The staff was enthusiastic, friendly and very helpful and the hotel was well appointed. It is also in a fantastic location and the only transportation we had to hire all week was to McCormick place for a conference. All other destinations (shopping on Mich. Ave., restaurants and art museum) were within walking distance. We would definitely stay here again!	
Apr 7 2008 	Great Stay at the Residence Inn River North	We stayed in a two bedroom suite for three nights (3/31 - 4/03). The room and beds were excellent. The pool and fitness facilities were very nice. The breakfast was great. Our kids liked it better than Embassy Suites. Even though the hotel had only opened three days earlier, everything was running very smoothly.
